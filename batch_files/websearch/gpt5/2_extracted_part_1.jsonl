Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

I’d never seen anything like it, so I did a biopsy. Under the microscope, the cell structure was clear: it was Kaposi’s sarcoma.\"\nDr. Friedman-Kien continued: “A week later, another physician sent me another patient, also a gay man in his late thirties, also with disseminated KS.\"\nLater research would establish that AIDS-related KS is the second most common tumor in HIV patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells, according to the NIH. Up to 30% of HIV patients not taking high-activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) will develop Kaposi sarcoma. * * * * * Source: New York magazine, \"Fighting AIDS\" by Janice Hopkins Tanne, January 12, 1987 POZ magaine, \"A Look Back at the Year a Rare Cancer Was First Seen in Gay Men\" by Joseph Sonnabend, M.D., July 13, 2020 The New York Times, \"Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals\" by Lawrence K. Altman, July 3, 1981To coordinate the task force, the CDC selected James W. Curran, M.D., who would dedicate much of his life to HIV/AIDS research and would publish numerous research papers on the disease.\nTask force members included David M. Auerbach, M.D.; John V. Bennett, M.D.; Philip S. Brachman, M.D.; Glyn C. Caldwell, M.D.; Salvatore J. Crispi; William W. Darrow, Ph.D.; Henry Falk, M.D.; David S. Gordon, M.D.; Mary E. Guinan, M.D.; Harry W.

Austin, M.D.; Erwin Braff, M.D.; James W. Buehler, M.D.; James Chin, M.D.; J. Lyle Conrad, M.D.; Selma Dritz, M.D.; Diane M. Dwyer, M.D.; Shirley L. Fannin, M.D.; Yehudi M. Felman, M.D.; Stephen M.

Many patients also reported that they had used drugs such as amyl nitrite and LSD to heighten sexual pleasure.\n\"Cancer is not believed to be contagious, but conditions that might precipitate it, such as particular viruses or environmental factors, might account for an outbreak among a single group.\"\nAccording to Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, a New York City clinician who was among the first in the U.S. to recognize the emerging AIDS epidemic, this article was significant because of the Times' large, international readership. But doctors treating New Yorkers from the gay community had been noticing strange symptoms and unusual illnesses in their patients for at least two years. \"I had been observing some clinical and laboratory abnormalities among my patients as early as 1979. These included enlarged lymph glands, an enlarged spleen, low blood platelets and a low white blood cell count,\" Dr. Sonnabend told POZ magazine in 2020. \"Then, in April or May of 1981, I was stunned to learn that Kaposi’s sarcoma was being diagnosed in young gay men in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Joyce Wallace, a physician whose office was close to mine on West 12th Street in New York passed this information on to me,\" he recalled. When Dr. Sonnabend heard about the KS cases in young men, he reached out to a colleague, Dr. Alvin Friedman-Kien, a dermatologist at NYU medical center. Dr. Friedman-Kien was caring for several gay men with Kaposi’s sarcoma, and soon Dr. Sonnabend joined him at NYU's virology lab. Through their research, the doctors found high levels of interferon in their patients. Early research and discoveries like this formed the foundation of HIV/AIDS research for many years to come. * * * * * Sources: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), \"Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystis Pneumonia Among Homosexual Men — New York City and California,\" July 3, 1981 The New York Times, \"Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals\" by Lawrence K.

The patient was Ken Horne, the first KS case to be reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Horne had died on November 30, 1981, just days before the conference. * * * * * Source: University of California Libraries, \"The San Francisco AIDS Oral History Series | The AIDS Epidemic in San Francisco: The Response of Community Physicians, 1981-1984,\" interview with James R. Groundwater, M.D., conducted by Sally Smith Hughes, Ph.D. in 1996\"He was fascinating even as a small child,\" his mother Ann Harris told The New York Times Magazine in 2003. \"All the other kids followed him and acted out his fantasies. He did Camelot one time and had the kids on bicycles with the handlebars as the horses' heads. Another time he directed Cleopatra, and used the garden hose as the serpent and our cats as Cleopatra's gifts to Caesar. He was very much the little producer.\"\nWhen his family returned to New York in 1964, George Jr. reprised the El Dorado Players, augmenting the troupe with children he met in Greenwich Village. He took acting and singing classes at Quintano's School for Young Professionals, and soon he was cast as an extra in a milk commercial, a deaf-mute in a television series and an antiwar protester in an Off Broadway play called Peace Creeps, co-starring Al Pacino and James Earl Jones.\nThe latter role would be strangely prescient. On October 21, 1967, an 18-year-old George Jr. would be photographed placing a flower in a gun barrel pointed at him while taking part in an anti-war demonstration at the Pentagon. The photo, widely circulated in the media, became iconic of the anti-war movement and generational divide in the country.When some members of The Cockettes began insisting that they begin charging for their shows, Hibiscus refused and found himself expelled from the group he founded. Unperturbed, Hibiscus formed a new theatrical group called the Angels of Light Free Theater. Their shows included Flamingo Stampede and The Moroccan Operette, which Hibiscus described as being ''like Kabuki in Balinese drag.''\nAmong the people he convinced to perform with the Angels of Light was poet Allen Ginsberg, who appeared in drag for the first time. Hibiscus found another collaborator in his new boyfriend, Jack Coe, also known as Angel Jack, who eventually moved to New York with Hibiscus in 1972, around the same time that the Cockettes disbanded.\nUpon his return to NYC, he recruitd his mother and three sisters (Jayne Anne, Eloise and Mary Lou) into an east coast version of the Angels of Light. “I wrote almost all the music for the Angels of Light,” said his mother, Ann. “George would say, ‘Oh, I need a sheik scene, with a sheik in it,’ and then I would come up with a song.”The group performed at the Theatre for the New City, where John Lennon was known to jump on the stage and sprinkle glitter on Hibiscus.\nIn the early 1980s, he and his sisters and brother formed the glitter rock group \"Hibiscus and the Screaming Violets,\" supported by musicians Ray Ploutz on bass, Bill Davis on guitar and Michael Pedulla on drums. But he had to stop performing in 1981 due to his escalating illness.It's testament to the power of his personality and creativity that the spirit of Hibiscus dominates the 2002 Cockettes documentary, even though the film's focus is on the group. Decked out in gender-bending drag and tons of glitter, the flamboyant ensembles of both The Cockettes and Angels of Light are considered to be the inspiration for later theater productions like The Rocky Horror Picture Show and acts like The New York Dolls.\n* * * * * * Sources: Photo of quilt panel from the AIDS Memorial Quilt- An estimated 185,000-415,000 homosexual males lived in LA County in 1982.\n- If one assumes each homosexual male in LA County has between 13 and 50 different sexual partners per year during 1977-1982, \"the probability that seven of 11 patients with KS or PCP would have sexual contact with any one of the other 16 reported patients in LA County would seem to be remote.\"\n- With this same assumption, \"the probability that two patients with KS living in different parts of Orange County would have sexual contact with the same non-Californian with KS would appear to be even lower.\"\n- Thus, observations in LA and Orange counties imply the existence of an unexpected cluster of cases.\nBorn in 1945 in the Wales town of Haverfordwest, Higgins left for London as a teenager. He worked as a reporter for Hansard, the House of Commons' official record, and in the evenings as a nightclub barman and DJ. In the late 1970s, he would often travel to work in New York and Amsterdam.\nIn 1980, he was forced to put his traveling on hold due to persistent and, at the time, unidentifiable illnesses. In the summer of 1982, he collapsed while at work at the Heaven nightclub in London and was hospitalized. Soon after, he died of the AIDS-related illnesses Pneumocystis pneumonia and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n-\n- Extraordinary care must be taken to avoid accidental wounds from sharp instruments contaminated with potentially infectious material and to avoid contact of open skin lesions with material from AIDS patients.\n- Gloves should be worn when handling blood specimens, blood-soiled items, body fluids, excretions, and secretions, as well as surfaces, materials, and objects exposed to them.\n- Gowns should be worn when clothing may be soiled with body fluids, blood, secretions, or excretions.\n- Hands should be washed after removing gowns and gloves and before leaving the rooms of known or suspected AIDS patients. Hands should also be washed thoroughly and immediately if they become contaminated with blood.\n- Blood and other specimens should be labeled prominently with a special warning, such as \"Blood Precautions\" or \"AIDS Precautions.\" If the outside of the specimen container is visibly contaminated with blood, it should be cleaned with a disinfectant (such as a 1:10 dilution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) with water). All blood specimens should be placed in a second container, such as an impervious bag, for transport. The container or bag should be examined carefully for leaks or cracks.\n- Blood spills should be cleaned up promptly with a disinfectant solution, such as sodium hypochlorite (see above).\n- Articles soiled with blood should be placed in an impervious bag prominently labeled \"AIDS Precautions\" or \"Blood Precautions\" before being sent for reprocessing or disposal. Alternatively, such contaminated items may be placed in plastic bags of a particular color designated solely for disposal of infectious wastes by the hospital. Disposable items should be incinerated or disposed of in accord with the hospital's policies for disposal of infectious wastes. Reusable items should be reprocessed in accord with hospital policies for hepatitis B virus-contaminated items. Lensed instruments should be sterilized after use on AIDS patients.\n- Needles should not be bent after use, but should be promptly placed in a puncture-resistant container used solely for such disposal. Needles should not be reinserted into their original sheaths before being discarded into the container, since this is a common cause of needle injury.\n- Disposable syringes and needles are preferred. Only needle-locking syringes or one-piece needle-syringe units should be used to aspirate fluids from patients, so that collected fluid can be safely discharged through the needle, if desired. If reusable syringes are employed, they should be decontaminated before reprocessing.\n- A private room is indicated for patients who are too ill to use good hygiene, such as those with profuse diarrhea, fecal incontinence, or altered behavior secondary to central nervous system infections. Precautions appropriate for particular infections that concurrently occur in AIDS patients should be added to the above, if needed.\n- 1980\n- 1981\n- 1982\n- 1983\n- 1984\n- 1985\n- 1986\n- 1987\n- 1988\n- 1989\n- 1990\n- 1991\n- 1992\n- 1993\n- 1994\n- 1995\n- 1996\n- 1997\n- 1998\n- 1999\n- 2000\n- 2001\n- 2002\n- 2003\n- 2004\n- 2005\n- 2006\n- 2007\n- 2008\n- 2009\n- 2010\n- 2011\n- 2012\n- 2013\n- 2014\n- 2015\n- 2016\n- 2017\n- 2018\n- 2019\n- 2020\n- 2021\n- 2022\n- 2023\n- 2024\n- 2025\n- 2026\n- 2027\n- 2028\n- 2029\n- 1980s\n- 1990s\n- 2000s\n- 2010s\n- 2020s\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

In return, those countries must permit U.S. citizens and nationals to travel to their countries for a similar length of time without a visa for business or tourism purposes.\nSince its inception in 1986, the VWP has evolved into a comprehensive security partnership with many of America’s closest allies. The VWP, administered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the State Department, utilizes a risk-based, multi-layered approach to detect and prevent terrorists, serious criminals, and other mala fide actors from traveling to the United States. This approach incorporates regular, national-level risk assessments concerning the impact of each program country’s participation in the VWP on U.S. national security and law enforcement interests. It also includes comprehensive vetting of individual VWP travelers prior to their departure for the United States, upon arrival at U.S. ports of entry, and during any subsequent air travel within the United States, among other things.\nPlease visit the ESTA FAQ page for more information.\nAll prospective VWP travelers must obtain pre-travel authorization via U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) ESTA system prior to boarding a plane or ship bound for the United States.\nCitizens and nationals of VWP countries can apply for an ESTA on CBP’s website: https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov. ESTA is used to determine eligibility to travel without a visa to the United States under the VWP. Travelers who do not receive an approved ESTA must apply for a visa at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate prior to travel to the United States. Although an approved ESTA is generally valid for a period of two years, travelers should check their ESTA status on CBP’s website prior to travel.\nIndividuals who do not receive ESTA approval are not barred from traveling to the United States. They may still apply for a visa for travel to the United States at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\nOn December 18, 2015, the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 (the Act) became law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016. The Act, among other things, established new eligibility requirements for travel under the VWP. These new eligibility requirements do not bar travel to the United States. Instead, a traveler who does not meet the requirements must obtain a visa for travel to the United States, which generally includes an in-person interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\nDHS has updated the ESTA application with additional questions to address the new eligibility requirements under the Act.\nUnder the Act, travelers in the following categories are no longer eligible to travel or be admitted to the United States, without a waiver, under the VWP:\n- Nationals of VWP countries who have traveled to or been present in Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen at any time on or after March 1, 2011 (with limited exceptions); and\n- Nationals of VWP countries who are also nationals of Iraq, Syria, Iran, North Korea or Sudan.\nThese restrictions do not apply to VWP travelers whose presence in Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Sudan, Cuba, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen was to perform military service in the armed forces of a program country, or in order to carry out official duties as a full-time employee of the government of a program country. We recommend those individuals who have traveled to one or more of the seven countries listed above for military/official purposes bring with them appropriate documentation when traveling through a U.S. port of entry. However, these exceptions do not apply to the restriction for dual nationals of one of the subject countries (“dual national restriction”).\nThe vast majority of VWP-eligible travelers will not be affected by the new Act. New countries may be added to this list by designation of the Secretary of Homeland Security.\nYes. If you have traveled to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen to represent your program country on official military orders or official government business, you may fall within an established exception to the new eligibility requirements. However, these exceptions do not apply to the restriction for dual nationals of one of the subject countries (“dual national restriction”).\nThe Department of Homeland Security may waive these travel-related VWP restrictions if it determines that such a waiver is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States. Such waivers may only be granted on a case-by-case basis.\nThe restrictions do not bar travel to the United States, but they do require a traveler covered by the restrictions in the law to obtain a visa from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Most U.S. Embassies and Consulates in VWP partner countries and worldwide have short wait times for visa interviews. Please visit travel.state.gov for general visa information or usembassy.gov to find the website of the Embassy that has jurisdiction over your residence.\nIf you are applying for a nonimmigrant visa after ESTA denial or revocation as a result of the Act and have imminent travel for business, medical, or humanitarian purposes to the United States, you may request an expedited visa appointment.\nVisas have some advantages over the ESTA, including validity for up to 10 years versus a general two years validity for ESTA, and the option to stay in the United States for up to six months at a time, as opposed to up to 90 days under the VWP. Visa travelers generally may also extend their stay beyond six months or seek to change to a different visa class while in the United States, neither of which is allowed under the VWP.\nThe additional/modified questions were:\n- Have you traveled to, or been present in, Iraq, Syria, Iran, or Sudan on or after March 1, 2011?\n- Have you ever been issued a passport (or national identity card for travel) by any other country?\n- Are you now a citizen or national of any other country?\n- Have you ever been a citizen or national of any other country?\nBased on responses to the above questions, ESTA applicants may be directed to answer additional questions concerning travel to Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan and potential dual nationality.\nUnder the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 (the Act), and DHS’s implementation of it, nationals of VWP countries who have traveled to, or been present in, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen on or after March 1, 2011, are no longer eligible for travel or admission to the United States under the VWP.\nThis restriction does not apply to VWP travelers whose presence in Libya, Somalia, or Yemen was to perform military service in the armed forces of a program country, or in order to carry out official duties as a full-time employee of the government of a program country. We recommend those individuals who have traveled to one or more of the three countries listed above for military/official purposes bring appropriate documentation with them when traveling through a U.S. port of entry.\nThe vast majority of VWP-eligible travelers will not be affected by these additional restrictions made under the Act.\nThe additional/modified questions were:\n- Have you traveled to, or been present in, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen on or after March 1, 2011?\n- CBP Global Entry program number, if applicable.\nYes. On February 18, 2016, DHS announced that it is continuing its implementation of the Act with the addition of Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as three countries of concern, limiting VWP travel for certain individuals who have traveled to these countries. DHS continues to consult with the Department of State and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to determine whether other countries should be added to this list.\nDHS added the following optional question to ESTA and to Form I-94W:\n- “Please enter information associated with your online presence Provider/Platform- Social media identifier.”\nThe question is clearly marked as “optional” on the revised ESTA application. If an applicant does not answer the question or simply does not hold a social media account, the ESTA application can still be submitted without a negative interpretation or inference. No ESTA application is guaranteed approval, and an application can be denied for a variety of reasons.\nInformation found in social media will enhance the vetting process and may be used to review ESTA applications to validate legitimate travel, adjudicate VWP ineligibility waivers, and identify potential threats. If you choose to answer these questions and an initial vetting by CBP indicates possible information of concern or a need to further validate information, a highly trained CBP officer will have timely visibility of the publicly available information on those platforms, consistent with the privacy settings the applicant has chosen to adopt for those platforms, along with other information and tools CBP officers regularly use in the performance of their duties.\nFor example, social media may be used to support or corroborate a traveler’s application information, which will help facilitate legitimate travel by providing an additional means to adjudicate issues related to relevant questions about identity, occupation, previous travel, and other factors. It may also be used to identify potential deception or fraud. Social media may help distinguish individuals of additional concern from those individuals whose information substantiates their eligibility for travel.\nDHS will handle social media identifiers in the same manner as other information collected through ESTA. DHS has documented these procedures in the updated ESTA System of Records Notice (SORN) and Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), which are available on the DHS website (http://www.dhs.gov/topic/privacy).\nYes. All ESTA applicants must complete all non-optional fields on the ESTA application.\nThe social media question is optional. The ESTA application will clearly inform the applicant that answering it is optional.\nCBP continues to engage with the Departments of State and Commerce in outreach to the public. CBP and the Department of State also post new information and frequently asked questions on their websites, http://www.cbp.gov and travel.state.gov.\nWe strongly urge all travelers to acquire an ESTA authorization or a valid U.S. visa prior to making travel reservations. If you are concerned about your ESTA status, please go to https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov to verify. All travelers should verify their ESTA status prior to traveling.\nYes, under the new Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security may waive these new travel-related VWP restrictions if the Secretary determines that such a waiver is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States. Such waivers will be granted only on a case-by-case basis.\nYou do not apply separately for a waiver. Travelers can apply for an ESTA and whether they are eligible for a waiver will be determined on a case-by-case basis as part of the ESTA process, consistent with the terms of the law.\nIf you wish to travel to the United States and your ESTA is denied or revoked, you must apply for a nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate to travel to the United States. If you are applying for a nonimmigrant visa after an ESTA denial or revocation as a result of the new Act and have imminent travel for business, medical, or humanitarian purposes to the United States, you may request an expedited visa appointment. We suggest that you retain a copy of any ESTA denial or revocation; it may be requested in order to schedule an expedited appointment.\nAll changes to the ESTA process will be announced on CBP’s website, www.cbp.gov. Please keep up to date via the website for all ESTA changes. Travelers whose ESTA status has changed as a result of these new eligibility requirements will be notified via the email address provided in the applicant’s ESTA application. We strongly encourage all travelers to verify their ESTA status and update appropriate contact information prior to traveling to the United States.\nAdditionally, all changes to the ESTA form go through notice (in the Federal Register) and public comment under the Paperwork Reduction Act and are available on reginfo.gov under OMB Control Number 1651-0111. The public is invited to provide CBP with feedback during the public comment periods that accompany each change to the form. DHS will provide notice to the public through an update to the ESTA SORN and Privacy Impact Assessment prior to changing the ESTA application.\nNo. If you are not covered by the new eligibility requirements of the Act and you have not had your ESTA revoked, you do not have to reapply for a new ESTA authorization until your current one expires. CBP recommends that you check the status of your ESTA authorization prior to making a reservation to travel to the United States and prior to your actual travel.\nHowever, if you have traveled to one of the seven countries covered by the new eligibility requirements on or after March 1, 2011, CBP recommends that you do apply for a new ESTA authorization to help facilitate your travel to the United States, or apply for a visa.\nWe will make nationality determinations in accordance with U.S. legal standards and practices, not merely by reference to the laws and practices of foreign governments. If an individual believes that he or she is eligible for an ESTA travel authorization, the individual should apply for an ESTA and answer all questions truthfully and accurately. An individual’s eligibility for an ESTA authorization is determined in accordance with U.S. law. If you have any questions, please contact CBP at 1-202-325-8000.\nA government official is an individual performing official duties or services for the government of a VWP country.\nDuring the admissions process, CBP will review any documents presented at a port of entry that demonstrate a VWP traveler meets the official government or military exceptions under the new Act. Travelers are recommended to bring certain documentation with them when they travel to the United States, including but not limited to, travel orders, official or diplomatic visas, or an official letter from a VWP country government entity, if available. Travelers may also be asked questions about their travel during the admissions process.\nGlobal Entry is a CBP program (separate from ESTA) that allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival in the United States. Members enter the United States using automatic kiosks at select airports.\nTravelers can apply for Global Entry at www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry.\nTravelers who are members of CBP’s Global Entry program have been extensively vetted by CBP. If an applicant is a Global Entry member, he/she has already voluntarily given CBP additional information including his/her fingerprints, photograph and travel history, and been interviewed by a CBP Officer. That additional information can be used in adjudicating the traveler’s application for an ESTA.\nThere is no plan to increase the ESTA fee when the changes take effect. Travelers who apply for a new ESTA through the enhanced system will be charged the standard ESTA fee.\nNo. DHS does not have the legal authority to waive the ESTA fee. The fee is a processing fee per application. Travelers who apply for visas will be required to pay the associated visa processing fee.\nDHS will handle the new information in the same manner as other information collected through ESTA and will document these procedures in the SORN and PIA. As before, DHS will screen intending VWP travelers to determine their eligibility to travel to the United States under the VWP. The additional questions will be used to help CBP personnel determine whether applicants are eligible for travel and admission to the United States under the VWP.\nThe information collected by and maintained in ESTA may be used by other components of DHS on a strictly need-to-know basis consistent with the component's mission.\nUnder current agreements between DHS and the Department of State (DOS), information submitted during an ESTA application may be shared with consular officers of DOS to assist them in determining whether a visa should be issued to an applicant after an ESTA travel authorization application has been denied.\nInformation may be shared with appropriate federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign governmental agencies or multilateral governmental organizations responsible for investigating or prosecuting the violations of, or for enforcing or implementing, a statute, rule, regulation, order or license, or where DHS believes information would assist enforcement of civil or criminal laws.\nAdditionally, information may be shared when DHS reasonably believes such use will assist in anti-terrorism efforts or intelligence gathering related to national or international security or transnational crime. All sharing, including the sharing mentioned above, will remain consistent with the ESTA SORN, which was last published in the Federal Register on September 2, 2016. All DHS SORNs are available on the DHS web site: https://www.dhs.gov/topic/privacy.\nAlthough carriers will not receive the ESTA application information that travelers provide to DHS, they will receive confirmation of a passenger's ESTA status via the Advance Passenger Information System indicating whether an ESTA is required and whether authorization has been granted.\nThe data retention period remains unchanged. ESTA application data remains active for the period of time that the approved ESTA is valid, which is generally two years, or until the traveler’s passport expires, whichever comes first. DHS then maintains this information for an additional year, after which it is archived for 12 years—with further limited access—to allow retrieval of the information for law enforcement, national security, or investigatory purposes.\nThese policies are consistent with both CBP’s search authority and with the border security mission mandated for CBP by Congress. Data linked to active law enforcement lookout records, CBP matches to enforcement activities, and/or investigations or cases, including applications for ESTAs that are denied, will remain accessible for the life of the law enforcement activities to which they are related.\nCBP remains committed to protecting the privacy and civil rights and civil liberties of all travelers. CBP will handle the new information in the same manner as other information collected through ESTA and has documented these procedures in the SORN and PIA. Information submitted by applicants through the ESTA website will continue to be subject to the same strict privacy provisions, use limitations, and access controls that are currently in place for ESTA, and consistent with similar traveler screening programs.\nThe revisions to the ESTA data elements fall under the PRA since DHS is amending an information collection.\nNo. The new VWP eligibility requirements do not bar legitimate travel to the United States. If a traveler is not granted an ESTA, the traveler will need to obtain a U.S. visa from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\nDHS is committed to facilitating legitimate trade and travel while maintaining the highest standards of security and border protection. Requirements for travel to the United States have increased, especially since September 11, 2001, to enhance security at U.S. borders; however, the flow of goods and visitors into the United States continues to grow each year.\nNo. The requirements for a nonimmigrant visitor (B1/B2) visa are different under U.S. law and more complex than the requirements for an ESTA. Applicants for a B1/B2 visa must complete an online visa application (DS-160) and, with limited exception, appear for an interview with a U.S. consular officer. Part of the visa application process requires that applicants submit their biometric information in advance of travel and provide additional biographic information as required.\nCountries that participate in the VWP are required to have a high degree of security cooperation with the United States, such as signing and implementing information sharing agreements regarding known, suspected or potential terrorists and serious criminals; reporting lost and stolen passport data to Interpol or via other means approved by the United States; and issuing International Civil Aviation Organization-compliant electronic passports. VWP countries are also subject to biennial eligibility reviews, which provide DHS with the opportunity to conduct broad and consequential inspections of foreign security standards and operations, and verify the level of law enforcement and counterterrorism cooperation with the United States. The Director of National Intelligence is required to complete an intelligence assessment to support each eligibility review conducted by DHS.\nVWP travelers must obtain approval through the ESTA process prior to commencing VWP travel to the United States. ESTA continuously vets applicants’ biographic information against the Terrorist Screening Database; lost and stolen passport records (including INTERPOL’s Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database); visa revocations; previous VWP refusals; expedited removals; and Public Health records (e.g., records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for persons who have a communicable disease constituting a public health threat).\nThe new eligibility requirements apply to all VWP applicants regardless of mode of entry. If you do not meet one of the new eligibility requirements established by the Act, you are ineligible for travel and admission to the United States under the VWP. You will be required to obtain a nonimmigrant visa. Waivers for a respondent’s travel history will not be adjudicated at the border through the I-94W.\nYes. Effective April 1, 2016, all VWP country nationals must possess an electronic passport to travel to the United States under the VWP. If not in possession of an electronic passport, a valid nonimmigrant visa is required to travel to the United States.\nThe U.S. Department of State designated Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism (SST) on January 12, 2021.With limited exceptions, a traveler who is found to have visited Cuba on or after this date is not eligible for travel under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) using an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) and must apply for a visa to travel to the United States. Additionally, a traveler who at the time of application for an ESTA holds dual nationality with both a VWP country and Cuba is not eligible for travel under the VWP using an ESTA and must apply for a visa to travel to the United States.\nIf an ESTA has already been approved and it is later determined that the traveler has been present in Cuba or holds dual nationality with both a VWP country and Cuba, the ESTA will be revoked. Ineligibility for an ESTA is not a bar to travel to the United States. Individuals who are not eligible to travel under the VWP may apply for a visa at any U.S. embassy or consulate.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Among other things, that legislation established a separate classification for certain commercial and industrial property within the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority (NVTA) and the Hampton Road Transportation Authority. Localities within those two transportation authorities may now impose a property tax on commercial and industrial property, and the revenues from any such levy must be used exclusively for transportation purposes that benefit the locality imposing the levy.\nFairfax County lies within the boundaries of NVTA, and pursuant to that 2007 state legislation, the County is authorized by law to separately classify certain commercial and industrial property for the transportation tax. On September 10, 2007 and as amended on December 3, 2007, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors advertised and held public hearings to adopt a local ordinance to implement that new classification.\nState law allows a maximum rate of up to $0.125 per $100 of assessed valuation to be levied for this tax. The revenue raised is used for transportation purposes in Fairfax County, subject to appropriation by the Board of Supervisors. This tax is collected at the same time and on the same bill as normal General Fund taxes (i.e., in two installments, due July 28 and December 5).\nResidentially used properties, including apartments, mobile home, and senior care properties are not subject to this tax levy. All commercial and industrially used parcels, including vacant land parcels that have a commercial/industrial zoning, will be subject to this tax levy. If a parcel has a residential zoning, but is used for commercial/industrial purposes, it will also be subject to the tax levy. If a property is being used for both residential and commercial/industrial uses (mixed use), the portion of the property used for commercial/industrial uses will be subject to the tax levy.\nPHASE 1 & 2 DULLES RAIL TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT\nPhase 1\nThis special tax district operates on a levy of $0.090 per $100 assessed value on commercial and industrial zoned property (including commercial apartments), or property used for commercial or industrial purposes within the district. This tax levy does not apply to residential property. This transportation improvement district was approved by the Board of Supervisors at the June 21, 2004 board meeting.\nPhase 2\nThis special tax district has a tax rate of $0.140 per $100 assessed value on commercial and industrial zoned property (including commercial apartments), or property used for commercial or industrial purposes within the district. This tax levy does not apply to residential property. This transportation improvement district was approved by the Board of Supervisors at the December 21, 2009 board meeting.\nTYSONS SERVICE DISTRICT\nThese district covers approximately 6,000 commercial and residential property owners in Tysons. The money generated by the district may only be used to make transportation improvements within the service district, and will be used for:\n- Planning and constructing infrastructure and transit routes\n- Buying rights-of-way to build, improve, and/or operate roads or other transportation infrastructure projects\n- Equipping, operating, and maintaining transit services\nINFESTATION PREVENTION (PEST INFESTATION CONTROL - SPECIAL TAX DISTRICT)\nThe Pest Infestation Control Special Tax District is a countywide tax levy that supports the Integrated Pest Management Program.\nThe Integrated Pest Management Program includes two separate programs: the Forest Pest Program managed by the Urban Forest Management Division of the Department of Public Works and Environmental Services and the Disease-Carrying Insects Program managed by the Health Department.\nThe Forest Pest Program currently focuses on preventing the spread of specific forest insects and diseases in the county. Currently, there are five insects and two diseases on the list maintained by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services: the gypsy moth, cankerworm, emerald ash borer, hemlock woolly adelgid, Asian longhorned beetle, sudden oak death, and thousand canker disease.\nThe Disease-Carrying Insects Program focuses on controlling the spread of the West Nile virus, Lyme disease, and other mosquito and tick-borne diseases.\nTOWN OF HERNDON REAL ESTATE TAX\nOn March 8, 2022, Fairfax County and the Town of Herndon entered into an agreement whereby the county’s Department of Tax Administration (DTA) will collect current real property taxes owed to the town, as well as delinquent taxes from June 1, 2022, and forward years. Any invoices or past due invoices prior to the 2022 tax year will be billed by the town. This new agreement will allow property owners in the town to receive and pay just one bill, for both county and town taxes, rather than two separate bills.\nSERVICE CHARGES\nFor some properties, an additional service charge is added to the basic real estate tax. Your assessment notice shows whether your property is subject to any of these service charges. If you have any questions, please contact our office.\nLeaf Collection - Tax Year 2025 rate is $0.019 per $100 of assessed value on residential, commercial, and industrial properties within some districts.\nRefuse Collection - Tax Year 2025 fee is $610 annually within some districts.\nWater Service:\n- Springfield Water Service District 1 - $661 annually commencing July 1, 1993 and ending June 30, 2023, for the purpose of providing water service to Clifton Forest, a group of homes within the Lincoln-Lewis-Vannoy Conservation District.

The clerk shall include within the certificate the amount of such tax collected thereon.\nB. Taxes imposed by this section shall be collected as provided in § 58.1-812 and the clerk shall return taxes collected hereunder one-half into the state treasury and one-half into the treasury of the locality.\nThe local portion of the tax imposed by this section on property that is located in more than one jurisdiction shall be collected by the clerk in proportion to the value of the property located in each such locality when recorded therein.\nEvery clerk of court collecting taxes under this section for the county or city that he serves shall be entitled to compensation for such service at five percent of the amount so collected and paid.\nCode 1950, § 58-54.1; 1970, c. 772; 1972, c. 186; 1976, c. 558; 1982, c. 630; 1984, cc. 397, 675; 1988, c. 200; 2007, cc. 748, 768; 2012, c. 513; 2016, c. 662; 2020, c. 866.\nRepealed by Acts 2018, cc. 854 and 856, cl. 4, effective May 25, 2018.\nIn addition to any other tax or fee imposed under the provisions of this chapter, a fee, delineated as the \"regional WMATA capital fee,\" is hereby imposed on each deed, instrument, or writing by which lands, tenements, or other realty located in any county or city that is a member of the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority is sold and is granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to or vested in the purchaser or any other person, by such purchaser's direction.

In the event of an open, credit line, or revolving deed of trust, the amount of the obligation for purposes of this section shall be the maximum amount secured that may be outstanding at any one time, regardless of the amount owed or outstanding at the time the instrument is recorded.\n2. In any case in which the amount which may be secured under a deed of trust or mortgage is not ascertainable, or in which the obligations described are not fully secured because they exceed the fair market value of the property conveyed, the tax shall be based upon the fair market value of the property conveyed, determined as of the date of the deed of trust or mortgage. The fair market value of the property shall include the value of any realty required by the terms of the deed of trust or mortgage to be constructed thereon.\nB. On deeds of trust or mortgages upon the works and property of a railroad lying partly within the Commonwealth and partly without the Commonwealth, the tax shall be only upon such proportion of the amount of bonds, or other obligations secured thereby, as the number of miles of the line of such company in the Commonwealth bears to the whole number of miles of the line of such company conveyed by such deed of trust or mortgage.\nOn a deed of trust or mortgage (i) that conveys (a) property lying partly within the Commonwealth and partly outside the Commonwealth or (b) property within the Commonwealth to secure bonds or obligations secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on property outside the Commonwealth and (ii) that secures the entire amount of such bonds or obligations, the tax herein imposed shall be only upon such proportion of the bonds or obligations as the actual value of the property located within the Commonwealth, or which may be brought into the Commonwealth, bears to the actual value of the entire amount of property conveyed by such deed of trust or mortgage or to the entire amount of property conveyed by all of such deeds of trust or mortgages to secure the bonds or obligations, as applicable, subject to the limitations set forth in subdivision A 2.\nC. On deeds of trust or mortgages, which provide for an initial issue of bonds, to be followed thereafter by additional bonds, unlimited in amount, if such deed of trust or mortgage provides that as and when such additional bonds are issued a supplemental indenture shall be recorded in the office in which the original deed of trust or mortgage is first recorded, which supplement shall contain a statement as to the amount of the additional bonds to be issued, then the tax shall be paid upon the initial amount of bonds when the original deed of trust is recorded and thereafter on each additional amount of bonds when the supplemental indenture relating to such additional bonds is recorded.\nD. 1. On deeds of trust, mortgages, or other instruments that are supplemental to, wrap around, or modify the terms of an existing deed of trust or mortgage, on which the tax imposed hereunder has already been paid, the tax shall be paid only on that portion of the face amount of the bond or obligation secured thereby which is in addition to the amount of the original debt or obligation secured by the deed of trust or mortgage on which tax has been paid. The tax shall be calculated using the rate scale in subsection F, starting at the point on the scale that applies to the first dollar in excess of the amount of the original debt or obligation secured by the prior instrument. In the event of an open, credit line, or revolving deed of trust, the additional amount secured shall be the amount by which the original obligation secured by the supplemental instrument exceeds the maximum obligation secured by the prior instrument, regardless of the amount owed or outstanding at the time those instruments were recorded. The instrument shall certify the amount of the original debt or obligation secured, subject to the limitation set forth in subdivision A 2.\n2. If the principal amount of the obligation secured by the prior instrument is increased by the supplemental instrument, the tax imposed under this section shall be paid only on the amount of the increase over the original amount secured by the prior instrument.

Any instrument may also be recorded free of tax and fee in the office of the clerk where such instrument was originally recorded when the record containing such instrument has been destroyed.\nB. The tax on every deed, deed of trust, contract or other instrument shall be determined and collected by the clerk in whose office the instrument is first offered for recordation. The clerk may ascertain the consideration of the deed or of the instrument, the actual value of the property conveyed, and the qualification of the deed or instrument for any exemption claimed by inquiry, affidavit, declaration or other extrinsic evidence acceptable to the clerk. The fee shall be $3 on every recorded deed, deed of trust, contract, or other instrument pursuant to § 58.1-817 and shall be collected by the clerk in whose office the deed is offered for recordation.\nC. Any person who knowingly misrepresents the consideration for the interest in property conveyed by a deed or other instrument or any of the other information requested by the clerk of court pursuant to this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. If an understatement of the consideration is false or fraudulent with intent to evade a tax, a penalty equal to 100 percent of the tax due on the understatement shall be added to the amount of the tax due, plus interest on the tax at a rate determined in accordance with § 58.1-15 from the time the tax was required by law to be filed until paid.\nD. Except as otherwise specifically provided, nothing contained in this chapter shall limit the right of the parties to any deed, deed of trust, contract, lease, or other instrument to allocate responsibility for the payment of the recordation taxes and fees imposed under this chapter among themselves in any manner they determine. A clerk who in good faith collects such taxes and fees upon recordation of a deed, deed of trust, contract, lease, or other instrument in reliance upon information provided by the person submitting such deed, deed of trust, contract, lease, or other instrument for recordation shall have no personal liability for any deficiency in the amount of such taxes or fees collected that is later determined to be due and payable.\nCode 1950, §§ 58-63, 58-65; 1978, c. 693; 1984, c. 675; 1988, cc. 421, 738; 2004, c. 990; 2009, cc. 95, 686; 2015, cc. 434, 488; 2020, c. 623.\nThe Department may assess and collect any tax imposed by this chapter which has remained uncollected for thirty days.

In 2007, losses on mortgage-related financial assets began to cause strains in global financial markets, and in December 2007 the US economy entered a recession. That year several large financial firms experienced financial distress, and many financial markets experienced significant turbulence. In response, the Federal Reserve provided liquidity and support through a range of programs motivated by a desire to improve the functioning of financial markets and institutions, and thereby limit the harm to the US economy.1 Nonetheless, in the fall of 2008, the economic contraction worsened, ultimately becoming deep enough and protracted enough to acquire the label \"the Great Recession.\" While the US economy bottomed out in the middle of 2009, the recovery in the years immediately following was by some measures unusually slow. The Federal Reserve has provided unprecedented monetary accommodation in response to the severity of the contraction and the gradual pace of the ensuing recovery. In addition, the financial crisis led to a range of major reforms in banking and financial regulation, congressional legislation that significantly affected the Federal Reserve.\nRise and Fall of the Housing Market\nThe recession and crisis followed an extended period of expansion in US housing construction, home prices, and housing credit. This expansion began in the 1990s and continued unabated through the 2001 recession, accelerating in the mid-2000s. Average home prices in the United States more than doubled between 1998 and 2006, the sharpest increase recorded in US history, and even larger gains were recorded in some regions. Home ownership in this period rose from 64 percent in 1994 to 69 percent in 2005, and residential investment grew from about 4.5 percent of US gross domestic product to about 6.5 percent over the same period. Roughly 40 percent of net private sector job creation between 2001 and 2005 was accounted for by employment in housing-related sectors.\nThe expansion in the housing sector was accompanied by an expansion in home mortgage borrowing by US households. Mortgage debt of US households rose from 61 percent of GDP in 1998 to 97 percent in 2006. A number of factors appear to have contributed to the growth in home mortgage debt. In the period after the 2001 recession, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) maintained a low federal funds rate, and some observers have suggested that by keeping interest rates low for a \"prolonged period\" and by only increasing them at a \"measured pace\" after 2004, the Federal Reserve contributed to the expansion in housing market activity (Taylor 2007). However, other analysts have suggested that such factors can only account for a small portion of the increase in housing activity (Bernanke 2010). Moreover, the historically low level of interest rates may have been due, in part, to large accumulations of savings in some emerging market economies, which acted to depress interest rates globally (Bernanke 2005). Others point to the growth of the market for mortgage-backed securities as contributing to the increase in borrowing. Historically, it was difficult for borrowers to obtain mortgages if they were perceived as a poor credit risk, perhaps because of a below-average credit history or the inability to provide a large down payment. But during the early and mid-2000s, high-risk, or \"subprime,\" mortgages were offered by lenders who repackaged these loans into securities. The result was a large expansion in access to housing credit, helping to fuel the subsequent increase in demand that bid up home prices nationwide.\nEffects on the Financial Sector\nAfter home prices peaked in the beginning of 2007, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency House Price Index, the extent to which prices might eventually fall became a significant question for the pricing of mortgage-related securities because large declines in home prices were viewed as likely to lead to an increase in mortgage defaults and higher losses to holders of such securities. Large, nationwide declines in home prices had been relatively rare in the US historical data, but the run-up in home prices also had been unprecedented in its scale and scope. Ultimately, home prices fell by over a fifth on average across the nation from the first quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2011. This decline in home prices helped to spark the financial crisis of 2007-08, as financial market participants faced considerable uncertainty about the incidence of losses on mortgage-related assets. In August 2007, pressures emerged in certain financial markets, particularly the market for asset-backed commercial paper, as money market investors became wary of exposures to subprime mortgages (Covitz, Liang, and Suarez 2009). In the spring of 2008, the investment bank Bear Stearns was acquired by JPMorgan Chase with the assistance of the Federal Reserve. In September, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and the next day the Federal Reserve provided support to AIG, a large insurance and financial services company. Citigroup and Bank of America sought support from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nThe Fed's support to specific financial institutions was not the only expansion of central bank credit in response to the crisis. The Fed also introduced a number of new lending programs that provided liquidity to support a range of financial institutions and markets. These included a credit facility for \"primary dealers,\" the broker-dealers that serve as counterparties for the Fed's open market operations, as well as lending programs designed to provide liquidity to money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market. Also introduced, in cooperation with the US Department of the Treasury, was the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which was designed to ease credit conditions for households and businesses by extending credit to US holders of high-quality asset-backed securities.\nInitially, the expansion of Federal Reserve credit was financed by reducing the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities, in order to avoid an increase in bank reserves that would drive the federal funds rate below its target as banks sought to lend out their excess reserves. But in October 2008, the Federal Reserve gained the authority to pay banks interest on their excess reserves. This gave banks an incentive to hold onto their reserves rather than lending them out, thus mitigating the need for the Federal Reserve to offset its expanded lending with reductions in other assets.2\nEffects on the Broader Economy\nThe housing sector led not only the financial crisis, but also the downturn in broader economic activity. Residential investment peaked in 2006, as did employment in residential construction. The overall economy peaked in December 2007, the month the National Bureau of Economic Research recognizes as the beginning of the recession. The decline in overall economic activity was modest at first, but it steepened sharply in the fall of 2008 as stresses in financial markets reached their climax. From peak to trough, US gross domestic product fell by 4.3 percent, making this the deepest recession since World War II. It was also the longest, lasting eighteen months. The unemployment rate more than doubled, from less than 5 percent to 10 percent.\nIn response to weakening economic conditions, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate from 4.5 percent at the end of 2007 to 2 percent at the beginning of September 2008. As the financial crisis and the economic contraction intensified in the fall of 2008, the FOMC accelerated its interest rate cuts, taking the rate to its effective floor—a target range of 0 to 25 basis points—by the end of the year. In November 2008, the Federal Reserve also initiated the first in a series of large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs, buying mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury securities. These purchases were intended to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates and improve financial conditions more broadly, thereby supporting economic activity (Bernanke 2012).\nThe recession ended in June 2009, but economic weakness persisted. Economic growth was only moderate—averaging about 2 percent in the first four years of the recovery—and the unemployment rate, particularly the rate of long-term unemployment, remained at historically elevated levels. In the face of this prolonged weakness, the Federal Reserve maintained an exceptionally low level for the federal funds rate target and sought new ways to provide additional monetary accommodation. These included additional LSAP programs, known more popularly as quantitative easing, or QE. The FOMC also began communicating its intentions for future policy settings more explicitly in its public statements, particularly the circumstances under which exceptionally low interest rates were likely to be appropriate. For example, in December 2012, the committee stated that it anticipates that exceptionally low interest rates would likely remain appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate was above a threshold value of 6.5 percent and inflation was expected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. This strategy, known as \"forward guidance,\" was intended to convince the public that rates would stay low at least until certain economic conditions were met, thereby putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.\nEffects on Financial Regulation\nWhen the financial market turmoil had subsided, attention naturally turned to reforms to the financial sector and its supervision and regulation, motivated by a desire to avoid similar events in the future. A number of measures have been proposed or put in place to reduce the risk of financial distress. For traditional banks, there are significant increases in the amount of required capital overall, with larger increases for so-called \"systemically important\" institutions (Bank for International Settlements 2011a; 2011b). Liquidity standards will for the first time formally limit the amount of banks' maturity transformation (Bank for International Settlements 2013). Regular stress testing will help both banks and regulators understand risks and will force banks to use earnings to build capital instead of paying dividends as conditions deteriorate (Board of Governors 2011).\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 also created new provisions for the treatment of large financial institutions. For example, the Financial Stability Oversight Council has the authority to designate nontraditional credit intermediaries \"Systemically Important Financial Institutions\" (SIFIs), which subjects them to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. The act also created the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), which allows the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to wind down certain institutions when the firm's failure is expected to pose a great risk to the financial system. Another provision of the act requires large financial institutions to create \"living wills,\" which are detailed plans laying out how the institution could be resolved under US bankruptcy code without jeopardizing the rest of the financial system or requiring government support.\nLike the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Inflation of the 1970s, the financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing recession are vital areas of study for economists and policymakers. While it may be many years before the causes and consequences of these events are fully understood, the effort to untangle them is an important opportunity for the Federal Reserve and other agencies to learn lessons that can inform future policy.\nEndnotes\n- 1 Many of these actions were taken under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which at that time authorized lending to individuals, partnerships, and corporations in \"unusual and exigent\" circumstances and subject to other restrictions.

Rick Perry tonight declared to the American people his unshakeable commitment to get America working again as the next president of the United States. He shared his record of success in Texas as well as his plans to turn the country's economy around during the Reagan Centennial GOP Candidates Debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum.\n\"I am pleased to have been able to introduce my conservative philosophy and pro-jobs record to the American people watching this important debate,\" said Gov. Rick Perry. \"We must not allow four more years of the current administration's devastating economic policies. What I've accomplished in one state, I pledge to do for the entire country — to create a job-friendly environment, protect our border and citizens, provide essential services — and then get government out of the way.\"\nDuring the debate, Gov. Perry highlighted his record of successfully creating a job-friendly environment in Texas, which continues to lead the nation in job creation. As governor, Perry has worked hard to keep taxes low, maintain a predictable regulatory environment, prevent frivolous lawsuits, and prioritize public education, all aimed at creating America's top economy and job-producing state.\nTexas has created more than one million net new jobs under Gov. Perry and is home to approximately 40 percent of all net new jobs in America since June 2009. Gov. Perry is a proven fiscal conservative, having cut taxes, signed six balanced budgets, and led Texas to become America's top job-creating state. He is the only Texas governor since World War II to cut state general revenue spending.\nOf all the candidates, including President Obama, Gov. Perry has the best record of job creation and has fought to defend and strengthen measures that have maintained a competitive economy, even during a national recession. Gov. Perry's record exceeds other candidates' rhetoric when it comes to job creation.\n\"I have a simple yet proven strategy, and I will get America working again as the next president of the United States. I will take decisive action to foster an environment for job creation and turn this great nation back into the land of opportunity.\"\nFor information setting the record straight about various statements made during the debate, please visit: http://www.rickperry.org/reagan-debate-recap/ or follow @PerryTruthTeam on Twitter.\nRick Perry, Perry Campaign Press Release - Gov.

Inhofe, who has said that global warming is the biggest hoax ever perpetrated, says he's going to tell the participants in the Copenhagen talks that there will not be serious action to address climate change in America.\nHe is entitled to his opinion, but he is not entitled to his own facts.\nI am here to set the record straight. America has already acted. We continue to act. And we are doing more every day.\nII. STATE AND LOCAL ACTION\nLet's look at my home state of California. If it were a separate country, it would be the world's seventh or eighth largest economy. A 2006 law requires action to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.\nLast month, the California Air Resources Board produced its first cap-and-trade blueprint, which would cap global warming pollution for about 600 of the largest emitters in the state. The plan includes offsets and other measures to ensure a smooth transition to a clean energy economy.\nAll together, 33 states - accounting for two-thirds of the U.S. population -- are embracing action as part of regional or state-based cap-and-trade emissions-reduction programs.\nA new report out last week shows that these state-level actions could cut the nation's CO2 output by 536 million metric tons by 2020. That's the equivalent of 7 percent of our country's greenhouse gases produced in 2005.\nThe ten Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) have already held six auctions for carbon allowances, and 233 power plants are buying and selling pollution permits under an existing, operating cap-and-trade program.\nIf you look a little further to our north and west, another six states have formed the Midwest Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, and are developing their own cap and trade system.\nIn the western states, the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) - comprised of seven U.S. states, including my home state of California, and four Canadian provinces -- recently announced its recommendations for the design of a regional market-based cap-and-trade program.\nIn the Southeast, Charlie Crist, the Republican governor, signed a law last year authorizing the Florida's Department of Environmental Protection to develop a cap-and-trade program for emissions from electric utilities.\nThe actions taken by states are powerful evidence that our states are committed to participating in the clean energy transformation - and in the jobs and economic opportunities that come with it.\nOur nation's cities are also taking action to cut emissions, reduce energy consumption. On October 2, the 1000th mayor signed the Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement, pledging to reduce his communities' carbon emissions 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.\nCalifornia is a leader in this wave of local action, too, with 135 mayors in my state taking part. In communities across the country, cities are turning their municipal fleets toward alternative fuels or hybrid power, making city buildings more sustainable, employing cleaner energy sources for power plants.\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Villaraigosa has set a goal of 40 percent renewable energy for the city's water and power department by 2020, and the city aims to make its power generation entirely coal-free by then.\nThe programs our cities are putting in place are cutting global warming pollution and boosting clean energy demand right now. These are real changes that are already underway.\nIII. THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS ACTING\nBusiness executives from leading American companies are also demanding we take action - now -- to unleash the marketplace for clean energy technology.\nLast month, Dow Chemical Company's vice president for government affairs said legislation that puts a price on carbon gives companies like his predictability to invest in new technologies that otherwise would not be viable, like manufacturing solar shingles or using CO2 to create fuel with algae.\nThe sooner we act, the better.\nThe Vice Chairman of GE testified before the EPW Committee that clean energy could become the dominant job creator of the 21st Century. He said, \"Companies and countries that move quickly to seize that opportunity will reap the rewards going forward.\"\nWe know that clean energy is a proven job creator.\nThe latest economic study at the University of California at Berkeley predicts up to 1.9 million new jobs in America from a comprehensive clean energy bill. And once again, my state is demonstrating that these jobs are real.\nClean energy and energy efficiency jobs continue to be one of the bright spots in the California economy. On December 9th, the Los Angeles Times reported an analysis released by Collaborative Economics for the Next 10 organization that found green jobs increased by 5 percent -- while total jobs declined by 1 percent -- in California from January 2007 to January 2008. The study also found that between 1995 and 2008, green jobs grew at three times the rate of the overall California economy.\nThe Pew Charitable Trust reports that 10,000 new clean energy businesses were launched in California from 1998 to 2007. During that period, clean energy investments created more than 125,000 jobs and generated jobs 15 percent faster than the California economy as a whole.\nThese are solid, steady, good wage-paying jobs.\nI'm talking about manufacturing jobs for steel workers and machinists, transportation jobs for truckers and rail workers, high-tech jobs for electrical engineers and software designers. Jobs building and installing solar panels on houses here in the U.S. can't be outsourced to other countries.\nWe have a choice. We can create jobs here by putting in place the policies that drive innovation. That is the best way to ensure that we do not stand by and watch as other countries create them overseas.\nBy 2020, the global clean energy market is estimated to reach $500 billion, some two and a half times the size of the global personal computer market. A Bloomberg News report this month found that clean energy is already estimated to draw $200 billion in investments worldwide in 2010.\nIV. FEDERAL ACTION IS HAPPENING NOW\nLast week marked an important milestone in the effort to address the challenge of global warming: The EPA found that global warming presents a danger to our people and our environment.\nThe endangerment finding that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson released reflects the hard work of experts in both Republican and Democratic administrations.\nThe Obama Administration has done the right thing for the nation, for the planet, and - if you listen to our business community -- for the economy.\nThe endangerment finding will set the stage for EPA regulations to curb global warming pollution from vehicles, and also makes it possible to address emissions from new and expanded power plants.\nEPA has a crucial role to play in getting the process started. The Clean Air Act provides EPA with powerful tools for addressing greenhouse gases, and the Supreme Court found it is their responsibility.\nThe endangerment finding itself is clear: \"The Administrator finds that six greenhouse gases taken in combination endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.\"\nThe finding cites dangers to public health from \"changes in air quality, increases in temperatures, changes in extreme weather events, increases in food- and water-borne pathogens...\" Threats to public welfare include \"...numerous and far-ranging risks to food production and agriculture, forestry, water resources, sea level rise and coastal areas, energy, infrastructure ... and ecosystems and wildlife.\"\nIn September, EPA finalized its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, which will, for the first time, require large emitters of heat-trapping emissions to begin collecting greenhouse gas (GHG) data under a new reporting system.\nFollowing through on a plan announced in May 2009, the Obama Administration proposed rules in September that would set nationwide limits on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and require a nearly 40 percent increase in fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks sold in the United States by 2016.\nV: CONGRESS IS MOVING FORWARD\nAnd Congress has taken important steps, too.\nIn February, we approved tens of billions of dollars for clean energy funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which included over $58 billion in funding for important clean energy priorities.\nThe Recovery Act includes funds for hands-on training for jobs installing solar panels, maintaining electric vehicles, and researching fuel cell technologies and putting people to work boosting the energy efficiency homes across America.\nJust last week, Sapphire Energy -- a San Diego company using algae to convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into renewable fuels -- received more than $100 million in grants and loan guarantees through the Recovery Act. Those funds will allow Sapphire to create hundreds of jobs and expand their commercial scale facilities in New Mexico and advance their research activities in San Diego.\nThe House has also acted on a comprehensive plan -- On June 26, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, by a vote of 219 to 212.\nIn June, the Senate Energy Committee passed S. 1462, the American Clean Energy Leadership Act (ACELA).\nAnd on November 5, 2009: The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act.\nOur bill is a road map to avoiding the most dangerous impacts of global warming, getting us off our $1 billion a day foreign oil habit, creating millions of new jobs and ensuring the United States is a leader in the clean energy economy.\nThe Kerry Boxer bill addresses major challenges of our generation:\n• Creating the policies that will lead to millions of new jobs here in America;\n• Putting America back in control of our energy future;\n• Making our nation more secure and less dependent on foreign oil; and\n• Protecting our children and the earth from dangerous pollution.\nProvisions of the Kerry-Boxer bill and the Energy Committee's bill now will become part of a comprehensive clean energy and climate package for consideration by the full Senate. Majority Leader Reid is working with the chairmen of six committees (EPW, Energy, Commerce, Foreign Relations, Finance, and Agriculture) to craft a package for floor consideration.\nSenators Kerry, Lieberman and Graham are hard at work building the bipartisan consensus that will be needed to pass comprehensive clean energy legislation. They announced the broad parameters of their bill, and they are dedicated to getting the votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate.\nSenator Cantwell introduced a bill with Senator Collins, which I believe is a positive development, because the more Senators involved in discussing the issue, the better.\nI was deeply moved by the recent statement of Senator Robert C. Byrd about the importance of working together to develop clean energy legislation that works for all regions of the country.\n\"To be part of any solution, one must first acknowledge a problem. To deny the mounting science of climate change is to stick our heads in the sand and say \"deal me out.\" West Virginia would be much smarter to stay at the table.\"\nSenator Byrd is right. We all need to stay at the table and find the answers, together. Solutions that will benefit West Virginia. Solutions that will benefit California. Solutions that create jobs for workers across the nation and protect children from coast to coast from pollution.\nThe need for action is urgent.\nVI. THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR\nThe world's leading scientists continue to tell us that we must reduce carbon pollution now to avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change. And they continue to reaffirm those warnings despite the latest attempts by those opposed to action to undermine the public's confidence.\nJust last week, a letter from 25 of America's most preeminent scientific experts - including 8 members of the National Academy of Sciences - wrote to Congress to underscore the need for urgent action to reduce global warming pollution.\nHere's what they wrote --\n\"We would like to set the record straight. The body of evidence that human activity is the dominant cause of global warming is overwhelming. The content of the stolen emails has no impact whatsoever on our overall understanding that human activity is driving dangerous levels of global warming.\"\nAnd on Friday, December 4, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has reaffirmed the position of its Board of Directors and the leaders of 18 respected organizations, who concluded based on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now underway, and it is a growing threat to society.\n\"The vast preponderance of evidence, based on years of research conducted by a wide array of different investigators at many institutions, clearly indicates that global climate change is real, it is caused largely by human activities, and the need to take action is urgent,\" said Alan I. Leshner, chief executive officer of AAAS and executive publisher of the journal Science.\nI believe the recent focus on stolen emails from a British university has further focused attention on global warming.\nNothing that we have seen to date on the stolen emails contradicts the overwhelming body of scientific work, which shows that global warming caused by human activity is real and serious. The Associated Press investigation of the emails found the same thing. More than anything, the emails reflect the intensity of feelings on both sides associated with the debate between the dissenters, and the vast majority of leading experts.\nUnfortunately this debate got personalized by both sides.\nFor a long time the dissenters have used emotional language to characterize the scientists and others who have called for action on global warming. Earlier this year, Senator Inhofe called business leaders who support action on climate change, \"a few corporate prostitutes.\" The website JunkScience.com called them \"carbon criminals\" and put their faces on ‘Wanted' posters. [CHART]\nWell, some scientist reacted in kind. Here's an example. [CHART]\nIt is unfortunate that personal animosity entered this debate, but we must listen to what the science is telling us.\nThe science is clear, the challenge is real, and the time to act is now.\nA recent commentary on public radio a few days ago on the Copenhagen talks summed up the key points. Fred Fiske is a long-standing commentator with public radio.\nThe threat posed by global warming is serious - \"rising sea levels, drought, disease, collapsing agriculture, and mass population migrations\" are just some of what we are facing if we do not act. American business leaders know we need to act now - a company like Coca Cola, which relies on reliable local supplies of clean water, \"is deeply concerned with the problem of water scarcity.\"\nAnd finally the urgency of action is undeniable: \"Reaching consensus - nationally, regionally, and globally - will not be easy. But if we are at all concerned with the habitability of the planet which we will bequeath to future generations, we must move forward.\"\nVII. CONCLUSION\nTwo weeks ago, the President sent a strong signal to the world that this nation is serious about working with the international community when he proposed a U.S. target in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. The EPW Committee passed a 20 percent target, and the House passed a 17 percent cut, so the President's proposal is certainly credible and realistic, because it reflects the work of both Houses of Congress.\nAnd I was pleased to see that the President plans to be in Copenhagen this week, with nearly 100 other heads of state, to participate in the crucial final stages of the negotiations.\nOur nation will be a full participant in crafting a global solution to this global challenge.\nIt is easy to say, \"No.\" But I believe that would be missing a huge opportunity to launch a strong economic rebound and save our planet for our children and grandchildren.\nWe didn't ask for this challenge. But it is here, and we have a responsibility to face it.\nAnd the best part is this: clean energy legislation will move us away from foreign oil and the billion dollars a day we pay for it, and it will lead us into a strong economic recovery and long term prosperity for our nation.\n###\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

For 11 years, beginning in 1978, Onion Creek Club conducted the celebrated Legends tournament, as the course designed by Jimmy Demaret and founded by legendary Texas amateur Jimmie Connolly in 1974 more than held its own against the great golfers of that period.\nAn additional nine holes, fashioned by Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore, were put into play on higher ground in 1996. It's those nine holes that were first playable after the flood. Nine holes from the original course are being repaired now and the club expects them to be open (under \"winter golf\" conditions) by January 1.\nOnce the Waters Subsided,\nPiles of Debris and Trees were Everywhere.\nIt will take considerably longer to rebuild the front nine of the original course, which is set in the lowest part of the property.\nIt's hard to believe or even fathom the devastation to the course and surrounding neighborhood created by the raging waters that, at one point, saw Onion Creek rise 11 feet in 15 minutes. On October 31 (on the morning after 18 inches of rain pelted southeast Austin) the creek's flow rate was 120,000-cubic feet per second. That's nearly double the average flow of Niagara Falls.\nOnion Creek crested at the highest it's been in 92 years, and reached dozens of homes in the neighborhood, including a line of houses across the street from the creek and 80 yards across the fairway of the third hole.\nRaging Onion Creek Flowed at Twice\nthe Rate of Niagara Falls\nOnion Creek Club's original 18 holes were built on a floodplain of the burgeoning neighborhood some 15 minutes southeast of Austin's downtown sector. The club and community have endured floods in the past; in both 1998 and 2001 the creek overflowed and destroyed parts of the course. But the water had never before damaged the homes and property above the course.\n\"I was called to the club at about 6:30 in the morning and when I got here the water was over some of the road bridges,\" said Justin Jafarian, Onion Creek Club's general manager. \"Some houses had four feet of water in them and people just didn't know what to do or how that happened.\"\nPreliminary estimates place damages to the course at about $5 million. The club also lost its course-maintenance equipment when the building where it is housed was swamped with four feet of water; to get to that structure, the rising creek had to cross a huge grass berm constructed to keep water away after the 2001 flood.\nThe Flood Swept a Truck into Onion Creek\nAfter enduring several years of drought conditions, October of 2013 was the wettest October on record in Austin. In fact, a smaller flash flood October 12 ripped up several of the course's greens, knocked down some trees and destroyed all the bunkers on the low-lying holes. When the rains came on the night of October 30, conditions were ripe for a disaster.\nAs the rain poured in buckets, the water continued to rise and move with alarming speed. A dozen putting surfaces were scraped down to sub-turf level, exposing irrigation pipes and electrical wires. Trees were felled and swept away - a 70-foot-tall oak that once stood to the left of the sixth green was uprooted and rolled down the fairway of the adjacent par-5 seventh, tumbling some 700 yards before becoming lodged against another huge oak.\nA cement and shell barrier encased in chicken wire and weighing tons that was built to protect the fourth tee was twisted and rolled like a wet dishrag - but it did its job, the tee remains intact.\nA cement dam between the creek and pond that fronts the par-3 11th hole on the original course was breeched and left with a huge sinkhole.\nThe 15th Green on the Crenshaw Nine\nBut the amount of water that flowed into the valley that forms the course's signature hole - the downhill par-4 12th, with a drop of 50 feet from tee to fairway - was almost incomprehensible. Looking out from the tee of the par-3 17th, which also sits high above the valley that forms the 12th, all one could see was a lake of water; the 12th green was covered by at least 20 feet of floodwater.\nOnion Creek Club, owned and operated by the Dominion Golf Group, has more than 800 members, about half of which enjoy golfing privileges. Jafarian said that about 70 percent of the membership resides in the adjoining neighborhood.\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, the club was the focal point of a community recovery effort. Local grocery stores provided volunteers to help residents clean up their flooded homes and an area restaurant donated food to feed those affected by the flood and the volunteers.\n\"Our focus for the first few days was making sure everyone was safe and cared for and that those affected had someplace they could go for help,\" Jafarian said. \"This community pulled together to help their neighbors; we just gave people a central place to come to get the aid that was offered.\"\nThe 12th Hole (Foreground)\nand the 16th Green Pre-Flood\nThe club's driving range was available for use just two days after the flood and the golf professionals have been conducting lessons and seminars, trying to make the best out of a bad situation. Members have been granted playing privileges at several area clubs as well as the Dominion Golf Group's sister clubs, two of which (River Place CC and Twin Creeks CC) are in the Austin area.\n\"We are determined to get back to normalcy as quickly as possible, and the grounds-keeping crew has been working dawn to dusk to clean up the course and get our members back out on the course,\" said John Ferguson, Onion Creek's director of golf.\nSince Demaret, Connally and their pal Bing Crosby first sent a golf ball rocketing down the No. 1 fairway, Onion Creek has held a special place in golf history.

Another 8.5 (million) rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each.\n        Subject(s): health-care\n        Speaker: barack-obama\n        Speaker's Job Title: President\n        State Info: Illinois\n        Party Affiliation: democrat\n        Barely-True: 70\n        False: 71\n        Half-True: 160\n        Mostly-True: 163\n        Pants-Fire: 9\n        Context: a speech at the White House\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        WASHINGTON (AP) — Another year, another round of exaggeration from President Barack Obama and his administration about health insurance rebates.\nIn his speech defending his health care law Thursday, Obama said rebates averaging $100 are coming from insurance companies to 8.5 million Americans. In fact, most of the money is going straight to employers who provide health insurance, not to their workers, who benefit indirectly.\nObama danced around that reality in remarks that also blamed problems in establishing affordable insurance markets on political opponents, glossing over complex obstacles also faced in states that support the law.\nA look at some of his claims and how they compare with the facts:\n—”Last year, millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies. But instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill, they were pleasantly surprised with a check. In 2012, 13 million rebates went out, in all 50 states. Another 8.5 (million) rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each.”\n— After introducing several people who got rebate checks last year: “And this is happening all across the country. And it’s happening because of the Affordable Care Act. Hasn’t been reported on a lot. I bet if you took a poll, most folks wouldn’t know when that check comes in that this was because of Obamacare that they got this extra money in their pockets. But that’s what’s happening.”\n—” If they’re (insurers) not spending your premium dollars on your health care — at least 80 percent of it — they’ve got to give you some money back.”\nTHE FACTS: Just as he did a year ago, Obama made a splashy announcement about rebates that incorporates misleading advertising.\nThe health care law requires insurance companies that spend too much on administrative expenses to issue rebates to customers. But those customers are often employers that in turn offer insurance to workers and bear the bulk of the costs. In workplace plans, the rebate goes to the employer, which must use it for the company health plan but does not have to pass all or part of it on to the worker. People who buy their own insurance and qualify for a rebate get it directly.\nObama was on solid ground in saying “millions of Americans” got rebate checks last year, but the number was not close to 13 million as he implied.\nOf the 12.8 million rebates announced last year, health policy experts estimated 3 million would go directly to the insured. The government didn’t know how many.\nNearly two-thirds of the 12.8 million were only entitled to pro-rated and decidedly modest rebates, because they were covered by employers that pay most of their premiums. Workers typically pay about 20 percent of the premium for single coverage, 30 percent for a family plan. Employers pay the rest.\nAnd employers can use all the rebate money, including the workers’ share, to benefit the company health plan, perhaps restraining premiums a bit or otherwise improving the bottom line. The law requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premiums they collect on medical care and quality improvement, or return the difference to consumers and employers.\nAltogether, this year’s rebates are worth $500 million, down from $1.1 billion returned last year. The government says the lower rebates mean insurance companies are becoming more efficient.\n—”I’m curious, what do opponents of this law think the folks here today should do with the money they were reimbursed? Should they send it back to the insurance companies?”\nTHE FACTS: Even in that unlikely event, most people could not send it back to insurance companies because the money doesn’t go “in their pockets” and they have no control over what their employers do with it.\n—”In states that are working hard to make sure this law delivers for their people, what we’re seeing is that consumers are getting a hint of how much money they’re potentially going to save because of this law. In states like California, Oregon, Washington, new competition, new choices, market forces are pushing costs down.”\nTHE FACTS: It is simply not known whether health insurance will become less expensive in those states — or nationally — than it is now, or than it would have been absent the law. And hitches in setting up the new insurance marketplaces called exchanges are not limited to Republican-led states where leaders object to the law, although that political pushback is certainly part of what’s going on.\nIn California, for example, where there is plenty of competition by health insurers wanting to get into the exchange, an actuarial report commissioned by Covered California, the state agency running the insurance marketplace, found that middle-income residents could see individual health premiums increase by an average of 30 percent while costs go down for lower income people.\nIn West Virginia, Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin — also a cooperative partner in expanding Medicaid and setting up an exchange — complained to federal officials this week about delays in rules and guidelines from Washington as the state struggles to meet deadlines under the law.\n“Many West Virginia families have expressed frustration” trying to find out how much policies from the exchange will cost them and whether they will get a subsidy, he said, and the state is “dangerously close” to falling short of requirements under the law.\n###\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Did you know that 8.5 million Americans are getting a refund this year from their health insurance companies?\nThanks to a provision in the Affordable Care Act, if your insurance company isn’t spending at least 80 percent of your premium dollars on medical care, they have to send you some money back.\nToday in the East Room, President Obama explained that “last year, millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies -- but instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill they were pleasantly surprised with a check. In 2012, 13 million rebates went out, in all 50 states.\" Another 8.5 million rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around $100 each, he said.\nMorgan, a woman from Maryland who has been purchasing her own health insurance for many years, introduced the President today. She said that after she got a rebate for the first time, “it felt like someone was actually being held accountable for the dollars I was spending on health care.”\nThat’s one of core principles of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama said today – “holding insurance companies and providers accountable so that we all get a better deal.”\nSo that’s just one way this law is helping middle-class families. But it represents everything the Affordable Care Act means for folks who already have insurance: better benefits, stronger protections, more bang for your buck -- the basic notion that you ought to get what you pay for.\nLearn more about how the Affordable Care Act is saving Americans billions of dollars.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Summary\nWe’ve been batting down bogus claims about the Affordable Care Act for years, since 2009, when legislation was still in the debate stage. But they’ve been increasing in intensity in recent months as we approach Oct. 1, the date the insurance exchanges will be open for business for those buying their own insurance, mainly with the help of federal subsidies.\nSo, more than three years after our last health-care-whoppers piece (published just before the law was signed in 2010), we’re giving readers a rundown of the top claims.\nSome have been around for years, and others are relatively new. Most touch on three topics: jobs, premium costs and medical care. For instance:\n- Republicans have made the overblown claim that the law is a job-killer, but experts predict a small impact on mainly low-wage jobs. The Republican National Committee says 8.2 million part-timers can’t find full-time work “partly” due to the law. That’s the total number of part-time workers who want full-time jobs, and there’s no evidence from official jobs figures that the law has had an impact.\n- Proponents say premiums will go down, while opponents say they’ll go up. In general, employer plans won’t be affected much, and a price change for individuals seeking their own insurance will vary from person to person. Obama claimed that all of the uninsured would see lower premiums than what they could get now (before accounting for federal subsidies), but that’s not the case.\n- Critics continue to make scary claims about the government coming between you and your doctor, but the law doesn’t set up a government-run system. If anything, the law comes between you and your insurance company, forbidding them from capping your coverage or charging you more based on health status. Meanwhile, Obama can’t promise you can keep your plan. Employers are free to switch coverage, just as they were before.\nAnd there’s more. Since 2010, we’ve been debunking the persistent claim that members of Congress are somehow exempt from the law. They’re not. The administration’s recent decision to give exchanges leeway in how they verify suspect applications for subsidies sparked the false claim that Americans can list what they’d like for their incomes and won’t face verification.\nBeyond these more reasonable topics, we’ve seen our share of far-fetched viral messages about microchips being implanted in patients and forced home inspections by the government. Rest assured. Neither is true.\nAnalysis\nThe law is long, complicated and still being implemented. Many of the claims we’ve seen — and expect to see for some time to come — center on the impact on employers (or employees), premium rates and medical decisions.\nJobs\nClaim: 8.2 million Americans can’t find full-time work partly due to Obamacare.\nFactCheck.org says: False.\nThis assertion from the Republican National Committee echoes others conservative claims that the law is hindering part-timers from finding full-time jobs. But the RNC’s 8.2 million figure was the total number in June of part-time workers in the U.S. seeking full-time work — what the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls “part-time for economic reasons” — and there’s no evidence from BLS numbers that the law has had an impact on such workers. There were more in this “part-time for economic reasons” category in March 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law (9.1 million). The latest figure, from August, is 7.9 million.\nThe law requires employers with 50 or more full-time employees to provide insurance or pay a fine. (This provision was delayed until 2015.) Full-time is defined as 30 hours per week. These details have fueled Republican claims that the law will cause — or is causing — employers to reduce their employees’ hours to get under the 30-hour/50-employee thresholds. It’s certainly possible that some employers will try to get by with fewer workers, or fewer worker-hours. And some among millions of part-timers seeking full-time work may have had their hours cut. But we can’t say how many that would be, and neither can the RNC.\nTo be sure, there have been plenty of news reports of employers, particularly those, like retail stores or restaurants, with low-wage employees, saying they’re concerned and uncertain about the impact of the law, and they might cut hours or workers on their payrolls. We can’t predict what companies might do once the employer requirements take effect.\nWhile the BLS numbers don’t show an impact on part-time workers seeking full-time work, there is some anecdotal evidence of employers cutting the hours of part-time workers to get or keep them under a 30-hour-a-week limit. The Washington Post, for instance, wrote about the state of Virginia implementing such a cap on the hours of part-timers, like adjunct faculty at Northern Virginia Community College. And other colleges have instituted such limits, according to press reports. These employers have not indicated in the news reports whether they would be hiring additional workers, or increasing the hours of others, to fill in the gaps.\n“ObamaCare by the Numbers,” Aug. 2\nClaim: The law is a job-killer.\nFactCheck.org says: Overblown.\nIt’s true nonpartisan economic analyses have estimated a “small” loss of mainly low-wage jobs because of the law. But as one expert told us, there hasn’t been much analysis of this impact of the law because, he believes, economists think the impact will be minimal. Still, Republicans have continued to push the idea that the law will have a significant effect on jobs.\nThis claim made our “Whoppers of 2011” list, and it has continued to be pushed in various forms — with the latest being the claims about part-time work. Mainly, the “job-killer” claims severely distort a 2010 nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office report that said the law would have a “small” impact on jobs. And that’s mainly from workers choosing to work less. For instance, some might work fewer hours if they receive subsidies to help them buy insurance, or those close to retirement may retire early, with some reassurance that they can buy insurance on their own.\nThe CBO report said this decrease in the amount of labor in the economy would amount to one-half of 1 percent, which Republicans quickly translated into a loss of actual jobs. But, as we said, CBO clearly explained this would come about “primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply.”\nCBO did say, however, that the employer requirements to provide insurance or pay a fine “will probably cause some employers to respond by hiring fewer low-wage workers.” But they may hire more part-time or seasonal workers instead. CBO hasn’t put a number on these jobs.\nOther experts we’ve consulted have predicted a minimal impact. The Lewin Group, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group that operates independently of the company, estimated a 150,000 to 300,000 job loss of minimum wage or near minimum wage positions. Not included is an unknown increase in jobs in health care and insurance. Altogether, Lewin’s then-senior vice president told us there would be a “small net job loss.”\nIn July, claims about the law killing jobs took the form of a “mis-tweet” from several congressional Republicans, who wrongly tweeted “74% of small businesses will fire workers, cut hours under #Obamacare.” But the online, opt-in survey from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the law, found no more than 13 percent of the small businesses that responded said that. During the presidential campaign, Republican nominee Mitt Romney cited an earlier survey from the group to bolster his claims.\n“GOP Mistweets #Obamacare Survey Results,” July 25\n“Romney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods,” June 28, 2012\n“GOP’s ‘Job-Killing’ Whopper, Again,” Feb. 21, 2012\n“The Whoppers of 2011,” Dec. 20, 2011\nPremiums\nClaim: Premiums are going up because of the law. Premiums are going down because of the law.\nFactCheck.org says: It depends.\nPoliticians have been making these claims since before the law was passed — it was the first item on our list of whoppers back in 2010. Both sides have a penchant for misrepresenting studies on the matter to support their point. Our short answer — “it depends” — may be unsatisfactory to readers, but whether you’ll pay more or less than you would have without the law depends on your circumstances.\nAre you uninsured and have a preexisting condition? You’ll likely pay less than you would have otherwise. Are you uninsured but young and healthy? You’ll likely pay more (without accounting for any subsidies you may receive). Are you insured through your employer? You likely won’t see much change either way.\nLet’s start with employer-sponsored insurance. Employer-sponsored premiums did go up slightly due to the law from 2010 to 2011 (a 1 percent to 3 percent increase, according to experts), because of added benefits, such as coverage for dependents up to age 26, free preventive care and an increase in caps on coverage. Overall, premiums for family plans jumped 9 percent that year, with the bulk of that due to higher medical costs, not, as critics claimed, the health care law. Since then, premium growth has been 4 percent on average for 2012 and 2013, modest growth rates historically.\nNote that premiums have been going up for years and will continue to do so — with or without the health care law. When Democrats make claims about premiums going down, they’re talking about premiums growing at a lower rate than they would have otherwise.\nThe growth in national health spending (that’s spending from the government, businesses and individuals) from 2009 to 2011 also has been at around 4 percent, the lowest level since such spending was first measured in 1960. President Obama has boasted that the ACA has helped make this happen. It could be playing some role, with an emphasis on new payment models, but experts say the cause is mainly the down economy. A Kaiser Family Foundation study said the economy was responsible for 77 percent of the slow growth rate, and that rate is expected to pick up as the economy recovers.\nNow, the big question mark is for those who buy their own insurance. We’ll know more in October, when the state and federal exchanges have published rates and are accepting applications. But even then, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to make generalizations. Some folks will pay more, some will pay less, than what they would have otherwise. Many who had purchased on the individual market in the past will get more generous benefits — which will be good news for some and irrelevant to others. And the vast majority buying their own exchange plans — 80 percent, according to the CBO — will receive subsidies that bring their total out-of-pocket costs down.\nThese plans sold to individuals can no longer charge more based on health status or gender, but they can vary premiums based on geography, age and tobacco use. Republicans have warned of a “rate shock” in this market, with the young and healthy being subject to higher premiums if the market is flooded with older and less healthy policyholders. A RAND study, published in August and sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, estimated there would be “no widespread trend toward sharply higher prices in the individual market,” in the words of the lead author. But rates would likely vary from state to state.\nThe research group looked at 10 states and the U.S. overall, estimating no premium change for the U.S. at large and five states, a decline in two states, and an increase up to 43 percent in three states, not accounting for tax credits. The study, which held age, tobacco use and actuarial value (level of coverage) constant in comparisons, said average out-of-pocket costs would be unchanged or decline for all states once tax credits are factored in.\nBut that’s one estimate from an economic model, with noted “limitations.” Says the RAND study: “Current data on nongroup premiums are limited, and there are many uncertainties about how individuals and insurers will respond to the complex policy changes introduced by the Affordable Care Act.” It cautions against “sweeping statements” about the impact on premiums, since rates will differ based on individual circumstances.\nThat brings us back to our short answer: It depends.\n“False Assumptions on the Health Care Law,” July 11\n“Obama Overhypes Health Savings,” July 19\n“Health Insurance Premium Spin,” April 5\n” ‘Obamacare’ to cost $20,000 a Family?” March 1\nClaim: All of the uninsured will pay less on the exchanges than they could now on the individual market, even without federal subsidies.\nFactCheck.org says: False.\nPresident Obama made this claim at an Aug. 9 press conference, saying that beginning Oct. 1, the 15 percent of the population that’s uninsured would be able to “sign up for affordable quality health insurance at a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market.” Obama went on to emphasize that that was before including federal subsidies. “And if even with lower premiums they still can’t afford it, we’re going to be able to provide them with a tax credit to help them buy it,” he added.\nBut even Obama’s secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, has acknowledged that young persons would likely pay more and older Americans would likely pay less on the insurance exchanges. As we explained, the reason is that the ACA changes how insurance companies can price these policies on the individual market — it forbids insurance companies from charging more for persons with preexisting conditions or based on gender, and limits them to charging older policyholders no more than three times what they charge to younger policyholders. Premiums can also vary based on geography and smoking — but smokers can only be charged 1.5 times the rate for nonsmokers.\nThere won’t be any super-cheap plans for the young and healthy, nor sky-high premiums for older folks or those with health conditions. (High-deductible catastrophic plans, however, will be available to those under 30, or older Americans with hardship exemptions. They can be purchased only without federal subsidies.) Some on the exchanges will pay less; some will pay more than what they could get now. Economist Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was a paid adviser to both the Obama administration and then-Gov. Mitt Romney’s administration on health care plans. Gruber told us a “small share” of the uninsured would pay higher premiums on the exchanges. “The president is right for the average uninsured person, but not for all uninsured people,” he said.\nThat’s before subsidies, of course. Only 10 percent of the uninsured earn too much to qualify for federal subsidies on the exchanges, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. But Obama claimed they’d pay less even without the federal help.\n“Obama Overpromises on Premiums,” Aug. 13\nClaim: 8.5 million Americans will receive rebates this year averaging about $100 each because of the health care law.\nFactCheck.org says: Misleading.\nPresident Obama has stretched the facts in making this boast about the law’s impact. The rebates are real, but most of them will go to companies offering insurance to their workers. Only those who buy their own insurance will get a rebate check directly. And the $100 is an average per family, not per person.\nThe law requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on health costs — as opposed to spending on administration and marketing, and, of course, profit. If companies don’t meet the 80/20 ratio, they have to issue a rebate to consumers. Large group plans have to meet an 85/15 ratio. In 2012 and again in 2013 rebates were sent out, but Obama has pitched this as Americans receiving checks in the mail. This year, in a July 18 speech, he talked about “millions of Americans” opening letters from their insurers and being “pleasantly surprised with a check. In 2012, 13 million rebates went out, in all 50 states. Another 8.5 [million] rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each.”\nBut most of the money went directly to employers who provided the policies to their workers. Of the 8.5 million benefiting from this provision in 2013, 2.7 million are on the individual market, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, meaning the rebate would go directly to them. In 2012, 4 million of the 13 million benefiting were on the individual market. Those with employer plans could still see a benefit, as savings are passed along in some way to them. But, as the Department of Labor, which spells out in its guidance on the matter, says, employers who pay part of the premium are entitled to part of the rebate.\n“Obama Overhypes Health Savings,” July 19\n“Romney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods,” June 28, 2012\nMedical Care\nClaim: You won’t be able to choose your own doctor.\nClaim: The government will be between you and your doctor.\nFactCheck.org says: False.\nThese claims are variations on the fear that the government will be taking over health care — choosing your doctor, telling him or her what treatment to administer, etc. But the law doesn’t create a government-run system, as we’ve said many times. It actually greatly expands business for private insurance, by about 12 million new customers, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. And individuals will choose their own doctors, just as they do now.\nThese type of fear-mongering claims appear to have quieted a bit in 2013 — along with the more extreme death-panel-type hysteria — but they’re still percolating. A TV ad this summer from the conservative Americans for Prosperity featured a mom named Julie, gently asking, “If we can’t pick our own doctor, how do I know my family’s going to get the care they need?” And: “Can I really trust the folks in Washington with my family’s health care?”\nIt turns out, Julie doesn’t really mean that she might not be able to select her doctor herself. Part of the group’s support for the claim is the small net decline, as estimated by the CBO, in those who get insurance through their employer, a drop of 7 million people by 2018. (A total of 158 million are expected to have employer-sponsored coverage that year.) The CBO has said that those losing coverage would mainly be low-wage workers who could get subsidies to buy insurance on the exchanges. And, certainly, there’s a chance the doctor a worker had been seeing won’t be in the network of providers on a new plan. Some exchange policies could keep prices low by limiting those networks. But no one will choose policyholders’ doctors for them. They simply won’t be guaranteed that a new plan would have the same network of doctors, just as there’s no guarantee of that now (more on this in a minute).\nAs for the government-coming-between-you-and-your-doctor claim, the law’s regulatory provisions are more like putting the government between you and your insurance company — and in a way that brings added benefits to consumers. The law says insurers can’t have caps on coverage, turn down customers based on preexisting conditions (or charge them more), and can’t spend more than 15 percent or 20 percent on non-medical-related costs (see Obama’s rebate claim above).\nRepublicans also have attacked the Independent Payment Advisory Board as some kind of rationing board. But the IPAB — which is made up of medical professionals, health care experts, economists and consumer representatives — is charged with slowing the rate of growth of Medicare spending, and limited in how it can go about doing that. The law says the board’s proposals “shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums … increase Medicare beneficiary cost sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.”\n“False Assumptions on the Health Care Law,” July 11\n“Romney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods,” June 28, 2012\n“Romney’s ‘Gross’ Exaggeration on ‘Obamacare,’ “May 10, 2012\nClaim: If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\nFactCheck.org: Misleading.\nObama has repeatedly made this claim, and the White House continues to use the line on its website. The law doesn’t force Americans to pick new plans or new doctors, but the president simply can’t make this promise to everyone. There’s no guarantee that your employer won’t switch plans, just as companies could have done before the law. And if you switch jobs, your new work-based coverage might not have your doctor as an in-network provider, either.\nAs we mentioned above, some employees won’t have an offer of insurance and will look for a new plan on the exchanges. Some small businesses could drop their current plans and join the exchanges, too. Grocery store chain Trader Joe’s, for instance, announced that it will direct its part-time workers (less than 30 hours per week) to the exchanges for health coverage and provide them with $500 to help purchase it, as of Jan. 1, 2014. The company, which has provided coverage to such workers, said “many crew members should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little, if any, net cost.”\n“Romney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods,” June 28, 2012\nAnd There’s More …\nClaim: Those applying for federal subsidies can lie about their income without facing verification.\nFactCheck.org says: False.\nThe Obama administration gave the insurance exchanges some leeway in how they verify income eligibility for federal subsidies in the first year. That prompted Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt to claim that the administration had “waived the income verification requirement” and that applicants can “say what you think your income’s going to be with no way to verify that.” Not true. The exchanges will compare applications with federal information — such as previous tax returns — and ask for additional information if the person has no previous tax filings.\nHere’s where the administration’s new rule comes in: For applications in which stated income is more than 10 percent below what’s listed in government data, current income information isn’t available, and the additional information from the applicants is insufficient, a sample of those applications will face further requirements in 2014. Initially, all of these suspect applications were to face more scrutiny, but the exchanges will only have to verify a sample for the first year of operation.\nSo, if you’re the gambling type, you do have better odds of lying about your income and still getting a subsidy. At least for a while. But all income claims will be checked against 2014 tax filings, and the IRS can recoup at least some of the money. There are also IRS perjury penalties, and civil monetary penalties spelled out in the Affordable Care Act for providing fraudulent information.\n“Blunt Wrong on Income Verification,” July 15\nClaim: Congress is exempt from the law.\nFactCheck.org says: False.\nSeveral versions of this claim have been circulating since before the Affordable Care Act was passed. But no matter how many different ways the critics spin it, Congress isn’t exempt from the law. In fact, members and their staffs face additional requirements that other Americans don’t. Beginning in 2014, they can no longer get insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, as they and other federal employees have done. Instead, they are required to get insurance through the insurance exchanges.\nThis “exempt” nonsense first percolated before that provision was added to the law through a Republican amendment. Before the amendment, the legislation said that Congress — as well as federal employees, employees of large companies, and those who get insurance through Medicare or Medicaid — wouldn’t be eligible for the exchanges, which were created by the law for those buying their own insurance and small businesses. But that certainly didn’t make Congress “exempt” — lawmakers were treated like any other worker with employer-provided health insurance. They were required to have coverage or face a penalty.\nThe claim has persisted even after the provision requiring Congress to get insurance from the exchanges became part of the final law. Fast forward to spring 2013, and the assertion surfaced again when there was concern among lawmakers that the transition to exchange plans — particularly the transfer of the federal contribution toward premiums — wouldn’t go very smoothly. Politico published a piece on April 24 on lawmakers talking about changing the exchange requirement because of this. The headline on the story: “Lawmakers, aides may get Obamacare exemption.”\nOn Aug. 7, the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the FEHB Program, issued a proposed rule saying that the federal government could continue to make contributions toward the premiums of lawmakers and their staffs on the exchanges. The federal government has long made such premium contributions, as other employers do for their employees. OPM said the contribution couldn’t be more than what it is under the FEHB Program. That ruling, perhaps predictably, sparked new — and still bogus — claims from Republicans of Congress being “exempt” from the law.\n“Congress Exempt from Health Bill?” Jan. 20, 2010\n“Congress and an Exemption from ‘Obamacare’?” May 3, 2013\n“No ‘Special Subsidy’ for Congress,” Aug. 30, 2013\nWe’re happy to report that one of the most paranoid claims about the law — that all patients would be implanted with microchips — appears to have died off, judging by the viral emails our readers send to us. But the law isn’t immune from new government-conspiracy-type claims. One of the latest is that the law includes forced home inspections. That wild distortion actually refers to grants for voluntary state home-visiting programs to help expectant and new parents. Forty-six states had such programs in fiscal 2010.\n— by Lori Robertson\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

This consists of $85.9 billion from the General Fund and $34.1 billion from special funds. While General Fund spending has dropped by around 6 percent from 2010–11, this has, in part been offset by increases in special fund spending as the state shifts some programs—from state to local responsibility under what has been called \"realignment\"—from General Fund support to special fund support. Federal funds spending continues to decline with the expiration of much of the funding made available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\nFigure 2 summarizes the estimated General Fund condition for 2010–11 and 2011–12.\nFigure 3 shows the solutions adopted to close the budget gap. The budget plan (including gubernatorial vetoes) includes the following actions (based upon our office's categorization):\nFigure 2 displays the estimated revenue effects of the revenue–related budget solutions in the budget package. By far, the most significant solutions were those that scored additional baseline revenues—that is, additional revenues above what was assumed in January due to economic performance and not any increase in tax rates or tax bases. Over one–half of the additional revenues were assumed consistent with the administration's May Revision economic forecast, and the remainder was built into the budget package during the final days of legislative action on the budget plan in June 2011. The budget package also authorized $2.9 billion of additional loans and transfers to the General Fund from state special funds. This included a $320 million loan from the Disability Insurance Fund. Many, but not all, of these loans and transfers are reflected in the loans and transfers item of Figure 1.\nThe realignment plan included in the 2011–12 budget package is discussed in more detail in \"Chapter 3.\" This section briefly discusses revenue actions in the budget that are related to the realignment plan.\nProposition 98 funding constitutes about 70 percent of total funding for K–12 education and the California Community Colleges (CCC). Proposition 98 funding also supports the state's subsidized preschool program and, historically, has supported certain child care programs. In this section, we review the changes in 2010–11 Proposition 98 spending and describe the major Proposition 98 components of the 2011–12 budget package. In the following three sections, we discuss in more detail the budgets for K–12 education, child care, and community colleges, respectively.\nFigure 1 shows all the changes in the 2011–12 Proposition 98 minimum guarantee relative to the January current–law estimate. These changes are discussed in more detail below.\nFigure 2 (see next page) shows funding levels for K–12 education, CCC, child care, and other Proposition 98–supported agencies (including the state special schools and juvenile justice). As the figure shows, total K–12 education funding remains relatively flat from 2010–11 to 2011–12. The share covered by local property taxes, however, is significantly higher (largely due to estimated redevelopment agency remittance payments) whereas the share covered by the General Fund is lower. Proposition 98 funding for community colleges is down $419 million year over year. Child care funding is removed from the Proposition 98 guarantee beginning in 2011–12. Although not evident from the figure (which shows only ongoing Proposition 98 funding), overall child care funding (including one–time funding) is reduced by roughly $400 million year over year.\nAs discussed earlier, the 2011–12 budget package includes various \"trigger\" reductions that would be implemented if estimates of state revenues as of December 2011 are more than $1 billion lower than budget assumptions, with additional reductions triggered if revenues fall more than $2 billion below budget assumptions.\nThe state currently faces a number of Proposition 98–related funding obligations associated with payment deferrals, K–12 revenue limits, mandates, the Quality Education Investment Act (QEIA), and the Emergency Repair Program (ERP).\nFigure 3 shows K–12 per–pupil programmatic funding from 2007–08 through 2011–12. Per–pupil programmatic funding decreased by $117 from 2010–11 to 2011–12, reflecting a 1.5 percent year–over–year reduction. School districts will receive $522 less per pupil in 2011–12 than in 2007–08.\nIn addition to K–12 revenue limit deferrals, discussed earlier, and a major change in funding for certain student mental health services, discussed below, the budget package includes the following K–12 spending changes.\nThe budget package includes a notable shift of program and funding responsibility related in student mental health services.\nThe budget package also includes several budget provisions that affect school district financial management and administration.\nAlthough former Stage 3 families maintained eligibility for services, uncertainty regarding the program's funding and status in the months following the veto resulted in decreased caseload numbers once program services resumed. (Some Stage 3 families re–enrolled in CalWORKs Stage 2 child care through the county–level Diversion program, resulting in a $27 million increase in 2010–11 Stage 2 costs compared to 2010–11 Budget Act assumptions.) As shown in Figure 4, budget estimates reflect diminished Stage 3 caseload levels continuing through 2011–12.\nFigure 5\nMajor Child Care and Development Spending Changes\n(In Millions)\n|\nChange\n|\nAmount\n|\n|\nReduce child care contracts by 11 percenta\n|\n–$177\n|\n|\nMake technical and caseload adjustments\n|\n–122\n|\n|\nReduce maximum reimbursement rate for license–exempt providers from 80 percent to 60 percent of licensed rate\n|\n–68b\n|\n|\nLower maximum income eligibility from 75 percent to 70 percent of the state median income\n|\n–28\n|\n|\nReduce or eliminate quality improvement activities\n|\n–16\n|\n|\nEliminate $7.9 million for Centralized Eligibility Lists, redirect funds to child care program\n|\n—\n|\n|\nTotal\n|\n–$412\n|\n<\nHigher Education\nThe enacted budget provides a total of $10.1 billion in General Fund support for higher education in 2011–12 (see Figure 6). This reflects a decrease of $1.4 billion, or 12 percent, from the 2010–11 amount. Thus, the 2011–12 budget more than eliminates the $911 million General Fund increase higher education received the previous year. As a result, higher education's share of state General Fund spending declines from 12.6 percent to 11.8 percent.\nFigure 6\nHigher Education Funding\nGeneral Fund (Dollars in Millions)\n|\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\nChange From 2010–11\n|\n|\nChange\n|\nPercent\n|\n|\nUniversity of California\n|\n$2,911.6\n|\n$2,374.1\n|\n$537.6\n|\n–18%\n|\n|\nCalifornia State University\n|\n2,607.7\n|\n2,141.3\n|\n466.4\n|\n–18\n|\n|\nCalifornia Community College\n|\n3,913.5\n|\n3,477.3\n|\n436.2\n|\n–11\n|\n|\nHastings University\n|\n8.4\n|\n6.9\n|\n1.4\n|\n–17\n|\n|\nCalifornia Student Aid Commission\n|\n1,257.3\n|\n1,402.9\n|\n145.6\n|\n12\n|\n|\nCalifornia Postsecondary Education Commission\n|\n1.9\n|\n—\n|\n1.9\n|\n–100\n|\n|\nGeneral obligation bond debt service\n|\n809.9\n|\n743.2\n|\n66.8\n|\n–8\n|\n|\nLease–revenue bond debt servicea\n|\n(265.8)\n|\n(267.7)\n|\n(1.9)\n|\n(1)\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$11,510.3\n|\n$10,145.6\n|\n$1,364.7\n|\n–12%\n|\nTuition Partly Backfills Cuts. All three public higher education segments will receive additional tuition and fee revenue as a result of approved increases. After diverting a portion of this new revenue to institutional financial aid programs, the segments will receive from these increases about $675 million, which effectively backfills an equal amount of their General Fund reductions. As explained below, this continues a recent trend whereby students pay an increasing share of the cost of their education.\nWhen all core sources of revenue (including General Fund, local property taxes, federal stimulus funds, and net fees/tuition) are considered, higher education's programmatic support is now about 7 percent lower than it was in 2010–11 (see Figure 7). Compared to 2007–08—generally considered to be the last \"normal\" funding year before the current recession necessitated spending reductions—higher education's programmatic support has declined about 2 percent.\nFigure 7\nHigher Education Programmatic Supporta\nSelected Core Funds (Dollars in Millions)\n|\n|\n2007–08\n|\n2008–09\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\nChange From 2010–11\n|\n|\nAmount\n|\nPercent\n|\n|\nUniversity of California\n|\n$4,399.7\n|\n$4,326.4\n|\n$4,067.0\n|\n$4,841.9\n|\n$4,313.6\n|\n–$528.22\n|\n–11%\n|\n|\nCalifornia State University\n|\n3,945.0\n|\n4,018.4\n|\n3,599.0\n|\n4,015.1\n|\n3,587.8\n|\n–427.30\n|\n–11\n|\n|\nCalifornia Community Colleges\n|\n6,702.9\n|\n6,796.0\n|\n6,442.6\n|\n6,595.4\n|\n6,228.6\n|\n–366.80\n|\n–6\n|\n|\nHastings College of the Law\n|\n32.3\n|\n36.8\n|\n39.1\n|\n42.7\n|\n42.4\n|\n–0.30\n|\n–1\n|\n|\nCalifornia Postsecondary Education Commission\n|\n2.1\n|\n2.0\n|\n1.8\n|\n1.9\n|\n—\n|\n–1.85\n|\n—\n|\n|\nCalifornia Student Aid Commission\n|\n866.7\n|\n912.3\n|\n1,075.5\n|\n1,357.5\n|\n1,465.1\n|\n107.63\n|\n8\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n|\n$16,091.9\n|\n|\n$16,854.4\n|\n|\n|\n–7%\n|\nUC and CSU\nOverall Funding. As shown in Figure 6, the 2011–12 budget provides $2.4 billion in General Fund support to the University of California (UC), and $2.1 billion to the California State University (CSU). For both university systems, these amounts reflect net reductions of 18 percent. Specifically, each segment received a General Fund reduction of $650 million, a General Fund augmentation of $106 million to replace one–time federal stimulus funds in the 2010–11 budget, and a variety of other technical adjustments. Approved tuition increases (net of amounts set aside for student financial aid) will backfill about $266 million and $300 million, respectively, of UC and CSU's General Fund reductions. As a result, the decline in total programmatic funding for each system is about 11 percent.\nPotential for Further General Fund Reductions. The UC and CSU budgets each reflect a $500 million reduction originally proposed in the Governor's January budget, as well as an additional $150 million reduction included in the final budget agreement. As described in \"Chapter 1\", the enacted budget makes provision for an additional $100 million General Fund reduction to each university system in the event that anticipated state revenues are not realized. If the Director of Finance determines that revenues are projected to fall more than $1 billion short, the Director must reduce UC and CSU's General Fund appropriations by up to $100 million each.\nEnrollment Targets. The 2011–12 budget sets state–supported enrollment targets of 209,977 full–time equivalent (FTE) students at UC and 331,716 FTE students at CSU. The target for UC is the same as the 2010–11 target, while the CSU target is about 8,000 FTE students lower than in 2010–11. The CSU's enrollment fell short of its target in 2010–11, and a provision in that year's budget caused $75 million in General Fund support associated with that enrollment shortfall to be reverted from CSU's budget. In a departure from past practice, the 2011–12 budget provides for no reversion of funding if either university system falls short of its enrollment target.\nStudent Tuition. Both UC and CSU have approved the following tuition increases for the 2011–12 academic year:\n- The UC Regents initially adopted an 8 percent increase at their November 2010 meeting. In July 2011, following adoption of the 2011–12 Budget Act, they approved an additional 9.6 percent increase. Together, those actions bring 2011–12 mandatory systemwide charges to $12,192—an overall increase of 18.3 percent. Including mandatory campus fees, undergraduate students will pay an average of about $13,218 at UC campuses.\n- The CSU Trustees initially adopted a 10 percent tuition increase for 2011–12 in November 2010, and approved an additional 12 percent increase in July, for an overall increase of 23.2 percent. Mandatory systemwide charges for CSU undergraduates will be $5,472, with campus fees (some of which may increase) adding another $1,000 on average.\nThe 2011–12 tuition increases are expected to generate about $415 million at UC and $450 million at CSU in additional revenues. Both segments plan to increase financial aid expenditures by about one–third of this amount. In addition, Cal Grant recipients will receive larger grants to cover the tuition increases.\nOther Provisions. The budget includes several new requirements for the universities. One provision requires UC to allocate $3 million of its General Fund appropriation for scheduled salary increases for its service employees. Other provisions provide guidance as to how the universities allocate their budget reductions, prohibiting disproportionate cuts in academic preparation and outreach programs at both segments, and in certain math, science, and nursing education programs at UC. The Budget Act makes explicit a longstanding prohibition on the use of General Fund appropriations to support auxiliary enterprises or intercollegiate athletic programs at UC. Trailer bill language strengthens requirements for CSU's annual systemwide audit and removes a requirement for individual campus audits.\nCapital Outlay. The budget includes appropriations for six UC projects—$45.3 million in lease–revenue bond funding for two new projects, and $9.3 million in general obligation bond funding for the equipment phase of four projects. It also includes appropriations for seven CSU projects—$201 million in lease–revenue bond funding for five new projects, and $2.8 million in general obligation bond funding for the equipment phase of two projects.\nCalifornia Community Colleges\nLike K–12 education, community colleges' local property tax revenue and most of their General Fund support is included within Proposition 98's funding formulas. Figure 2 (in the \"Proposition 98\" section of this chapter) shows that the 2011–12 budget package provides the CCC system with $5.4 billion in Proposition 98 funding, which is 11.1 percent of total state Proposition 98 spending. This reflects a reduction of $419 million (7 percent) from the revised 2010–11 spending level.\nBudget Defers More Funding to Later Years. As noted earlier in the \"Proposition 98\" section, the 2011–12 budget defers an additional $129 million to 2012–13, thereby creating a total ongoing deferral of $961 million. This represents about 17 percent of Proposition 98 funding for CCC.\nBase Apportionment Cuts Coupled With Workload–Reduction Provision. The budget includes a $400 million base reduction in Proposition 98 General Fund support for CCC apportionments (general–purpose monies), offset by an increase of $110 million in fee revenue. The budget includes a provision that permits community colleges to reduce the number of students they serve in 2011–12 in proportion to the net reduction in base apportionment funding ($290 million). The provision expresses the Legislature's intent that any resulting workload reductions be limited as much as possible to \"courses and programs outside of those needed by students to achieve their basic skills, workforce training, or transfer goals.\"\nHigher Student Fees to Mitigate Budget Cuts. The budget package increases enrollment fees from $26 per unit to $36 per unit beginning in the fall 2011 term. The budget assumes that these higher fees will generate $110 million in additional revenue for CCC, thereby mitigating the impact of reduced Proposition 98 General Fund support for apportionments.\nCategorical–Program Flexibility Extended. As discussed in our 2009–10 California Spending Plan (page 34), the 2009–10 budget created a \"flex item\" so that, between 2009–10 and 2012–13, community colleges could transfer funds from about a dozen categorical programs to any other categorical spending purpose. The 2011–12 budget package extends this flexibility until the end of 2014–15.\nMandates. The budget provides $9.5 million in Proposition 98 monies for CCC mandates, and suspends 7 of CCC's 21 mandates. Two of these seven mandates were added in the 2011–12 budget (Student Records and Sexual Assault Response Procedures).\nTrigger Cuts. As noted in the \"Proposition 98\" section, if projected 2011–12 state revenues fall short by at least $1 billion, CCC's apportionment funding would be reduced by an additional $30 million. In addition, enrollment fees would be increased from $36 per unit to $46 per unit beginning in January 2012, which would likely generate enough revenues to backfill the $30 million cut. If projected 2011–12 state revenues fall short by more than $2 billion, CCC apportionments would be further reduced by $72 million.\nCapital Outlay. The 2011–12 budget package appropriates $48.6 million in general obligation bond funding for three continuing projects (at City College of San Francisco, College of the Canyons, and Orange Coast College).\nCalifornia Postsecondary Education Commission (CPEC)\nThe Governor's May Revision proposed to reduce CPEC's General Fund support roughly by half, and eliminate the commission as of January 1, 2012. Most of CPEC's functions would disappear, with the exception of a federal teacher grant program that would be transferred from CPEC to CDE. The Legislature rejected the Governor's proposal, and restored full funding for CPEC. The Legislature also adopted supplemental report language directing LAO to recommend structures and duties for a statewide higher education coordinating body. The report is to be submitted to the Legislature by January 1, 2012.\nThe Governor vetoed all funding for CPEC, and in his veto message requested that the three segments and other higher education stakeholders explore alternatives for coordinating higher education.\nCalifornia Student Aid Commission (CSAC)\nThe budget provides $1.5 billion for CSAC, including $1.4 billion in General Fund support, $62.3 million in one–time funds from the Student Loan Operating Fund (SLOF), and $15 million in federal funds for Cal Grants and other financial aid programs. This reflects an increase of about $145 million from the 2010–11 level, primarily to offset tuition increases at UC and CSU. However, given that UC and CSU raised tuition further after passage of the budget act, actual Cal Grant costs are likely to be at least $100 million higher than the amount appropriated for this purpose.\nThe budget act and related legislation make two significant changes to the operation of Cal Grants programs:\n- Tighter Eligibility Criteria for Renewals. Previously, Cal Grant recipients only had to meet certain eligibility criteria when they first applied for a Cal Grant (and not when they renewed the grant in subsequent years). Changes enacted with the budget package now require Cal Grant recipients applying for renewals to meet several of those requirements. For example, a renewal applicant's family income and assets must fall below specified levels (see Figure 8). Applying these requirements to renewals will disqualify an estimated 12,920 recipients who would otherwise be eligible for awards, reducing Cal Grant expenditures by about $100 million. To mitigate the impact on students, CSAC will use the higher of the limits in place at the time of a student's initial award and those in place at the time of renewal.\n- New Restrictions on Student Loan Default Rates. A second change enacted by the budget package removes some higher education institutions from eligibility to participate in Cal Grant programs. Specifically, institutions may not participate if a high proportion of their former students default on federal student loans. For 2011–12, the threshold is set at 24.6 percent of an institution's students defaulting within three years of loan repayment, as defined and calculated by the federal government. For subsequent years, the ceiling is 30 percent. These ceilings apply only to institutions with 40 percent or more of undergraduates borrowing federal student loans. For 2011–12, about 76 institutions are affected, and most of these are career and technical colleges. There is a limited exception for continuing students at institutions that become ineligible. These students may qualify for renewal awards reduced by 20 percent.\nFigure 8\n2011–12 California Grant Program Income and Asset Ceilings for Dependent Students\n|\nFamily Size\n|\nCal Grant A and C\n|\nCal Grant B\n|\n|\nIncome Ceilings\n|\n|\n|\n|\nSix or more\n|\n$90,300\n|\n$49,600\n|\n|\nFive\n|\n83,800\n|\n46,000\n|\n|\nFour\n|\n78,100\n|\n41,100\n|\n|\nThree\n|\n71,900\n|\n36,900\n|\n|\nTwo\n|\n70,200\n|\n32,800\n|\n|\nAsset Ceiling\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAll family sizes\n|\n60,500\n|\n60,500\n|\nFederal Loan Program. In November 2010, the U.S. Department of Education transferred federal student loans guaranteed by CSAC (and serviced by its auxiliary, EdFund) to Education Credit Management Corporation (ECMC), ending California's role in administering federally guaranteed loans. As part of the transition, ECMC has entered into a two–year agreement to provide CSAC with technical and operational support previously offered by EdFund. In addition to providing some services, ECMC has also agreed to continue sharing proceeds from SLOF to offset Cal Grant costs. The Governor's budget assumed a $30 million General Fund offset from this source, and subsequent actions by the ECMC Board raised the available amount to $62.25 million. The SLOF contributions are expected to continue beyond the two–year service agreement, with available amounts to be determined annually by the ECMC Board.\nRealignment\nAs part of the 2011–12 budget package, the Legislature made a number of changes to realign certain state program responsibilities and revenues to local governments (primarily counties). Figure 3 in \"Chapter 1\" identifies the budget–related bills including those related to the realignment package. In total, the realignment plan provides $6.3 billion in 2011–12 to local governments to fund various criminal justice, mental health, and social service programs. The plan adopted by the Legislature is largely similar to the one proposed by the Governor, as modified in the May Revision, with respect to the programs realigned and the amount of revenue provided to local governments. However, the adopted realignment package differs in two important respects from the administration's proposal. First, the Legislature's plan relies on a shift of existing state and local tax revenues rather than the extension of expiring tax rates as proposed by the Governor. Second, the adopted budget legislation does not include the Governor's proposal for a constitutional amendment to, among other things, make the funding allocations to local governments permanent and protect the state from potential mandate claims. We discuss the details of the adopted realignment package in more detail below.\nArchitecture of 2011 Realignment\n2011–12 Expenditures\nThe realignment package includes $6.3 billion in 2011–12 for court security, corrections and public safety, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, child welfare programs, adult protective services, and CalWORKs. Figure 9 displays the amounts dedicated to each of the realigned programs in 2011–12.\nFigure 9\nExpenditures for 2011 Realignment\n(In Millions)\n|\nAdult offenders and parolees\n|\n$1,587\n|\n|\nLocal public safety grant programs\n|\n490\n|\n|\nCourt security\n|\n496\n|\n|\nExisting juvenile justice realignment\n|\n97\n|\n|\nEarly and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n|\n579\n|\n|\nMental health managed care\n|\n184\n|\n|\nDrug and alcohol programs—substance abuse treatment\n|\n184\n|\n|\nFoster care and child welfare services\n|\n1,567\n|\n|\nAdult protective services\n|\n55\n|\n|\nCalWORKs/mental health transfer\n|\n1,084\n|\n|\nCalWORKs\n|\n(1,066)\n|\n|\nMental health\n|\n(18)\n|\n|\nTotal\n|\n$6,322\n|\nShift of Existing State and Local Revenues\nUnlike the Governor's realignment proposal, the realignment package adopted by the Legislature does not extend the sales and vehicle license fee (VLF) tax rate increases that expired at the end of 2010–11. Instead, the budget reallocates $5.6 billion of state sales tax and state and local VLF revenues for purposes of realignment in 2011–12. Specifically, the Legislature approved the diversion of 1.0625 cents of the state's sales and use tax rate to counties. This is projected to generate $5.1 billion in 2011–12, growing to $6.4 billion in 2014–15 (see Figure 10,). In addition, the realignment plan redirects an estimated $453 million from the base 0.65 percent VLF rate for local law enforcement grant programs. Under prior law, these VLF revenues were allocated to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) ($300 million) for administrative purposes and to cities and Orange County ($153 million) for general purposes. The budget increases the motor vehicle registration fee by $12 per automobile to offset the lost revenue to DMV. The budget also shifts $763 million on a one–time basis in 2011–12 from the Mental Health Services Fund (established with voter approval of Proposition 63 in November 2004) for support of the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) and Mental Health Managed Care programs.\nFigure 10\nRevenues for Realignment\n(In Millions)\n|\n|\n2011–12\n|\n2012–13\n|\n2013–14\n|\n2014–15\n|\n|\nSales and use tax\n|\n$5,106\n|\n$5,571\n|\n$6,015\n|\n$6,388\n|\n|\nVehicle license fee\n|\n453\n|\n453\n|\n453\n|\n453\n|\n|\nProposition 63\n|\n763\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$6,322\n|\n$6,025\n|\n$6,468\n|\n$6,841\n|\nRealignment Account Structure\nThe revenues provided for realignment are deposited into a new fund, the Local Revenue Fund 2011. The budget package creates 8 separate accounts and 12 subaccounts within this fund to pay for the realigned programs. One of the accounts, the Mental Health Account, is somewhat different than the other accounts because its funds support the CalWORKs program and interact with accounts created in 1991 under the state–local realignment plan adopted at that time. Another account created in the Local Revenue Fund 2011 is the Reserve Account, where revenues in excess of the amount projected for each account are deposited. The budget legislation requires revenue deposited into the Reserve Account to be used to reimburse counties for programs paid from the Foster Care, Drug Medi–Cal, and Adoption Assistance Program Subaccounts. In addition, for 2011–12, the budget assumes that about $1.2 billion of the funds deposited into the Local Revenue Fund 2011 will be used to reimburse the state for costs associated with incarcerating and supervising inmates and parolees who were convicted prior to the implementation of realignment.\nThe budget legislation establishes various formulas to determine how much revenue is deposited into each account and subaccount. Several of these accounts and subaccounts have annual caps on how much funding each can receive. The budget package limits the use of funds deposited into each account and subaccount to the specific programmatic purpose of the account or subaccount. The budget does not contain any provisions allowing cities or counties flexibility to shift funds among these programs. The budget legislation also contains some formulas and general direction to determine how the funding would be allocated among counties. The budget legislation does not specify program allocations among the various accounts and subaccounts, or among counties, for 2012–13 and beyond (except for the CalWORKs/mental health transfer which appears to be ongoing). Despite uncertainty surrounding these ongoing allocations, the revenues being deposited into the Local Revenue Fund 2011 for purposes of realignment are expected to be ongoing.\nLegislative Intent for Future Actions. The budget package also includes legislative intent language that (1) new allocation formulas be developed for 2012–13 and subsequent fiscal years, and (2) sufficient protections be in place to provide ongoing funding and mandate protection for the state and local governments.\nMost of State Fiscal Benefit From Proposition 98 Savings\nThe budget assumes that, by depositing the sales tax revenue into a special fund for use by local governments for realignment, these funds are not available for the Legislature to spend for education purposes and thus are not counted as state revenue for purposes of calculating the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee. As discussed more fully in our education section of this report, this action reduced the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee by $2.1 billion. The exclusion of these revenues, however, is contingent upon the approval of a ballot measure providing additional funding for K–12 school districts and community colleges. If no ballot measure is adopted satisfying these requirements, the funds would not be excluded from the guarantee moving forward and the state would need to repay K–14 education for the loss of $2.1 billion for the 2011–12 year.\nIn addition to the Proposition 98 savings, the realignment plan achieves state General Fund savings in two other ways. First, using VLF revenue to fund local law enforcement grant programs reduces the state's costs for these programs by $453 million. Second, the budget assumes about $86 million in savings to the state associated with corrections realignment. Offsetting these savings, however, is $34 million provided in the budget to support local government hiring, training, and other transition costs associated with implementing the corrections realignment in 2011–12.\nDescription of Realignment Changes\nWe describe each of the major programs included in the realignment package below.\nAdult Offenders and Parolees\nAs part of the 2011–12 budget package, the Legislature shifted the responsibility for certain lower–level offenders, parole violators, and parolees from the state to the counties on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2011. Under the realignment plan, the shifted offenders who previously would have been sentenced to state prison will now serve their sentence in a county jail and/or under local community supervision. In addition, certain offenders released from prison will now be supervised in the community by county agencies (such as county probation) instead of by state parole agents. When locally supervised offenders violate the terms and conditions of their supervision, the courts, rather than the Board of Parole Hearings, will preside over revocation hearings to determine if they should be revoked to county jail. According to the administration, the above changes are projected to reduce the state inmate population by about 14,000 inmates in 2011–12 and nearly 40,000 inmates (roughly one–fourth of the total inmate population) upon full implementation in 2014–15. The state parolee population is projected to decline by about 25,000 parolees in 2011–12 and by 77,000 parolees (roughly three–fourths of the total parole population) in 2014–15. The budget assumes that the reduction in the inmate and parolee populations will result in state savings of about $453 million in 2011–12, growing to $1.5 billion upon full implementation.\nThe realignment plan assumes a total of $1.6 billion from the Local Revenue Fund 2011 to support the realignment of adult offenders and parolees in 2011. Of this total, $354 million will be transferred to the newly established Local Community Corrections Account to support the local incarceration and supervision of the realigned offenders. In addition, the plan estimates that about $13 million will be transferred into the District Attorney and Public Defender Account to support the involvement of district attorneys and public defenders in parole revocation proceedings. The funds in these two accounts will be distributed in 2011–12 to counties based on a formula that takes into account various factors, such as the proportion of the state prison population that is from a particular county. The realignment plan also assumes that the Local Revenue Fund 2011 will reimburse the state about $1.2 billion for costs that the state incurs in 2011–12 for lower–level offenders in state prison who were sentenced prior to October 1, 2011 (when the realignment is implemented).\nLocal Public Safety Grant Programs\nUnder the realignment plan, funding for various local public safety grant programs (such as the Citizens' Option for Public Safety Program, juvenile justice grant programs, and booking fees) will be shifted directly to local governments for the same purposes as specified in existing statutes.\nUnder the plan, a total of about $490 million will be transferred to the newly established Local Law Enforcement Services Account—an estimated $453 million from the redirection of existing VLF revenue and $37 million from the Local Revenue Fund 2011—to support the realigned public safety grant programs. For 2011–12, the funds in this account will be allocated to local governments by the State Controller's Office generally based on the level of funding received for each grant program in recent years. The realignment plan requires that, if there are insufficient revenues to fully fund this account, the Director of Finance shall allocate the funds necessary from the Local Revenue Fund 2011 to provide the full allocation.\nCourt Security\nCurrent law generally requires trial courts to contract with their local sheriff's offices for court security. Under the realignment plan, the sheriffs would continue to be responsible for providing court security. However, funding to pay for the security will now be provided directly to the sheriffs rather than being appropriated in the annual state budget to the trial courts. Existing statutes related to court security (such as the requirement that each trial court negotiate a memorandum of understanding with the sheriff specifying the level of security to be provided) are unchanged.\nThe realignment plan estimates that $496 million from the Local Revenue Fund 2011 will be transferred to the newly established Trial Court Security Account for allocation to county sheriffs for the provision of court security. Under the terms of the realignment legislation, the Department of Finance (DOF) will determine how much money is allocated to each county sheriff for these purposes in 2011–12. According to DOF, the allocation of funds in 2011–12 will generally be determined based on the amount of state funding a given sheriff's office received in 2010–11 for court security.\nExisting Juvenile Justice Realignment\nUnder recent statutory changes, only certain juvenile offenders who are violent, serious, or sex offenders may be committed to youth correctional facilities operated by the state. Counties are responsible for the housing and supervision of all other juvenile offenders, as well as for the community supervision of all offenders upon their release from state youth correctional facilities, including some who previously were state responsibility. Counties receive state funding from two grants to support these responsibilities—the Youthful Offender Block Grant Program and the Juvenile Reentry Grant. Under the realignment plan, funding for these grants will be shifted directly to counties for the same purposes as specified in existing statutes.\nThe realignment plan estimates that $97 million from the Local Revenue Fund 2011 will be transferred to the Juvenile Justice Account in support of the above grants—$93.4 million for the Youthful Offender Block Grant Program and $3.7 million for the Juvenile Reentry Grant. The allocation of these grants among the 58 counties is unchanged in 2011–12.\nMental Health Managed Care (MHMC)\nCounty Mental Health Plans administer MHMC and are responsible for ensuring that Medi–Cal beneficiaries receive specialty mental health services. Under a federal waiver, specialty mental health services are \"carved out\" of the Medi–Cal program administered by the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), which provides physical health care. County mental health plans generally have responsibility for authorization and payment of Medi–Cal covered psychiatric inpatient hospital services and outpatient specialty mental health services. In November 2004, the state's voters approved Proposition 63, an initiative that allocated additional state revenues generated through a surcharge on income taxpayers earning more than $1 million annually for various specified community mental health programs.\nUnder realignment, in 2011–12 about $184 million of Proposition 63 (Mental Health Services Act) funds will be redirected and used in lieu of General Fund on a one–time basis to support MHMC. Proposition 63 revenues are not deposited into the Local Revenue Fund 2011. Although the final budget package did not specify ongoing realignment allocations, the administration's plan was for realignment revenues to substitute for the Proposition 63 funds on an ongoing basis beginning in 2012–13.\nEarly and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment\nThe EPSDT is a federally mandated program that requires the state to provide Medi–Cal beneficiaries under age 21 with any physical and mental health services that are deemed medically necessary to correct or ameliorate a defect, physical or mental illness, including services not otherwise included in the state's Medicaid plan. Periodic health screening, vision, dental, and hearing services are provided under EPSDT. So are some mental health services, including crisis intervention and medication monitoring. County mental health plans generally have responsibility for authorization and payment of mental health services provided through EPSDT.\nUnder realignment, in 2011–12, about $580 million of Proposition 63 funds will be redirected and used in lieu of General Fund on a one–time basis to support EPSDT. Proposition 63 funds are not deposited into the Local Revenue Fund 2011. Although the final budget package did not specify ongoing realignment allocations, the administration's plan was for realignment revenues to substitute for the Proposition 63 funds on an ongoing basis beginning in 2012–13.\nDrug and Alcohol Programs—Substance Abuse Treatment\nThe budget plan realigns several substance abuse treatment programs that were previously funded through the Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs (DADP). While DADP in the past provided funding and state oversight of these programs, the provision of services has long been administered primarily at the county level. The major substance abuse treatment programs that have been realigned are:\n- Regular and Perinatal Drug Medi–Cal. The Drug Medi–Cal program provides drug and alcohol–related treatment services to Medi–Cal beneficiaries. These include outpatient drug free services, narcotic replacement therapy, day care rehabilitative services, and residential services for pregnant and parenting women.\n- Regular and Perinatal Non Drug Medi–Cal. The Non Drug Medi–Cal program provides treatment services generally to individuals who do not qualify for Medi–Cal. This includes the Women and Children's Residential Treatment Services Program.\n- Drug Courts. Drug courts link supervision and treatment of drug users with ongoing judicial monitoring and oversight.\nThe budget plan realigns a total of about $184 million of DADP programs (Regular and Perinatal Drug Medi–Cal, $131 million; Regular and Perinatal Non Drug–Medi–Cal, $26 million; and Drug Courts, $27 million) to the counties. Under the realignment plan, funding for these programs are deposited into three separate subaccounts within the newly created Health and Human Services Account of the Local Revenue Fund 2011. Under realignment, some programs would be supported with a combination of realignment funds and federal matching funds, while other programs would be supported mainly by realignment funds.\nFoster Care and Child Welfare Services (CWS)\nCalifornia's child welfare system was created to prevent, identify, and respond to allegations of child abuse and neglect. Under prior law, the state and counties shared the nonfederal costs of the child welfare system. Pursuant to the realignment legislation of 2011, counties will now bear 100 percent of the costs for nearly the entire child welfare system, including CWS, Foster Care, Adoptions, Adoptions Assistance, and Child Abuse Prevention. (The state will continue to oversee the CWS Case Management System, social worker training, state–tribal agreements, and some adoptions services.) The realignment legislation does not change the major programmatic functions of the child welfare system. Counties, which were already responsible for ensuring the safety of children within their communities, will continue to make the decision of whether or not to remove a child from a home due to allegations of abuse or neglect. Meanwhile, the state will continue to oversee the child welfare system.\nThe budget legislation creates five child welfare system program subaccounts within the Health and Human Services Account of the Local Revenue Fund 2011. Under this arrangement, total funding for the child welfare system is estimated to be about $1.6 billion in 2011–12. The allocations for each subaccount are designed to be equal to what the programs would have received in General Fund support absent realignment. Funding in the CWS subaccount will be distributed among counties based on the 2010–11 allocation structure. Funding in the other subaccounts will be distributed to counties based on an allocation provided by DOF.\nAdult Protective Services (APS)\nCounty APS agencies investigate reports of abuse and neglect of elders and dependent adults who live in private settings. Upon investigating these reports, APS social workers may arrange for services such as counseling, money management, or out–of–home placement for the abused or neglected adult. Although there is no federal requirement to operate an APS program, state law currently requires that APS be available in all 58 counties.\nThe 2011–12 realignment legislation establishes the APS Subaccount within the Health and Human Services Account for the support of the APS program. The APS Subaccount will be allocated 3 percent of the funds available in the Health and Human Services Account, which is estimated to be $55 million in 2011–12. The funds from the APS Subaccount will be allocated to the local APS programs, to the extent possible, in the same way they were in 2010–11.\nCalWORKs/Mental Health Transfer\nThe CalWORKs program provides cash grants and welfare–to–work services (such as child care, training, or job readiness) to families whose incomes are insufficient to meet their basic needs. The program is administered by the counties, but the state and federal governments provide the vast majority of funding. Although each county must provide grants and services consistent with state law, counties have significant control over how services are provided and when to sanction clients for noncompliance. With respect to funding, counties have a fixed maintenance–of–effort level for administration and welfare–to–work services, and a 2.5 percent share of grant costs. The 2011 realignment legislation provides counties with revenue from the Local Revenue Fund 2011 for mental health programs, which then frees up existing county mental health funding to pay for a higher share of CalWORKs grant costs. This process is described in more detail below.\nIn 1991, the Legislature adopted realignment legislation that, among other changes, established several local funding streams for various mental health and other programs. This included creation of a mental health subaccount and a social services subaccount. The 1991 social services subaccount is available to fund several programs including CalWORKs. The 2011 realignment legislation provides $1,084 million in funding for a new Mental Health Account in the Local Revenue Fund 2011. From this account, the 2011 legislation allocates to each county new mental health funding equal to what it would have received in its mental health subaccount under the 1991 realignment formula. Because the new funding is now available to pay mental health obligations, the 2011 legislation shifts the preexisting 1991 mental health funding to the social services subaccount with no detrimental effect on support for county mental health programs. The 2011 realignment legislation also increases each county's individual share of CalWORKs grant costs so that it exactly equals the amount of its new mental health realignment funds. Essentially, the additional mental health funding for 2011 pays for an increased county share of CalWORKs grants. On average this new county share for CalWORKs grants will be about 34 percent, but the exact amount will vary by county and be directly tied to what the county would have received under the 1991 formula for distribution of funding for mental health services. The amounts provided to counties will be recalculated each year to equal whatever they would otherwise have been under the 1991 formula.\nHealth\nThe 2011–12 spending plan provides $19.7 billion from the General Fund for health programs. This is an increase of $2.2 billion, or 12.5 percent, compared to the revised prior–year spending level, as shown in Figure 11. The net increase largely reflects the following: (1) increases in caseload and utilization of services, (2) the expiration of federal economic stimulus funds used to temporarily offset state General Fund costs, (3) the adoption of significant health program reductions and cost–containment measures, and (4) shifts in the funding sources used to support various health programs. The major program–specific changes and cost–containment measures are summarized in Figure 12 (see next page) and discussed in more detail below.\nFigure 11\nMajor Health Programs and Departments—Spending Trend\nGeneral Fund (Dollars in Millions)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nChange2010–11 to 2011–12\n|\n|\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\nAmount\n|\nPercent\n|\n|\nMedi–Cal—Local Assistance\n|\n$10,136\n|\n$12,437\n|\n$14,701\n|\n$2,264\n|\n18.2%\n|\n|\nDepartment of Developmental Services\n|\n2,419\n|\n2,451\n|\n2,622\n|\n171\n|\n7.0\n|\n|\nDepartment of Mental Health\n|\n1,711\n|\n1,852\n|\n1,314a\n|\n–538\n|\n–29.0\n|\n|\nHealthy Families Program—Local Assistance\n|\n217\n|\n126\n|\n286\n|\n160\n|\n127.0\n|\n|\nDepartment of Public Health\n|\n184\n|\n186\n|\n226\n|\n40\n|\n21.5\n|\n|\nDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Programs\n|\n189\n|\n189\n|\n222\n|\n33\n|\n17.5\n|\n|\nOther Department of Health Care Services programs\n|\n106\n|\n32\n|\n96\n|\n64\n|\n200.0\n|\n|\nEmergency Medical Services Authority\n|\n8\n|\n8\n|\n7\n|\n–1\n|\n–12.5\n|\n|\nAll other health programs (including state support)\n|\n212\n|\n221\n|\n219\n|\n–2\n|\n–0.9\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$15,182\n|\n$17,502\n|\n$19,693\n|\n$2,191\n|\n12.5%\n|\n|\nCosts paid from temporary federal funds\n|\n$3,995\n|\n$3,777\n|\n$31\n|\n|\n|\n|\nEstimated realignment savingsb\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n–$184\n|\n|\n|\nExpiration of Enhanced Federal Funding. The ARRA, the 2009 federal economic stimulus law, and subsequent federal legislation extended fiscal relief to the states. California benefited from an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), which is the federal share of Medicaid costs, from October 2008 through June 2011. Normally the state pays 50 percent of costs for most Medi–Cal services and the federal government pays the balance. The ARRA temporarily increased the federal matching share to 61.59 percent. Subsequent federal legislation extended the enhanced FMAP for an additional six months, but reduced the level of federal funding available during this phase–out period in comparison to ARRA. The budget adjusts for the loss of about $3.8 billion in federal funding due to the expiration of the enhanced FMAP that the state received in 2010–11, thereby increasing state General Fund costs in the budget year. While the expiration of enhanced federal funding mainly affects General Fund expenditure levels for Medi–Cal benefits provided by DHCS, it also affects components of the Medi–Cal Program administered by other state departments that administer health programs.\nFederal Waiver Helps State Achieve Savings. The budget assumes $400 million in General Fund savings related to Medi–Cal's 1115 demonstration waiver renewal. Under the waiver, the state may claim up to $400 million in federal funds to offset costs in designated state health programs that are generally supported only with state funds. The waiver savings are reflected in the budget as follows: (1) $219 million in Medi–Cal local assistance, (2) $74 million in AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) savings, and (3) $106 million in savings for DHCS Family Health Programs.\nAdministration States Intent to Eliminate Departments. As part of its 2011–12 budget proposal, the administration stated its intent to eventually eliminate the Department of Mental Health (DMH) and DADP. Responsibility for the programs administered by DMH and DADP would be transferred to other departments, agencies, and government entities. The administration indicates that as part of its 2012–13 budget proposal, it will submit a detailed plan to eliminate these two departments.\nDepartment of Health Care Services (Medi–Cal)\nThe spending plan provides $14.7 billion from the General Fund for Medi–Cal local assistance expenditures administered by DHCS. This is an increase of almost $2.3 billion, or 18 percent, in General Fund support for Medi–Cal local assistance compared to the revised prior–year spending level. In addition to growth in caseload and utilization, several major factors contributed to this net increase:\n- Expiration of FMAP. General Fund support was needed to offset the loss of $3.2 billion due to the expiration of the enhanced FMAP.\n- Acceleration of Provider Payments. The administration took advantage of the enhanced FMAP before it expired by making payments to Medi–Cal providers and some managed care plans earlier than previously scheduled to achieve General Fund savings of $144 million. The accelerated payments resulted in a prior year cost of $691 million and reduced costs of $835 million in 2011–12.\n- Hospital Quality Assurance Fee. The revised prior–year spending level reflected an estimated $770 million in hospital fee revenue from the imposition of a quality insurance fee used to offset General Fund costs. As we discuss below, pending legislation would again impose a quality assurance fee on hospitals that could generate an estimated $320 million in General Fund relief in 2011–12.\n- Other Changes. The spending plan includes program reductions, fund shifts, and cost–containment measures that reduce program costs as shown in Figure 12.\nFigure 12\nMajor Changes—State Health Programs2011–12 General Fund Effect\n(In Millions)\n|\nProgram\n|\nAmount\n|\n|\nMedi–Cal—Department of Health Care Services\n|\n|\n|\nImpose provider payment reduction of up to 10 percent\n|\n–$623\n|\n|\nImpose mandatory copayments on Medi–Cal beneficiaries\n|\n–511\n|\n|\nImplement unallocated reduction\n|\n–345\n|\n|\nEliminate Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) benefit\n|\n–170\n|\n|\nProvide funds to transition ADHC beneficiaries to other services\n|\n85\n|\n|\nAdopt fund shifts and one–time funding sources\n|\n–128\n|\n|\nCollect additional drug rebates\n|\n–64\n|\n|\nImpose \"soft cap\" on physician and clinic visits\n|\n–41\n|\n|\nCollect state share of intergovernmental transfers\n|\n–34\n|\n|\nImpose utilization limits and eliminate certain benefits\n|\n–16\n|\n|\nDepartment of Mental Health\n|\n|\n|\nShift support for mental health programs from General Fund to Proposition 63 funds\n|\n–763\n|\n|\nProvide resources to improve safety and security in state hospitals\n|\n10\n|\n|\nExpand psychiatric program at California Medical Facility—Vacaville\n|\n6\n|\n|\nProvide funds to activate Stockton health care facility\n|\n1\n|\n|\nDepartment of Developmental Services\n|\n|\n|\nImplement various cost–containment measures for community programs\n|\n–284\n|\n|\nExtend provider payment reduction of 4.25 percent\n|\n–92\n|\n|\nAssume additional federal funds from various initiatives\n|\n–78\n|\n|\nReduce funding for Developmental Centers\n|\n–28\n|\n|\nDepartment of Public Health\n|\n|\n|\nImpose several measures to achieve public health savings\n|\n–8\n|\n|\nHealthy Families Program\n|\n|\n|\nImplement unallocated reduction\n|\n–103\n|\n|\nIncrease premiums paid by families for children's health insurance\n|\n–22\n|\n|\nIncrease copayments for emergency department visits and inpatient hospital stays\n|\n–6\n|\n|\nReduce the scope of the vision benefit\n|\n–3\n|\nWe discuss the most significant spending changes that were adopted in the Medi–Cal Program budget in more detail below.\nProvider Payment Reductions of Up to 10 Percent. The budget assumes $623 million in General Fund savings from reducing Medi–Cal provider payments by up to 10 percent for physicians, pharmacies, clinics, medical transportation, home health, family health programs, and other providers. The budget authorizes the director of DHCS to adjust these payment reductions based on studies of whether such reductions meet certain federal requirements. Implementation of this action requires federal approval.\nMandatory Copayments. The budget assumes $511 million in General Fund savings by imposing mandatory copayments on physician and clinic visits ($5), dental visits ($5), prescriptions ($3 for preferred drugs, $5 for non–preferred drugs), emergency and nonemergency use of emergency rooms ($50), and hospital inpatient visits ($100 per day, $200 maximum per admission). The copayments apply to all Medi–Cal enrollees and providers may deny the service if the enrollee does not make the copayment. Implementation of this action requires federal approval.\nUnallocated Reduction. The spending plan includes a $345 million unallocated reduction to the Medi–Cal Program. A large portion of the unallocated savings may be achieved through the passage of pending legislation discussed above which would impose a quality assurance fee on hospitals potentially generating $320 million in General Fund relief.\nElimination of Adult Day Health Care Benefit. The spending plan assumes elimination of Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) as an optional Medi–Cal benefit for savings of about $170 million to the General Fund. The spending plan also provides up to $85 million from the General Fund to assist ADHC beneficiaries in transitioning to other services in order to minimize the risk of institutionalization. However, the Governor vetoed legislation that would have created a new type of ADHC program, to be called the Keeping Adults Free from Institutions Program, to provide services to eligible Medi–Cal beneficiaries who are at high risk of institutionalization. The Governor instead proposed to continue efforts to transition beneficiaries who previously received ADHC into other existing home and community–based services.\nFund Shifts and One–Time Funding Sources. The budget assumes one–time fund shifts and other one–time funding sources totaling $128 million to offset General Fund spending in the Medi–Cal Program. These funds include: (1) a $45.2 million shift from the Inpatient Payment Adjustment Fund, (2) a $32.7 million shift from Private Hospital Supplemental Fund, and (3) $50.1 million from a court settlement with Quest Diagnostics Inc. to reflect the repayment of alleged overcharges for testing services. The budget does not assume that a shift of $1 billion in Proposition 10 funds approved in a March 2011 budget action will be used to support Medi–Cal as had initially been proposed.\nManaged Care Drug Rebates. The budget assumes savings of a benefit of $64 million to the General Fund from new authority to collect rebates from drug manufacturers for medications provided through Medi–Cal managed care plans.\n\"Soft Cap\" on Physician and Clinic Visits. The budget assumes $41 million in General Fund savings through a soft cap on physician and clinic visits for adults. This utilization limit of seven annual visits can be waived through a physician certification that additional visits are medically necessary.\nOther Utilization Limits and Benefit Eliminations. The budget assumes about $16 million in General Fund savings by limiting or eliminating some other Medi–Cal benefits. These changes include: (1) limiting enteral nutrition to tube feeding only for savings of almost $14 million, (2) eliminating Medi–Cal coverage for over–the–counter cold and cough products for savings of about $2 million, and (3) limiting annual hearing aid expenditures to $1,510 per person for savings of $229,000.\nState Share of Intergovernmental Transfers. Counties and district hospitals may voluntarily transfer funds to DHCS under what are known as Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs) for the purpose of providing increases in the rates paid to Medi–Cal managed care plans. The monies that counties and district hospitals transfer to the state draw down matching federal Medicaid monies, thus generating additional funding for managed care plans that ultimately is used to increase compensation for certain county– and district hospital–operated providers. Under the budget plan, entities that choose to submit these IGTs will pay a processing fee to the state equal to 20 percent of the IGTs. The estimated $34 million in fee revenues generated from this proposal will be used to offset General Fund costs in Medi–Cal.\nDepartment of Mental Health\nThe budget plan provides about $4.6 billion from all fund sources for DMH programs. This is a decrease of about $310 million, or 6.3 percent, compared to the revised prior–year spending level. Between 2010–11 and 2011–12, General Fund spending will decrease from about $1.8 billion to $1.3 billion, or about 29 percent.\nThis year–over–year decrease in General Fund support is mainly due to the one–time use of $862 million in Proposition 63 (Mental Health Services Act) funds in lieu of General Fund monies to support three community mental health programs—EPSDT, MHMC, and so–called \"AB 3632\" mental health care for special education students. Another major factor affecting net General Fund expenditures for DMH programs was the expiration of the enhanced FMAP provided under ARRA and subsequent federal legislation which provided about $167 million in General Fund relief to mental health programs in 2010–11. We discuss below the most significant spending changes included in the DMH budget.\nAdministration States Intent to Eliminate DMH and Create State Hospitals Department. In presenting its budget plan, the administration stated its intent to eventually eliminate DMH based on its rationale that this would achieve administrative efficiencies and provide more focused leadership for behavioral health services. Part of the administration's plan is to create a new Department of State Hospitals, again based on its rationale that this would improve fiscal accountability, create safer hospitals, and achieve other benefits. The administration indicated it will provide its plan to accomplish these objectives along with its 2012–13 budget proposal.\nShift of Some Mental Health Programs to DHCS. Consistent with the administration's plan to eventually eliminate DMH, the budget plan transfers administrative responsibility for EPSDT and MHMC to DHCS by June 30, 2012. The DOF must notify the Legislature regarding various aspects of the shifts, including the number and classification of the positions to be transferred and any potential fiscal effects on the programs from which resources are being transferred. Furthermore, the administration is required to provide a transition plan to the Legislature by October 1, 2011. We note that EPSDT and MHMC are included in realignment. We discuss the details of realignment elsewhere in this report.\nProposition 63 Funds Used to Support Services for Special Education Students. The budget plan uses $99 million of Proposition 63 funds on a one–time basis to pay for mental health services for special education students. In the past, these services were supported in part with a General Fund appropriation in the DMH budget. Responsibility for providing these services is being shifted from the counties to the school districts as part of realignment. We discuss this shift in more detail earlier in this chapter.\nDepartment of Developmental Services (DDS)\nThe 2011–12 budget provides $4.6 billion in total funds for DDS programs. This is a decrease of $113 million, or 2.3 percent, compared to the revised prior–year spending level. Between 2010–11 and 2011–12, General Fund spending will increase from about $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, or about 7 percent. This net year–over–year increase in General Fund support is partly due to increases in caseload and utilization of services. Another major factor affecting net General Fund expenditures for DDS programs was the expiration of the enhanced FMAP provided under ARRA and subsequent legislation, which had provided about $386 million in fiscal relief in 2010–11. Below, we discuss the most significant spending changes that were adopted in the DDS budget.\nMeasures to Contain Costs and Improve Transparency and Accountability. The budget plan achieves $284 million in savings through a combination of measures to contain costs and improve transparency and accountability. For example, costs will be contained by implementing an annual family program fee for families with incomes above 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $89,000 for a family of four in 2011). The budget plan also reflects about $110 million in savings from various measures to improve the transparency and accountability of the community services program.\nExtension of Regional Center Provider Payment Reduction. The budget plan extends a 4.25 percent provider payment reduction that has been imposed in recent years in order to achieve $92 million in savings in 2011–12.\nAssumption of Additional Federal Funds. The budget plan assumes $78 million in additional federal funds resulting from the following initiatives: (1) modifications to the state's Home and Community–Based Services program of community services for persons with disabilities ($60 million); (2) certification of Porterville Developmental Center to obtain federal Medicaid reimbursement for care provided to certain patients ($13 million), and (3) an increase in Money Follows the Person grants intended to help promote the shift of disabled persons from institutions to the community ($5 million).\nReduction in Funding for Developmental Centers (DCs). The budget plan includes several reductions to the DCs for a total of $28 million in savings. These reductions reflect the consolidation of residences and programs, reductions in funding for operations, and the elimination of funding for some DC staff.\nTrigger Reductions. As noted earlier, the final 2011–12 budget included several reductions that would only be triggered if state General Fund revenue estimates are later determined to be too high. Effective January 2012, these trigger reductions include up to $100 million in unspecified savings in services for persons with developmental disabilities.\nDepartment of Public Health (DPH)\nThe budget provides $3.5 billion from all fund sources for DPH programs. This is an increase of $188 million or about 5.6 percent compared to the revised prior–year spending level. Of this total, the spending plan provides $226 million from the General Fund for DPH, an increase of $40 million or 22 percent. This year–over–year increase is largely the result of increased General Fund support for ADAP.\nVarious Savings Measures. The budget plan includes several reductions to achieve a total of $8.3 million in General Fund savings in various public health programs. Funding reductions to Licensing and Certification, the Laboratory Field Division, the County Health Services Section, and operating expenses and equipment achieve combined savings of $4.5 million. Federal funds held in reserve for maternal and child health programs were redirected to offset $1.7 million in General Fund costs, and $1 million of General Fund support for a contract to support Valley Fever research was eliminated. The budget plan also reduces funding for the California Health Information Survey by $572,000 and for health care surge standby costs by $506,000.\nHealthy Families Program (HFP)\nThe budget plan provides $286 million from the General Fund for HFP, which is administered by MRMIB. This is a General Fund increase of $160 million, or 127 percent, compared to the revised prior–year spending level. The major factors contributing to the year–over–year increase in General Fund support are: (1) an $81 million reduction in contributions from the First 5 California Children and Families Commission used to offset General Fund costs, (2) a $64 million reduction in the availability of revenues from a tax imposed on managed care organizations (MCOs) used to offset General Fund costs in 2010–11, and (3) increased costs of $34 million associated with implementing a new type of payment system for Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Centers that serve program beneficiaries. The spending plan also reflects several measures to reduce General Fund costs in HFP below:\n- Increase in Monthly Premiums Paid by Families ($22 Million Savings). The amount of the monthly premium increases vary depending on family income levels.\n- Increase in Copayments ($6 Million). The annual copayments for each family would be limited, as under prior program rules, to $250. The copayments established for HFP generally parallel those adopted in the budget plan for the Medi–Cal Program for emergency department visits and inpatient hospital stays.\n- Reduction in the Scope of Vision Benefit ($3 Million). The budget plan eliminates support for the vision benefit provided to children enrolled in HFP, in lieu of an administration proposal to entirely eliminate the vision benefit.\nUnallocated Reduction. The spending plan includes a $103 million unallocated reduction to HFP. A proposed extension of the MCO tax described above, still under consideration by the Legislature, would provide an equivalent amount of money for the support of HFP in 2011–12.\nShift of Programs From MRMIB to DHCS. The budget plan authorizes DOF to transfer expenditure authority from MRMIB to DHCS to consolidate administrative functions for the operation of HFP and Access for Infants and Mothers Program. The DOF must notify the Legislature regarding various aspects of the shift, including the number and classification of the positions to be transferred and any potential fiscal effects on the programs from which resources are being transferred. The administration is required to provide a plan for the transfer of state administrative functions no later than December 1, 2011.\nDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Programs\nThe budget provides $631 million from all fund sources for DADP programs. This is an increase of $25 million, or about 4 percent, compared to the revised prior–year spending level. Of this total, the budget package provides $222 million from the General Fund for DADP, an increase of $33 million, or 18 percent. The General Fund increase is due, in part, to the expiration of the enhanced FMAP provided under ARRA, which provided about $17 million in fiscal relief in 2010–11. The General Fund spending level for DADP identified above for 2011–12 does not take into account the realignment of most state–supported substance abuse treatment programs to the counties. Doing so would have the effect of reducing the 2011–12 General Fund spending level by $184 million. (The realignment package is discussed in more detail earlier in this chapter.) As part of the budget plan, the administration stated its intent to eventually eliminate DADP, citing what it views as a potential for greater administrative efficiencies and more focused leadership for behavioral health services.\nDrug Medi–Cal Program Will Shift to DHCS. Consistent with the administration's plan to eventually eliminate DADP, administrative responsibility for the Drug Medi–Cal Program will be shifted to DHCS in 2011–12. The DOF must notify the Legislature regarding various aspects of the shift. Furthermore, the administration is required to provide a transition plan to the Legislature by October 1, 2011. We note that Drug Medi–Cal and some other programs administered by DADP are included in the realignment.\nCalifornia Medical Assistance Commission (CMAC)\nThe budget plan requires CMAC to be dissolved after June 30, 2012. All of CMAC's powers, duties, and responsibilities would be transferred to the Director of DHCS along with CMAC executive and staff positions.\nSocial Services\nOverview of Total Spending Excluding Realignment. General Fund support for social services programs in 2011–12 totals $9.1 billion, an increase of about $80 million, or 0.9 percent, compared to the revised prior–year level. This modest increase is due to higher costs in county administration and automation and the child welfare system, partially offset by reductions in Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program (SSI/SSP) grants. Figure 13 shows the change in General Fund spending in each major social services program and department, excluding the impact of realignment.\nFigure 13\nMajor Social Services Programs and Departments\nGeneral Fund (Dollars in Millions)\n|\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\nChange\n|\n|\nAmount\n|\nPercent\n|\n|\nSupplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program\n|\n$2,860.8\n|\n$2,752.2\n|\n–$108.7\n|\n–3.8%\n|\n|\nCalifornia Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids\n|\n2,079.2\n|\n2,072.3\n|\n–6.9\n|\n–0.3\n|\n|\nIn–Home Supportive Servicesa\n|\n1,343.2\n|\n1,380.3\n|\n37.1\n|\n2.8\n|\n|\nChild welfare systemb\n|\n1,510.3\n|\n1,590.8\n|\n80.6\n|\n5.3\n|\n|\nCounty Administration/Automation\n|\n607.5\n|\n671.8\n|\n64.3\n|\n10.6\n|\n|\nDepartment of Child Support Services\n|\n335.2\n|\n321.6\n|\n–13.6\n|\n–4.1\n|\n|\nDepartment of Rehabilitation\n|\n54.1\n|\n55.1\n|\n1.0\n|\n1.9\n|\n|\nDepartment of Aging\n|\n32.8\n|\n32.5\n|\n–0.3\n|\n–0.8\n|\n|\nAll other social services (including state support)\n|\n215.7\n|\n240.5\n|\n24.9\n|\n11.5\n|\n|\nTotalsa\n|\n$9,038.7\n|\n$9,117.2\n|\n$78.4\n|\n0.9%\n|\n|\nEstimated realignment savingsc\n|\n—\n|\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\nThe Impact of Social Services Realignment on General Fund Spending. Budget legislation realigns 100 percent of most child welfare system costs, 100 percent of APS costs and about 34 percent of CalWORKs costs to counties. Under this realignment, General Fund support for these programs will be replaced by 2011 realignment special fund spending. After accounting for realignment, General Fund spending for social services programs in 2011–12 is reduced by about $2.7 billion, almost 30 percent below the revised spending level for 2010–11. The 2011 realignment plan is discussed in more detail earlier in this chapter.\nSummary of Major Changes. Figure 14 shows the major General Fund changes adopted by the Legislature for social services programs. Most of the budget reductions were in the CalWORKs, In–Home Supportive Services (IHSS), and SSI/SSP programs. Absent the changes shown in the figure, total General Fund spending for social services programs in 2011–12 would have been almost $1.5 billion higher. Below, we discuss the major changes in each program area.\nFigure 14\nMajor Changes—Social Services Programs2011–12 General Fund Effect\n(In Millions)\n|\nProgram\n|\nAmount\n|\n|\nCalWORKs\n|\n|\n|\nExtend two–year county block grant reduction for an additional year\n|\n–$369.4\n|\n|\nReduce grants by 8 percent\n|\n–314.3\n|\n|\nEstablish 48–month time limit for adults\n|\n–102.9\n|\n|\nReduce earned income disregard\n|\n–83.3\n|\n|\nSuspend Cal–Learn services for teen parents\n|\n–43.6\n|\n|\nLimit license–exempt child care reimbursements to 60 percent\n|\n–30.6\n|\n|\nEliminate community challenge grants\n|\n–20.0\n|\n|\nReduce allocations for substance abuse/mental health and automation\n|\n–10.0\n|\n|\nRepeal sanctions and time limits originally scheduled for July 2011\n|\n135.0\n|\n|\nIn–Home Supportive Services\n|\n|\n|\nAchieve long–term care savings through medication dispensing devices\n|\n–$140.0\n|\n|\nObtain additional federal funding through Community First Choice option\n|\n–128.0\n|\n|\nMake health certification a condition of eligibility\n|\n–67.4\n|\n|\nReflect savings from lower than anticipated caseload\n|\n–53.7\n|\n|\nEnd mandate for advisory committees\n|\n–1.5\n|\n|\nHold public authorities and counties harmless from caseload decline\n|\n7.1\n|\n|\nSupplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program\n|\n|\n|\nReduce grants to federal minimum for individuals\n|\n–$183.4\n|\n|\nFoster Care\n|\n|\n|\nShift responsibility for seriously emotionally disturbed children to schools\n|\n–$68.0\n|\n|\nReflect additional cost of court–imposed rate increase\n|\n17.4\n|\n|\nCounty Administration and Automation\n|\n|\n|\nDelay Los Angeles county welfare system procurement\n|\n–$13.0\n|\n|\nSuspend child welfare system procurement\n|\n–3.0\n|\n|\nDepartment of Child Support Services\n|\n|\n|\nSuspend county share of collections (revenue)\n|\n–$24.0\n|\n|\nDepartment of Aging\n|\n|\n|\nReduce Multipurpose Senior Services Program\n|\n–$2.5\n|\n|\nTotal\n|\n|\nCalWORKs\nThe budget provides $2.1 billion for the CalWORKs program in 2011–12, which is unchanged from the revised level of spending in the prior year. This amount does not include the impact of the 2011 realignment legislation, which shifts about $1.1 billion in CalWORKs grant costs to the counties. Absent the major policy changes described below, CalWORKs spending would have increased by over $800 million.\nExtension of County Block Grant Reduction and Exemptions for One Year. For 2009–10 and 2010–11, the Legislature reduced the county block grants for welfare–to–work services and child care by approximately $375 million each year. These reductions were accompanied by additional exemptions of CalWORKs recipients from work participation requirements which allowed counties to manage the reduction by not providing services to the exempted families. The budget extends the block grant reduction and the exemptions for one additional year. After accounting for certain grant costs associated with the exemptions, this extension results in one–time savings of almost $370 million.\nEight Percent Grant Reduction. Effective July 1, 2011, budget legislation reduces maximum monthly grants by 8 percent, resulting in ongoing annual General Fund savings of about $314 million. Figure 15 shows the maximum monthly grant and CalFresh (formerly known as Food Stamps) benefits for a family of three in both high– and low–cost counties. As the figure shows, the net decrease in total monthly benefits is about $40. Recipients in high–cost counties will receive total benefits equal to 72 percent of the federal poverty guideline. For low–cost counties, the total benefits are at 71 percent of the guideline.\nFigure 15\nCalWORKs Maximum Monthly Grant and CalFresh BenefitsFamily of Three\n|\n|\nJanuary 2011\n|\nJuly 2011\n|\nChange\n|\n|\nAmount\n|\nPercent\n|\n|\nHigh–Cost Counties\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGrant\n|\n$694\n|\n$638\n|\n–$56\n|\n–8%\n|\n|\nCalFresh benefitsa\n|\n460\n|\n476\n|\n16\n|\n3\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$1,154\n|\n$1,114\n|\n–$40\n|\n–3%\n|\n|\nPercent of Poverty\n|\n75%\n|\n72%\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLow–Cost Counties\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGrant\n|\n$661\n|\n$608\n|\n–$53\n|\n–8%\n|\n|\nCalFresh benefitsa\n|\n470\n|\n484\n|\n14\n|\n3\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$1,131\n|\n$1,092\n|\n–$39\n|\n–3%\n|\n|\nPercent of Poverty\n|\n73%\n|\n71%\n|\n|\n|\nReduced Time Limit for Aided Adults. Budget legislation reduces from 60 to 48 the number of months that an adult may receive cash benefits. Although adults will be removed from the calculation of the family's grant, children will continue to receive aid in a program informally known as the \"safety net.\" The shorter time limit results in combined grant and county block grant savings of $103 million each year. Budget legislation also repealed prior laws which would have instituted shorter time limits and deeper sanctions in July 2011. This repeal results in foregone savings of about $135 million.\nReduction in Earned Income Disregard. Under prior law, California \"disregarded\" (did not count) the first $225 of monthly income and 50 percent of each dollar earned beyond $225 when calculating a family's monthly grant. This policy provides a work incentive for families. Budget legislation modifies the grant calculation so that only the first $112 of earned income and 50 percent of each dollar earned above that amount will be disregarded. This change in the disregard policy results in ongoing savings of about $83 million annually.\nOne–Year Suspension of Cal–Learn Program. The Cal–Learn program provides intensive case management to about 12,000 teen parents who remain in school. Depending on school performance, the teens may earn bonuses and sanctions. Budget legislation suspends the case management component of the program for one year, resulting in General Fund savings of $44 million.\nReduction in Child Care Reimbursements. Under prior law, the state would reimburse license–exempt child care providers up to 80 percent of the regional market rate (RMR) ceiling. Effective July 1, 2011, the maximum reimbursement rate is reduced to 60 percent of the RMR. This results in CalWORKs child care savings of $31 million and additional savings within CDE's child care budget.\nOther Reductions. The budget eliminated $20 million provided to DPH for the Community Challenge Grant project. This program aimed to reduce adolescent and unwed pregnancies while encouraging father–child involvement. The budget also reduced funding for substance abuse/mental health treatment and welfare automation by a total of $10 million.\nIn–Home Supportive Services\nThe 2011–12 budget provides about $1.4 billion from the General Fund for support of the IHSS program. This represents an increase of 2.8 percent for the program in 2011–12 over the revised prior–year level of spending. Funding for IHSS has experienced relatively slower growth than in the past due to reductions in the program. Below, we describe the major changes included in the 2011–12 budget for IHSS.\nCommunity First Choice Option. The 2011–12 budget assumes that the state will qualify for additional federal funding available to states under the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as the federal health care reform legislation. This additional federal funding would be used to offset the General Fund costs for IHSS. Specifically, if California meets federal regulations still under development, the Community First Choice option could increase the federal share of costs of the IHSS program by 6 percentage points. (Until now, the federal government has generally paid 50 percent of program costs.) It is estimated that implementing this option would save $128 million in the budget year. Future savings would depend on the overall spending in the program and the extent to which California can draw down these new federal funds.\nElimination of IHSS for Recipients Without a Health Certificate. Effective August 2011, the budget eliminates IHSS services for recipients lacking certification that indicates that, without IHSS, they would be at risk of out–of–home placement. The certificate must be signed by a licensed health care professional such as a physician, physician assistant, or public health nurse. The budget assumes that 10 percent of current and future recipients will not obtain the health certificate, and will therefore lose IHSS eligibility. After accounting for administrative implementation costs, this eligibility change is estimated to save $67 million in the budget year and over $120 million when fully implemented.\nMedication Compliance and Budget Cut Trigger. As part of the 2011–12 budget, the Legislature implemented a medication dispensing pilot program. By providing automated medication dispensing machines, the program is intended to improve medication compliance for Medicaid recipients who are at high risk of nursing home placement, hospital admission, and emergency room usage. Based on anticipated improvement in medication compliance, the budget plan assumes that the state will avoid $140 million in health care costs at skilled nursing facilities, hospitals, and emergency rooms in 2011–12. Since the savings are expected to reduce health care costs, they would occur in the Medi–Cal budget rather than the Department of Social Services (DSS) budget.\nBeginning October 1, 2011, budget legislation requires DHCS to provide quarterly reports to DOF on the implementation of these activities. If the DOF determines that the medication pilot project will not achieve $140 million in annual savings, it must notify the Legislature of its conclusion by April 10, 2012. The Legislature then has until July 1, 2012 to enact legislation to modify the pilot project or to implement other options to achieve the ongoing savings beginning in 2012–13. If, after July 1, 2012, the DOF determines that the Legislature's additional actions will still not achieve $140 million in savings, budget legislation authorizes an across–the–board reduction in IHSS hours for 2012–13 sufficient to ensure that the savings, coupled with any savings from the pilot project, reach $140 million. We note that the across–the–board reduction has certain exemptions and processes in place for hour restorations for recipients who find that the reduction will put them at risk of out–of–home placement.\nSlower–Than–Anticipated Caseload Growth. The budget reflects estimated savings of $54 million in 2011–12 based on more recent data which show lower than estimated caseload growth.\nFunding for Public Authorities and County Administration. The 2011–12 budget includes $7.1 million in funding to hold county and public authority administrative allocations to the levels provided as of March 2011. Absent this legislative action, funding for counties and public authorities would have declined by an equivalent amount. Additionally, the Legislature adopted uncodified budget legislation requiring the department to work with the public authorities to develop a new rate–setting methodology for public authorities.\nTrigger Reductions. As noted earlier, the final 2011–12 budget included several reductions that would only be triggered if certain revenue estimates are later determined to be incorrect. Effective January 2012, these trigger reductions include (1) up to $100 million in savings from a 20 percent across–the–board reduction to IHSS hours and (2) the elimination of up to $10 million in funding for local antifraud activities. Similar to the medication compliance across–the–board reduction, budget legislation allows for certain exemptions and processes for hour restorations if recipients find that the across–the–board reduction puts them at risk of out–of–home placement.\nSupplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program\nThe budget provides $2.8 billion from the General Fund for SSI/SSP. This is an overall decrease of $109 million, or 4 percent, in funding compared to the revised 2010–11 spending level. This decrease is primarily due to grant reductions for individuals receiving SSI/SSP. These savings are partially offset by an increase in the program caseload.\nGrant Reduction. Effective July 2011, the budget reduces SSI/SSP grants for individuals to the minimum amount allowable under federal law. The SSI/SSP grants for couples were reduced to the federal minimum as part of the 2009–10 Budget Act. The savings from this new reduction are estimated to be $183.4 million in 2011–12. As seen in Figure 16, this action reduces maximum monthly grants for individuals by $15 (1.7 percent).\nFigure 16\nSSI/SSP Maximum Monthly Grants\n|\n|\nPriorLevels\n|\nJuly2011\n|\n|\nIndividuals\n|\n|\n|\n|\nSSI\n|\n$674\n|\n$674\n|\n|\nSSP\n|\n171\n|\n156\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$845\n|\n$830\n|\n|\nPercent of Povertya\n|\n93%\n|\n91%\n|\n|\nCouples\n|\n|\n|\n|\nSSI\n|\n$1,011\n|\n$1,011\n|\n|\nSSP\n|\n396\n|\n396\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$1,407\n|\n$1,407\n|\n|\nPercent of Povertya\n|\n115%\n|\n115%\n|\nFoster Care and Child Welfare Services\nThe budget includes about $1.6 billion from the General Fund for children's programs, an increase of 5.3 percent from revised 2010–11 spending levels. This increase is primarily due to backfilling for the phase–out of federal ARRA funds, a technical shift of certain costs from CalWORKs to Foster Care, and a rate increase (described below). These budget totals do not reflect the impact of realigning 100 percent of most child welfare costs to the counties. The realignment proposal is discussed in more detail earlier in this chapter.\nCourt–Ordered Foster Family Home (FFH) Rate Increase. In May 2011, the U.S. District Court ordered DSS to immediately increase FFH rates based on a new rate methodology developed by DSS at the direction of the court. The new methodology results in an average rate increase of 31 percent for current FFH cases and for future cases in the Adoption Assistance Program (AAP), Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payment (Kin–GAP), federal Kin–GAP, and Non–Related Legal Guardian programs. The court also ordered that rates be increased each year in accordance with the California Necessities Index (CNI). The 2011–12 budget reflects all of the above changes, including a 1.92 percent CNI COLA for all current and future cases effective July 1, 2011. The General Fund cost of these changes is $17 million. Figure 17 displays the new FFH rates implemented in May and the 2011–12 rates, including the CNI COLA.\nFigure 17\nRevised Monthly Foster Family Home Rates\n|\nChild's Age\n|\nPrior Law\n|\nMay 2011\n|\nJuly 2011a\n|\n|\n0 – 4\n|\n$446\n|\n$609\n|\n$621\n|\n|\n5 – 8\n|\n485\n|\n660\n|\n673\n|\n|\n9 – 11\n|\n519\n|\n695\n|\n708\n|\n|\n12 – 14\n|\n573\n|\n727\n|\n741\n|\n|\n15 – 19\n|\n627\n|\n761\n|\n776\n|\nRepeal of AB 3632 Mandate for Seriously Emotionally Disturbed (SED) Children. Budget legislation repeals the mandate requiring DSS and county welfare departments to provide board and care for so–called AB 3632 SED children. Local school districts are instead responsible for their out–of–home placement. This change results in a decrease of $68 million in DSS board and care and administration costs, with a comparable cost increase in Proposition 98 funding. The education section of this report provides a further discussion of these actions.\nCounty Welfare Automation Projects\nSuspension of Child Welfare Services Project. The Child Welfare Services/Case Management System Web (CWS/Web) project would build a modern, web–based system to replace the current system, which is based on outdated technology and does not fully comply with federal system requirements. Project staff planned to select a vendor and begin development work by late 2012–13 at a cost of about $70 million (all funds) annually for several years. Because the federal government is revising its requirements for such systems and escalating project costs, the Legislature suspended development of the CWS/Web project and canceled the current procurement. General Fund support for the project in the 2011–12 was reduced by $3 million, leaving $1 million for shutdown activities. In addition, trailer bill language directs DSSand the Office of Systems Integration, after consulting with stakeholders, to report by January 10, 2012 to the Legislature on (1) the current system's ability to support CWS practice, (2) the best approach to address missing functionality in the system, and (3) any next steps for implementing this approach, among other issues.\nLos Angeles Project Delay. The Los Angeles Eligibility, Automated Determination, Evaluation and Reporting (LEADER) replacement system is one of three county–led consortia that make up the statewide automated welfare system. The LEADER system is nearing the end of its useful life and procurement of a replacement system has been under way for several years. The consortium recently selected a vendor to build the new system at an estimated total cost of $485 million over the next four years. The administration proposed to indefinitely suspend the replacement project due to its high cost and indications that the federal government would not participate in funding its development until a long–term strategic plan for its three automated welfare systems was submitted and approved. Rather than indefinitely suspend development, the Legislature delayed the replacement project and reduced General Fund support by $14 million in 2010–11 and $13 million in 2011–12.\nDepartment of Child Support Services\nSuspension of County Share of Collections. Typically, when Local Child Support Agencies collect child support on behalf of families receiving CalWORKs, the county retains a portion (2.5 percent) of the collections. Most counties use these funds for the support of their CalWORKs programs. The 2011–12 budget package suspends the county share of collections for one year, which results in an increase in General Fund revenue of about $24 million in the budget year.\nDepartment of Aging\nThe budget provides $33 million from the General Fund for the Department of Aging, a l percent decrease in funding compared to the revised 2010–11 funding level. Savings from a reduction in the Multipurpose Senior Services Program are largely offset by expiration of federal ARRA funding, which had previously been used to offset General Fund costs.\nReduction for Multipurpose Senior Services Program. In January, the Governor proposed the elimination of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP). The Legislature instead reduced General Fund support for MSSP by $2.5 million (about 13 percent) in 2011–12. Additionally, the Legislature adopted budget bill language requiring the Department of Aging to work with the federal government to reduce MSSP administration costs to help limit reductions in the number of recipients served by the program.\nCalifornia Children and Families Commission\nFund Sweep Not Reflected in Budget. Chapter 4, Statutes of 2011 (AB 99, Committee on Budget), redirected $1 billion in funding from the California Children and Families Commission—also known as the First 5 Commission, originally established by Proposition 10 in 1998—to offset General Fund–supported Medi–Cal costs for children up to age five. Chapter 4 requires local county commissions to transfer $950 million and the state commission to contribute the remaining $50 million. Several local First 5 commissions have challenged the legality of the fund sweep in court. The 2011–12 Medi–Cal budget does not assume any offset of costs with First 5 funding. However, the administration has indicated that it will defend the legal challenge in court.\nJudiciary and Criminal Justice\nThe 2011–12 budget provides $12.3 billion from the General Fund for judicial and criminal justice programs, including support for ongoing programs and capital outlay projects (see Figure 18). This is an increase of $286 million, or 2.4 percent, above the revised 2010–11 General Fund spending level. As discussed in the \"Realignment\" section of this chapter, the realignment of various criminal justice responsibilities from the state to local governments is estimated to reduce General Fund costs for criminal justice programs by almost $1.5 billion, thereby bringing the adjusted total for General Fund expenditures for these purposes in 2011–12 to about $10.8 billion. Figure 19 summarizes the major General Fund changes adopted by the Legislature in the criminal justice area, which we discuss in more detail below.\nFigure 18\nJudicial and Criminal Justice Budget Summary\nGeneral Fund (Dollars in Millions)\n|\nProgram/Department\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\nChange From 2010–11\n|\n|\nAmount\n|\nPercent\n|\n|\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation\n|\n$7,952\n|\n$9,491\n|\n$9,833\n|\n$342\n|\n3.6%\n|\n|\nJudicial Branch\n|\n614\n|\n1,662\n|\n1,715\n|\n53\n|\n3.2\n|\n|\nDepartment of Justice\n|\n317\n|\n292\n|\n233\n|\n–59\n|\n–20.2\n|\n|\nOther criminal justice programsa\n|\n495\n|\n534\n|\n484\n|\n–50\n|\n–9.4\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$9,378\n|\n$11,979\n|\n$12,266\n|\n$286\n|\n2.4%\n|\n|\nProgram funding temporarily paid from federal funds and local government finance shift\n|\n$2,457\n|\n$350\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\nEstimated realignment savings\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n–$1,496b\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\nJudicial Branch\nThe budget provides about $4 billion for support of the judicial branch—a decrease of $59 million, or 1.5 percent, from the revised 2010–11 level. This amount includes $1.7 billion from the General Fund and $499 million from the counties, with most of the remaining balance of about $1.8 billion derived from fine, penalty, and court fee revenues. The General Fund amount is a net increase of about $53 million, or 3.2 percent, from the revised 2010–11 amount. (The $1.2 billion figure does not reflect the estimated General Fund savings from the realignment of court security to county sheriffs.) Funding for trial court operations is the single largest component of the judicial branch budget, accounting for over 80 percent of total spending.\nCourt Operations. The budget package includes a $403 million General Fund augmentation to the budget of the judicial branch. This is primarily to replace redevelopment funds that were used on a one–time basis in 2010–11 to offset General Fund costs for trial courts, as well as to support increased employee compensation costs. However, a significant portion of this increase is offset by a largely unallocated reduction of $350 million to the judicial branch. Under the budget plan, part of the reduction will be accommodated in 2011–12 through the one–time redirection of $170 million from various special funds (such as court construction funds).\nCourts Capital Outlay. The budget also reflects a one–time transfer of $310 million from the Immediate and Critical Needs Account (ICNA) to the General Fund. (In accordance to Chapter 311, Statutes of 2008 [SB 1407, Perata], the ICNA receives revenue from certain court fee and fine increases to support 40 court construction projects.) As a result of this transfer to the General Fund, most of the planned court construction projects that would be supported by ICNA will be delayed by about a year.\nCorrections and Rehabilitation\nThe budget contains $9.8 billion from the General Fund for support of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). This is a net increase of $342 million, or 3.6 percent, above the revised 2010–11 level of spending. (This figure does not reflect the estimated General Fund savings from the realignment of certain lower–level offenders, parole violators, and parolees to local governments.) As discussed earlier in this report, if state General Fund revenues are forecast to fall $1 billion below the level assumed in the 2011–12 Budget Act, various General Fund expenditure reductions would be triggered, including a $20 million unallocated reduction to CDCR's budget. Under these circumstances, counties would also be required to pay $125,000 per year to the state for each juvenile offender committed to the Division of Juvenile Facilities (DJF), resulting in an assumed savings of $72 million in the General Fund cost of operating state youth correctional facilities.\nAdult Correctional Population. Figure 20 shows the recent changes and projected declines in the inmate and parolee populations. As shown in the figure, these populations are expected to decline significantly starting in 2011–12 due largely to the effect of the realignment plan, such as the shift of responsibility for certain adult offenders to counties. For example, the realignment plan is expected to reduce the inmate population by about 14,000 inmates in 2011–12. (Please see the \"Realignment\" section of this report for a more detailed discussion of that plan.)\nAdditional Funding to Address CDCR Budget Shortfalls. The budget includes an additional $380 million in General Fund support for CDCR for ongoing annual operating costs that the department indicates have exceeded its budget authority in previous years. For example, correctional officer, sergeant, and lieutenant positions have traditionally been budgeted based on the middle step of each position's salary range. However, CDCR reports that the average officer in these positions actually earns closer to the top step of the salary range. Of the $380 million total augmentation, $267 million was provided to make such adjustments related to the costs for the department's security staff. The remainder of the augmentation is in response to increased costs for medical guarding and transportation, correctional officer overtime, legal expenses, and inmate housing.\nInmate Health Care Services. The budget includes a total General Fund augmentation of $28 million for compliance with federal court orders and settlements, such as medical services under the Plata case and mental health services under the Coleman case. This amount includes $12 million for about 211 additional nursing positions to distribute medication to inmates, and $15 million for the planning and activation of various new health care facilities. However, the budget also reflects $81 million in General Fund savings from an unallocated reduction of about 5 percent in the federal Receiver's inmate medical services program. The Receiver intends to achieve these savings by seeking federal reimbursement for inpatient health care delivered to inmates in community hospitals who are eligible for Medi–Cal and carrying out other unspecified operational and policy changes. In addition, the budget includes a $46 million decrease to reflect a reduction in projected pharmaceutical expenditures.\nCDCR \"Workforce Cap\" Savings. The budget plan assumes $195 million in savings as a result of an unallocated reduction to CDCR's personnel budget. The department plans to achieve these savings through various measures, such as reducing headquarters positions, closing one DJF facility, reducing security staffing at the prisons, and increasing the number of parolees each parole agent supervises.\nAdult Correctional Rehabilitation and Other Programs. The budget includes a one–time reduction of $101 million to inmate and parolee rehabilitation programs. The department plans to achieve these savings primarily by delaying implementation of new contracts for sex offender treatment programs and female offender programs, reducing operating expenses and equipment for education programs, and reducing substance abuse treatment capacity for inmates and parolees. In addition, the budget includes $89 million to provide community corrections performance incentive grants to county probation departments that successfully send fewer probationers to state prison. In accordance with Chapter 608, Statutes of 2010 (SB 678, Leno), this funding reflects a portion of the state savings from having a reduced prison population.\nCorrections Standards Authority (CSA). The budget package eliminates the CSA and assigns its former duties to a new 12–member Board of State and Community Corrections. Unlike CSA, this new board will be independent of CDCR. The primary goals of the new board will be to assist other state and local government agencies in implementing the criminal justice realignment plan discussed above, provide leadership in the area of criminal justice policy, and to develop data and information related to the implementation of outcome–based measures and evidence–based practices in community corrections efforts.\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ)\nThe budget includes $233 million from the General Fund for support of DOJ, a net reduction of about $59 million, or 20 percent, from the revised 2010–11 level. The budget shifts $50 million from DOJ to various state agencies in order to implement a \"billable–services\" model for the legal services that these agencies receive from DOJ. Under this new model, state agencies will reimburse DOJ for its services. The budget also reflects $37 million in savings from a reduction in state support for DOJ's Division of Law Enforcement. These reductions are partially offset by increased funding for state forensic laboratories ($14 million) and employee compensation costs ($13 million).\nOffice of the Inspector General (OIG)\nThe budget includes about $21 million from the General Fund to support OIG, a reduction of $3.8 million, or 15.5 percent, from the revised 2010–11 level. This reflects savings expected from policy changes specified in budget trailer legislation that reduce the duties and responsibilities of the OIG.\nResources and Environmental Protection\nThe 2011–12 budget provides about $7.3 billion from various fund sources for programs administered by the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Agencies. This is a decrease of $3.8 billion, or 34 percent, when compared to revised 2010–11 expenditures. Most of this decrease reflects lower bond expenditures in 2011–12, although the budget still includes a major infusion (around $1.4 billion) of available bond funds from various resources–related measures. The budgets also include a combined $2 billion from the General Fund.\nFigures 21 and 22 compare expenditure totals for resources and environmental protection programs in 2009–10, 2010–11, and 2011–12. As the figures show, General Fund expenditures are somewhat lower in 2011–12. This reduction reflects (1) a partial shift in funding from the General Fund to fees for wildland fire prevention ($50 million) and for water quality and water rights activities ($24 million), (2) a $44 million reduction in CalFire's fire protection program, (3) a partial shift in funding of $16 million from the General Fund to bond funds for flood management, and (4) an $11 million reduction in state park operations. Debt service on general obligation bonds continues to be the largest single General Fund expenditure in the resources and environmental protection areas—totaling $942 million in 2011–12. The significant decrease in local assistance and capital outlay for resources and environmental protection programs is largely due to reduced bond expenditures.\nFigure 21\nResources Programs: Expenditures and Funding\n(Dollars in Millions)\n|\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\nChange From 2010–11 to 2011–12\n|\n|\nAmount\n|\nPercent\n|\n|\nExpenditures\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nState operations\n|\n$4,449.6\n|\n$5,329.4\n|\n$4,638.6\n|\n–$690.8\n|\n–13.0%\n|\n|\nLocal assistance\n|\n426.9\n|\n2,060.2\n|\n701.0\n|\n–1,359.2\n|\n–66.0\n|\n|\nCapital outlay\n|\n340.2\n|\n1,944.2\n|\n264.6\n|\n–1,679.6\n|\n–86.4\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$5,216.7\n|\n$9,333.8\n|\n$5,604.2\n|\n–$3,729.6\n|\n–40.0%\n|\n|\nFunding\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGeneral Fund\n|\n$1,800.2\n|\n$1,989.9\n|\n$1,946.4\n|\n–$43.5\n|\n–2.2%\n|\n|\nSpecial funds\n|\n2,122.1\n|\n2,525.6\n|\n2,377.3\n|\n–148.3\n|\n–5.9\n|\n|\nBond funds\n|\n867.0\n|\n4,479.7\n|\n1,000.2\n|\n–3,479.5\n|\n–77.7\n|\n|\nFederal funds\n|\n427.4\n|\n338.6\n|\n280.3\n|\n–58.3\n|\n–17.2\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$5,216.7\n|\n$9,333.8\n|\n$5,604.2\n|\n–$3,729.6\n|\n–40.0%\n|\nFigure 22\nEnvironmental Protection Programs:Expenditures and Funding\n(Dollars in Millions)\n|\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\nChange From 2010–11 to 2011–12\n|\n|\nAmount\n|\nPercent\n|\n|\nExpenditures\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nState operations\n|\n$1,131.6\n|\n$1,449.1\n|\n$1,453.9\n|\n$4.8\n|\n0.3%\n|\n|\nLocal assistance\n|\n202.7\n|\n318.0\n|\n214.7\n|\n–103.3\n|\n–32.5\n|\n|\nCapital outlay\n|\n—\n|\n0.2\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.4\n|\n700.0\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$1,334.3\n|\n$1,767.3\n|\n$1,670.2\n|\n–$97.1\n|\n–5.4%\n|\n|\nFunding\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGeneral Fund\n|\n$61.0\n|\n$75.2\n|\n$50.9\n|\n–$24.3\n|\n–32.3%\n|\n|\nSpecial funds\n|\n828.4\n|\n1,072.5\n|\n1,049.9\n|\n–22.6\n|\n–2.1\n|\n|\nBond funds\n|\n215.3\n|\n421.5\n|\n369.0\n|\n–52.5\n|\n–12.5\n|\n|\nFederal funds\n|\n229.6\n|\n198.1\n|\n200.4\n|\n2.3\n|\n1.2\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$1,334.3\n|\n$1,767.3\n|\n$1,670.2\n|\n–$97.1\n|\n–5.4%\n|\nResources and Environmental Protection Expenditures\nBond Expenditure Summary. The budget includes about $1.4 billion from a number of bond funds (mainly Propositions 50, 84, 1B, and 1E) for various resources and environmental protection programs. The largest set of bond expenditures in 2011–12 are for state and local parks (primarily local parks).\nDelta–Related Expenditures. The budget provides a total of $272 million in state funds (mainly bond funds) across nine state agencies to address a number of interrelated water problems in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta region. These expenditures are coordinated and overseen by the relatively new Delta Stewardship Council, which was established pursuant to Chapter 5, Statutes of 2009 (SBX7 1, Simitian), to manage the state's interests in the Delta. The largest program expenditures are for improvements to the existing conveyance system ($98 million) and ecosystem restoration ($80 million).\nClimate Change. The budget includes $37 million from special funds across eight state agencies for implementation of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 [AB 32, Núñez]), to reduce the state's emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to 1990 levels by 2020. Figure 23 lists the expenditures, number of positions, funding sources, and activities funded on an agency–by–agency basis for the implementation of AB 32 in 2011–12. These expenditures include about $9 million for the Air Resources Board (ARB) to finish developing and begin implementation of its cap–and–trade regulation. The balance of the expenditures is to be used mainly to develop and implement other measures to reduce GHG emissions, as well as for programmatic oversight and interdepartmental coordination. As shown in the figure, the primary funding source for AB 32 implementation is the \"AB 32 fee\" that the ARB began assessing in 2010–11 on major GHG emitters subject to state regulation. Over the next several years, revenues from this new fee will also be used to repay loans made from various special funds that were the major means of support for AB 32 implementation from 2007–08 through 2009–10. Although not reflected in the figure, there are also expenditures in other departments that, while not funded by the AB 32 fee, nonetheless serve to help meet the state's AB 32 goals. These include expenditures of the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission to implement the state's Renewables Portfolio Standard and various energy efficiency programs.\nFigure 23\nAB 32 Implementation in 2011–12\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n|\nAgency\n|\nPositions\n|\nExpenditures\n|\nFund Source\n|\nActivity\n|\n|\nAir Resources Board\n|\n155\n|\n$32,932\n|\nAB 32 fee revenue in Air Pollution Control Fund (APCF)\n|\nDevelop and implement GHG emission reduction measures such as cap–and–trade program.\n|\n|\nSecretary for Environmental Protection\n|\n6\n|\n1,807\n|\nAB 32 fee revenue in APCF, Motor Vehicle Account, General Fund\n|\nClimate Action Team activities, including program oversight and coordination.\n|\n|\nDepartment of Water Resources\n|\n3\n|\n551\n|\nAB 32 fee revenue in APCF, State Water Project (SWP) funds\n|\nEvaluate impact of climate change on state's water supply and flood control systems; SWP climate change/energy program activities.\n|\n|\nState Water Resources Control Board\n|\n2\n|\n535\n|\nAB 32 fee revenue in APCF\n|\nDevelop GHG emission reduction measures.\n|\n|\nDepartment of Resources Recycling and Recovery\n|\n6\n|\n501\n|\nAB 32 fee revenue in APCF\n|\nDevelop and implement GHG emission reduction measures.\n|\n|\nDepartment of General Services\n|\n5\n|\n416\n|\nService Revolving Fund\n|\nImplement Green Building Initiative and Sustainability Program.\n|\n|\nDepartment of Public Health\n|\n—\n|\n323\n|\nAB 32 fee revenue in APCF\n|\nDevelop GHG emission reduction measures.\n|\n|\nDepartment of Housing and Community Development\n|\n1\n|\n98\n|\nAB 32 fee revenue in APCF\n|\nDevelop GHG emission reduction measures.\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n178\n|\n$37,163\n|\n|\n|\nAssembly Bill 118–Funded Programs. The budget includes (1) $106 million for financial incentives administered by the Energy Commission to advance alternative and renewable fuel vehicle technologies and (2) $44 million for the ARB to provide grants and loans to owners of heavy–duty diesel vehicles to retrofit vehicles to achieve early compliance with regulations requiring reductions in emissions of air pollutants and GHGs. These expenditures are funded from various charges (smog abatement, vehicle registration, and vessel registration) raised pursuant to Chapter 750, Statutes of 2007 (AB 118, Núñez).\nCalFire. The budget includes $121 million in a General Fund budget item that is designated specifically for emergency fire protection. The Director of Finance can augment this amount to pay for additional fire protection expenses, as needed. The budget also includes $524 million for separate budget items to support CalFire operations. This total reflects $44 million in General Fund savings from program reductions, of which $31 million results from changing staffing levels back to the pre–2003 level of three firefighters per engine instead of four. The budget also establishes a wildland firefighting working group to discuss future funding, realignment, and possible changes to the state's management of wildland firefighting.\nThe General Fund total also reflects the revenues raised from a new fire prevention fee to be assessed on property owners residing in State Responsibility Areas (SRAs)—mostly privately owned rangelands, timberlands, and watershed areas for which the state is responsible for providing wildland fire protection. The fee—to be assessed at up to $150 per inhabitable structure within an SRA—is projected to realize $50 million in General Fund savings in 2011–12 and $200 million in ongoing General Fund savings beginning in 2012–13.\nState Parks General Fund Support. The budget provides $119 million from the General Fund for state park operations—reflecting an $11 million reduction in the Department of Parks and Recreation's (DPR's) base level of General Fund support. (The budget plan reflects an additional $11 million ongoing reduction beginning in 2012–13.) This programmatic reduction will be met through immediate service reductions and, beginning July 2012, the closure of up to 70 state parks. The Legislature directed DPR to select parks for closure based on several factors, including: rate of visitation, net savings from closure, existence of (or potential for) partnerships for the support of a park unit, relative statewide significance of a unit identified in department documents, significant and costly infrastructure deficiencies, and feasibility of physical closure of a park unit.\nWilliamson Act Subventions. The budget does not provide financial relief to counties for implementing Williamson Act contracts in 2011–12. This state subvention program allows counties to partially defray the loss of property tax revenues they incur by entering into open space contracts with landowners. The Legislature also approved the Governor's proposal to reverse a $10 million appropriation provided for 2010–11 for the Williamson Act subvention program.\nEnergy Expenditures\nUse of Gas Consumption Surcharge Monies. The budget provides $453 million for various natural gas–related energy programs, funded from the Gas Consumption Surcharge, which is assessed on natural gas ratepayers. While the budget reflects $612 million in available resources from the Gas Consumption Surcharge in 2011–12, the Legislature made a programmatic cut of $155 million to the non–low income energy efficiency activities funded by the surcharge (leaving $20 million for this purpose), facilitating a one–time transfer of $155 million to the General Fund. Funding for discounts for low–income natural gas customers, low–income energy efficiency programs, and natural gas energy research was maintained at budgeted levels.\nEnergy Research and Renewable Energy Incentives. The budget includes $67 million for energy–related research and development (electricity and natural gas) that was funded through the Energy Commission's Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) Program. This expenditure amount reflects partial–year funding for this program, as the authority to collect the \"public goods charge\" (a surcharge on utility ratepayer bills) which funds the electricity portion of the program will sunset in January 2012 unless extended through legislative action.\nThe spending plan also provides about $71 million for incentives for energy producers and rebates to purchasers of renewable energy systems (like solar panels) under the Energy Commission's Renewable Energy Program. As with the PIER Program, this expenditure amount also reflects partial–year funding, as this program receives its funding support from the public goods charge that is scheduled to sunset in January 2012.\nTransportation\nThe 2011–12 spending plan provides $17.2 billion from various fund sources for transportation programs. This is an increase of $2.2 billion, or 15 percent, when compared to the revised level of spending in the prior year, as shown in Figure 24.\nFigure 24\nTransportation Program Expenditures\nVarious Fund Sources (In Millions)\n|\nProgram/Department\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\nChange From 2010–11 to 2011–12\n|\n|\nAmount\n|\nPercent\n|\n|\nDepartment of Transportation\n|\n$11,552\n|\n$11,801\n|\n$13,341\n|\n$1,540\n|\n13.0%\n|\n|\nCalifornia Highway Patrol\n|\n1,835\n|\n1,863\n|\n1,876\n|\n13\n|\n0.7\n|\n|\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles\n|\n843\n|\n908\n|\n928\n|\n20\n|\n2.2\n|\n|\nTransit Capital\n|\n64\n|\n100\n|\n500\n|\n400\n|\n400.0\n|\n|\nState Transit Assistance\n|\n400\n|\n—\n|\n330\n|\n330\n|\n—\n|\n|\nHigh–Speed Rail Authority\n|\n140\n|\n221\n|\n155\n|\n–66\n|\n–29.9\n|\n|\nCalifornia Transportation Commission\n|\n5\n|\n28\n|\n28\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$14,839\n|\n$14,921\n|\n$17,158\n|\n$2,237\n|\n15.0%\n|\nDepartment of Transportation\nThe 2011–12 budget plan includes total expenditures of $13.3 billion from various fund sources for the Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This level of expenditures is greater than in 2010–11 by about $1.5 billion (or 13 percent) mainly due to the timing of the expenditure of certain one–time funds. Specifically, Proposition 1B bond funds and federal stimulus funds were not spent at the rate assumed in the 2010–11 Budget Act, with the result that 2010–11 expenses were lower and 2011–12 spending was higher. The 2011–12 budget provides approximately $5.9 billion for transportation capital outlay, $2.2 billion for local assistance, $1.9 billion for capital outlay support, and $1.8 billion for highway maintenance and operations. The budget also provides $1.2 billion for Caltrans' mass transportation and rail programs and $184 million for transportation planning. The balance of funding goes for program development, legal services, and other purposes.\nFuel Tax Swap. In March 2010, the Legislature and Governor enacted what became known as the \"fuel tax swap\" legislation as part of the 2010–11 budget plan. The tax swap eliminated the state's sales tax on gasoline and replaced the lost revenue with an additional excise tax on gasoline, among other changes, to increase the Legislature's flexibility over the use of transportation funds. At the time, these actions were estimated to result in about $2.3 billion in benefit to the General Fund over 2010–11 and 2011–12, with an ongoing benefit of about $1 billion per year thereafter.\nNew legislative action was required for the 2011–12 budget, however, to reenact portions of the fuel tax swap package because of conflicts with two initiative measures approved by voters in November 2010, Proposition 22 and Proposition 26. Proposition 22, among other provisions, restricted the state's ability to pay for transportation debt service using fuel excise tax revenues and prohibited the borrowing of fuel excise tax revenues as well as certain other transportation funds. Proposition 26 potentially repealed certain tax and fee increase measures, including the additional excise tax on gasoline, unless they were reenacted by a two–thirds vote of the Legislature.\nThe new version of the fuel tax swap, which was reenacted by a two–thirds vote of the Legislature in March 2011, relies on vehicle weight fees, rather than fuel excise tax revenues, to benefit the General Fund, thus addressing potential conflicts with both of the propositions. For a detailed description of the 2011 fuel tax swap and the use of weight fees to benefit the General Fund, please see our January 2011 publication, The 2011–12 Budget: Achieving General Fund Relief From Transportation Funds.\nThe original and reenacted fuel tax swap, along with provisions in the 2011–12 budget package, provide a total of $2.7 billion in relief to the General Fund.\n- Debt Service. Before conflicts arose with the 2010 ballot measures, $362 million in transportation funds were used under the prior tax swap legislation to offset General Fund debt–service costs in 2010–11. The reenactment of the fuel tax swap allows the resumption of the use of transportation funds to pay these debt–service costs to achieve additional General Fund savings of $353 million in 2010–11 and $778 million in 2011–12.\n- Loans to the General Fund. Before conflicts arose with the 2010 ballot measures, $437 million in transportation funds were loaned to the General Fund under the prior tax swap legislation. The reenactment of the fuel tax swap made possible $551 million in additional loans to the General Fund during 2010–11 and $210 million in 2011–12.\nContinued Appropriations of Proposition 1B Funds. Proposition 1B, a ballot measure approved by voters in November 2006, authorized the issuance of $20 billion in general obligation bonds for state and local transportation improvements. All Proposition 1B funds are subject to appropriation by the Legislature. The 2011–12 budget appropriates a total of $3.5 billion for various programs, mainly for capital outlay and local assistance purposes.\nSpecial Transportation Programs\nSignificant Funds Available to Local Operators for Public Transportation. The 2011–12 budget package provides an estimated $330 million for the State Transit Assistance program to support transit operations. In contrast to past years, the 2011–12 budget package provides no Proposition 1B funding to local transit operators for capital projects. However, the administration estimates $500 million will be available to local operators for these purposes from unspent allocations that were made in previous years.\nHigh–Speed Rail Authority\nFederal Funds Supplement State Bond Funding. The 2011–12 budget plan appropriates $155 million to the California High–Speed Rail Authority (HSRA), including $89 million in state bond funds from Proposition 1A of 2008 and $66 million in federal funds, for the following uses:\n- Preparation for Right–of–Way Acquisition. About $71 million will be spent for contract services to prepare to purchase rights–of–way or the land upon which the train will eventually operate. This includes $38 million in state bond funds and $33 million in federal funding. In order to provide for additional legislative review of the high–speed rail project, statutory language in the 2011–12 Budget Act generally forbids the purchase of rights–of–way prior to January 1, 2012. However, HSRA may proceed with a right–of–way purchase if it provides at least 60 days before the date of purchase an explanation of the critical need to purchase the land.\n- Project–Level Planning and Design. About $9 million will be spent for contract services to perform preliminary design and environmental review for the nine segments of the rail system. This includes $5 million in state bond funds and $4 million in federal funding.\n- Contract Services and State Administrative Costs. About $52 million will be spent for contract services for overall program management, as well as roughly $14 million for various other contracts, including communications and financial consulting services. An additional $9 million is authorized for state administrative costs and support of the authority.\nThe budget plan makes one–half of the funds appropriated to HSRA available only after it has met certain reporting requirements, such as providing an analysis of the revenue that would be contributed to the project from a private operator and an update of the financial plan for the project that includes alternative funding scenarios.\nProposition 1A Funds for Some Connector Rail Projects Vetoed. The Governor vetoed $235 million in Proposition 1A bond funds that the Legislature had budgeted for intercity rail and local rail projects that would provide connectivity to the high–speed rail system. This action leaves about $28 billion in Proposition 1A funds for safety projects on various local rail and intercity rail corridors in the 2011–12 budget plan.\nCalifornia Highway Patrol and Department of Motor Vehicles\nThe 2011–12 budget provides $1.9 billion to fund California Highway Patrol operations, or roughly the same amount as was provided in 2010–11. The funding includes support for the department's ongoing programs ($1.8 billion), the cost of various capital outlay projects ($72 million), the full–year cost of the 180 patrol officers that were added in 2010–11 ($16 million), and the cost of a new computer–aided dispatch system ($7 million). For DMV, the budget provides $928 million for departmental operations, about $20 million (2 percent) more than in 2010–11, mostly due to increased costs resulting from the expiration of furloughs and the personal leave program.\nIncreased Vehicle Registration Fee and Funding Shifts. The DMV receives funding to support its operations from a variety of sources, including registration fees and VLF. State law requires DMV to charge a registration fee on vehicles and trailers registered in the state (with certain exceptions). The VLF, which is also paid to the DMV at the time of vehicle registration, is an annual fee on the ownership of a registered vehicle in California. It is levied in place of taxing vehicles as personal property. The bulk of VLF revenue is distributed to cities and counties, but the DMV retains a portion to pay for its collection costs. The 2011–12 budget plan contains changes that affect both sources of revenues for the DMV.\nFirst, the 2011–12 budget plan increases the vehicle registration fee from $31 to $43. This change is assumed to generate $300 million in additional revenues that will be used to offset DMV costs. Second, the budget shifts $300 million in VLF revenues that previously were used for the support of DMV instead to local law enforcement programs. This funding shift is one component of a realignment of public safety programs discussed in more detail earlier in this chapter.\nMotor Vehicle Account (MVA). To help address the General Fund condition, the 2011–12 budget provides a one–time transfer of $72 million from the MVA to the General Fund. Unlike other MVA revenues, these funds are not restricted by Article XIX of the State Constitution and thus are available for general state purposes. The 2010–11 Budget Act provided a loan of up to $180 million to the General Fund, which must be repaid to the MVA within three years. The 2011–12 budget plan provides a partial repayment of the loan in the amount of $19.5 million, leaving $160.5 million to be repaid over the next two years.\nOther Major Provisions\nRedevelopment Agencies\nThe budget package includes two bills related to redevelopment agencies designed to generate $1.7 billion in 2011–12 and about $400 million annually in out–years. The first bill eliminates the statutory authority for redevelopment agencies to exist. Under this bill, successor agencies are established for the purpose of paying off any existing redevelopment debt with revenues that otherwise would have gone to the redevelopment agencies. Any revenue in excess of what is required to pay off these debts is distributed to schools and other local governments (cities, counties, and special districts) pursuant to existing property tax allocation laws.\nThe second bill permits a city or county that has a redevelopment agency to prevent that agency's elimination by making a remittance payment to the K–12 schools, fire protection districts, and transit districts that overlap with the redevelopment agency's project areas. Each city or county's remittance payment is calculated as its proportionate share of $1.7 billion in 2011–12 and $400 million in out–years. This calculation takes into account each redevelopment agency's 2008–09 tax increment revenues, debt payments, and pass–through payments. On a one–time basis in 2011–12, the bill exempts redevelopment agencies from the requirement to set aside funds (usually 20 percent of their tax increment revenues) for low– and moderate–income housing projects.\nThe second bill also has provisions that adjust cities' and counties' out–year annual remittance payments primarily based on growth in tax increment revenues and new debt issued by redevelopment agencies (excluding debt issued for affordable housing programs). The bill also states the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to establish a reduced schedule of payments for new redevelopment debt related to projects designed to achieve statewide environmental, transportation, or community development goals.\nEffect on State Education Spending. These bills provide additional funds to K–12 schools—either increased property revenues (in cases where the redevelopment agency is eliminated) or remittance payments (in cases where a city or county elects to make these payments). In both cases, the additional funds offset state–required education spending for one year: 2011–12. Specifically, the additional funds are counted as local property tax revenues in 2011–12 and included in the calculation of the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. Beginning in 2012–13, however, the property tax revenues and remittance payments are excluded from the Proposition 98 calculation and do not offset state–required education spending.\nState–Mandated Local Programs (Non–Education)\nThe 2011–12 budget approved by the Legislature provides $47.8 million (General Fund) for 13 mandates. The budget bill suspended 60 non–education mandates, including a series of mandates requiring counties to provide absentee ballots. When the Legislature suspends a mandate, for one year (1) local governments are not required to implement its requirements and (2) the state may postpone its obligations to pay the accumulated mandates bills. The budget took no action regarding the Open Meeting Act mandate. Because the budget did not suspend, repeal, or fund this mandate, it is not clear whether local governments are required to implement its requirements during the budget year.\nThe budget package deferred payment for two labor relations mandates (Peace Officer Procedural Bill of Rights and Local Government Employment Relations), as well as a scheduled payment (about $100 million) towards retiring the state's accumulated non–education mandate debt. Finally, as we discuss more fully in our \"K–12 Education\" section of this report, the budget transferred responsibility to provide mental health services to special education students (the AB 3632 mandate) from counties to schools.\nEmployee Compensation\nSavings From Collective Bargaining. The state's rank–and–file employees are organized into 21 collective bargaining units. During the course of 2010–11, the Legislature ratified contracts with each of these units. While managers and supervisors are not included in the collective bargaining process, the state extended some of the provisions from the new contracts to them. In total, the budget assumes $135 million in net savings (General Fund) from these new employee compensation policies:\n- Unpaid Leave. Nearly all state employees will experience reduced wages during the first 12 months of their contract as a result of the Personal Leave Program (PLP). The PLP—typically eight hours of unpaid leave every month—does not affect employees' benefits or pension calculations.\n- Employee Contributions for Pensions. Most state employees will make larger contributions to their retirement, generally about 2 percent to 5 percent of pay more than they previously contributed. The increased employee contributions offset the state's contribution to employee retirement.\n- New Pension Formula. Future state employees will be enrolled in a new pension formula that generally reduces pension benefits to pre–1999 levels.\n- Health Care. The state's employee health care costs will increase for all bargaining units.\n- Pay Increase. The top step of state employee salary ranges will increase by 2 percent to 5 percent. The pay increases will occur in either 2012 or 2013 and generally be equal to the employees' increased pension contribution.\nHealth Benefits Program. The budget assumes that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) will achieve one–time savings of $80 million (General Fund) in its Health Benefits Program in 2011–12. In future years, the budget specifies that CalPERS will achieve an equivalent level of ongoing savings from the adoption of a core health care plan (a new health plan that provides somewhat less coverage at a lower premium cost) or other measures.\nLabor Programs\nDisability Insurance Fund Loan. California's Unemployment Insurance (UI) fund has been insolvent since 2009 due to an imbalance between revenues collected from employers and benefits paid to claimants. To continue payment of UI benefits, the state obtained a loan from the federal government, with a current outstanding balance of over $10 billion. As of January 2011, the state began to accrue interest on this federal loan and will be required to make an interest payment of approximately $320 million in September 2011. The 2011–12 budget authorizes this interest payment from the General Fund. To offset this cost, the budget plan provides a loan equal to the amount of the interest payment from the Disability Insurance Fund to the General Fund. The loan is to be repaid over the next four years at an annual cost of about $80 million.\nAdditional Federal Funds Used to Support Ongoing Implementation of an Alternate Base Period. In 2009, the Legislature authorized the Employment Development Department (EDD) to make automation and programmatic changes in order to incorporate an Alternate Base Period (ABP) into the UI program. An ABP allows some unemployed workers to qualify for UI benefits sooner than would have been the case under prior law. In May 2011, EDD made sufficient progress on ABP development to certify to the U.S. Department of Labor that it would fully implement an ABP in September 2012, allowing the state to receive $839 million in additional federal funds. The 2011–12 budget appropriates $48 million of these federal funds to cover the cost of implementing ABP through 2014–15 and the remaining $791 million to repay the state's outstanding UI loan balance.\nReduction in Federal Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Funds. A 2011 federal law reduced the federal funding provided to California in 2011–12 for WIA programs by roughly $50 million or 10 percent. In addition, the act altered the allocation of WIA job training funds within California by reducing the portion available for statewide discretionary projects, probably by $16 million to $41 million. This reduction in state discretionary funding could significantly limit or eliminate several statewide workforce development programs in 2011–12. Budget bill language requires DOF and EDD to present the Legislature with a detailed expenditure plan reflecting these federal actions prior to the expenditure of any WIA state discretionary funds.\nDepartment of Food and Agriculture\nThe 2011–12 budget plan provides $336 million to fund the Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), which is a reduction of $31 million (8 percent) compared to its 2010–11 funding level. The reduction in spending is mainly due to the elimination of $32 million in General Fund support for local fairs and expositions.\nThe 2011–12 budget plan also includes a $19 million reduction in General Fund support for various CDFA agricultural programs. For some programs, General Fund monies will be replaced with revenues from new assessments on the agriculture industry and other fees will be increased for five years. For example, the industry will be charged on a fee–for–service basis to use the department's Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory and to participate in the meat and poultry inspection program. In addition, the licensing fee for a new or previously unlicensed meat processing or poultry plant will increase from $50 to $500.\nGeneral Government Automation\nFinancial Information System for California (FI$Cal) Project. The Governor's January budget proposal included $71 million to continue the FI$Cal project to build an integrated financial system for the state. Due to cost reductions and schedule shifts, the approved budget provides $38 million for the project for 2011–12.\nState Operations\nSavings and Consolidations. The budget assumes that the state will save $250 million (General Fund) through various unallocated efficiencies and cost–reduction measures. The budget also assumes that the state will save $19 million General Fund through consolidations, eliminations, and improved operational efficiencies in 17 state boards, commissions, and departments.\nDebt Service on Bonds\nThe budget assumes $5.5 billion (General Fund) in debt–service payments on general obligation bonds and lease–revenue bonds, an increase of $66 million, or 1.2 percent, from the 2010–11 spending level. This is a modest increase compared with the growth of debt–service obligations in previous years. The slowing growth in debt service is partly due to the administration's decision not to issue bonds in spring 2011 and the budget plan's assumption of a small bond sale ($1.2 billion) in fall 2011. (In recent years, the state sold between $5 billion and $20 billion of bonds annually, usually in the spring and fall.) Additionally, the budget plan offsets some General Fund debt–service costs in transportation by using weight fees (see \"Transportation\" section for more information).\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Executive Summary\nThis report provides an overview and assessment of the state's fiscal oversight system for school districts. The primary goal of this system is to ensure that school districts can meet their fiscal obligations and continue educating students. In recent years, the system has received considerable attention as the economic downturn has presented school districts with significant fiscal challenges.\nSystem Consists of Monitoring, Support, and Intervention. The fiscal oversight system established by the state in 1991 makes County Offices of Education (COEs) responsible for the fiscal oversight of all school districts residing in their county and requires them to review a school district's financial condition at various points throughout the year. If a school district appears to be in fiscal distress, COEs, and in some instances the state, are granted various tools designed to help the district return to fiscal health.\nFiscal Distress Often Linked to Unsustainable Local Bargaining Agreements and Declining Enrollment. School districts with several consecutive years of operating deficits tend to be the ones most likely to be experiencing fiscal distress. This is particularly the case when districts run deficits during good economic times, as these districts will have a smaller cushion to deal with unanticipated cost increases or funding reductions during an economic downturn. Prolonged deficit spending often is linked with unsustainable local bargaining agreements. Given employee costs are the largest component of a district's budget, bargaining agreements that increase district costs at a faster rate than school district funding are particularly problematic. School districts with declining enrollment also are more likely to have fiscal problems, since the district's funding typically will decrease at a faster rate than its costs and require reductions even during good economic times.\nFiscal Oversight Process Begins With COE Review of Locally Adopted District Budget . . . To provide a consistent framework for assessing fiscal health, COEs use a state–established set of criteria and standards. The first point of review in the school year begins when the COE reviews the school district's adopted budget. The COE determines whether the budget allows the school district to meet its financial obligations during the fiscal year. If the COE disapproves the school district's budget, the school district must make modifications and resubmit the budget for approval. Disapproved budgets are a rare occurrence (on average only three budgets are disapproved per year), in part because school districts typically understand what is required to receive budget approval.\n. . . Continues as Districts Submit Interim Budget Reports at Subsequent Points in Fiscal Year. The COEs also must review the financial health of school districts at two points during the school year using updated revenue and expenditure estimates. These reviews are known as \"first interim\" and \"second interim\" reports. After reviewing a district's report, the COE certifies whether the school district is at risk of failing to meet its obligations for the current year or two subsequent fiscal years. A district in good fiscal condition receives a positive certification. By comparison, a district that may be unable to meet its obligations in the current or either of the two subsequent fiscal years receives a qualified certification. A district that will be unable to meet its obligations in the current or subsequent fiscal year receives a negative certification.\nAt Signs of Distress, COEs Authorized to Provide Support. When a school district is certified as qualified or negative, COEs may intervene in certain ways, including assigning a fiscal expert and requiring an update of the district's cash flow and expenditure estimates. In addition, COEs must review any new collective bargaining agreements and approve the issuance of certain debt. School districts with these certifications also are required to submit a \"third interim\" report. If the above interventions do not improve the district's fiscal condition, COEs can impose more intense interventions, including staying and rescinding actions of a school district's local governing board.\nIf District Cannot Meet Obligations, State Provides Emergency Loan and Takes Administrative Control. When a school district is unable to meet its financial obligations, the state provides it with an emergency General Fund loan. The school district then works with the state's Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank to issue bonds to repay the initial state loan. The district is responsible for paying the debt service and issuance costs of the loan as well as the salaries of various employees hired to provide administrative assistance to the district. From a governance perspective, the state Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) assumes all of the duties and powers of the local board and appoints a state administrator to act on his or her behalf. The primary goal of the state administrator is to restore the fiscal solvency of the school district as soon as possible. When the SPI and state administrator determine that the district meets certain performance standards and is likely to comply with its recovery plan, the local governing board regains control of the district and the state administrator departs. Until the loan is repaid in full, a state trustee with stay and rescind powers is assigned to oversee the district.\nSystem of Oversight and Intervention Generally Has Been Effective. Over the last two decades, the state's fiscal oversight system has reduced the number of school districts requiring state assistance and has provided oversight and support while still primarily maintaining local authority. During the more than 20 years the new system has been in effect, eight districts have received emergency state loans. By comparison, 26 districts required such loans in the 12 years prior to the new system. Furthermore, to this point, no school district has required an emergency loan as a result of the recent recession and associated budget reductions. Additionally, while the number of districts with qualified and negative budget certifications has increased in recent years, the state has not seen a corresponding increase in the number of emergency loans required. This suggests the system's structure of support and intervention is serving a critical early warning function—allowing districts to get the help they need while fiscal problems tend to be smaller and more manageable.\nRecommend Preserving System Moving Forward. Despite the system's effectiveness, state actions over the last three budget cycles temporarily have reduced the ability of COEs to identify districts on the road toward fiscal distress. Most notably, the state adopted legislation that prevented COEs from disapproving 2011–12 budgets if districts appeared unable to meet their financial obligations for the following two fiscal years. We recommend the state avoid additional actions that would diminish its ability to assess school district fiscal health, provide support for fiscally unhealthy school districts, and prevent the need for emergency loans. Although proper fiscal oversight is important at any time, it is particularly important in years during and following an economic recession, when districts are more likely to experience fiscal distress.\nIntroduction\nIn 1991, the state established a comprehensive system for monitoring the fiscal condition of school districts. Under this system, COEs review their school districts' fiscal conditions shortly after districts adopt their budgets and then at a few subsequent points in the fiscal year. School districts that show signs of fiscal distress receive assistance, with the type and amount of assistance depending on the gravity of a district's fiscal condition. In the most serious case—when a district no longer appears able to meet its financial obligations—the state provides it with an emergency loan and assumes administrative control until the district has demonstrated clearly that it is solidly on the road to fiscal recovery.\nDuring the two decades this system has been in place, school districts have faced numerous fiscal challenges. Particularly through the economic downturns, the system has proven to be generally effective at identifying districts experiencing fiscal distress and providing them targeted support. Despite the relatively longstanding success of the system in helping to maintain good school district fiscal health, the state recently has taken certain actions that have temporarily reduced the system's effectiveness. These recent actions generally have reduced the ability of COEs to identify fiscal problems looming on the horizon for districts. Especially in difficult, uncertain budget times, a system of monitoring and supporting school district fiscal health is paramount. As the state considers future actions, we recommend that it remain focused on preserving the system.\nBelow, we identify the common problems that characterize fiscally unhealthy districts. We then summarize the oversight process for evaluating school district fiscal health. Next, we describe the first– and second–level interventions designed to assist fiscally unhealthy school districts as well as describe the emergency loan process for districts that are unable to meet their financial obligations. Finally, we provide our assessment of the existing system.\nSigns of Fiscal Distress\nA number of common problems tend to be found in fiscally unhealthy districts. The Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT)—the state agency that provides fiscal advice, management assistance, and other training to school districts—identified 15 conditions that most frequently indicate district fiscal distress. These conditions are listed in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\nFifteen Key Predictors of School District Fiscal Distress\n|\nAdministrative Issues\n|\n|\n|\n- Lack of communication with educational community\n|\n- Lack of interagency cooperation\n|\n- Failure to recognize ongoing budget problems\n|\n- Disconnect between personnel data and payroll\n|\n- Limited access to timely personnel, payroll, and budget control data and reports\n|\n- Lack of routine categorical program monitoring\n|\n|\nFinancial Issues\n|\n- Unsustainable collective bargaining agreements\n|\n- Compensation increases in excess of state funding increases\n|\n- Failure to maintain healthy reserves\n|\n- Flawed multiyear projections\n|\n- Flawed average daily attendance projections\n|\n- Inaccurate revenue and expenditure estimates\n|\n- Poor cash flow analysis and reconciliation\n|\n- Categorical program increases in excess of categorical funding increases\n|\nFiscal Distress Often Linked With Multiple Years of Deficit Spending. School districts with several consecutive years of operating deficits likely have many of the indicators of fiscal distress listed in Figure 1 and tend to be most at risk for failing to meet their financial obligations in the near future. This is particularly true of school districts that run operating deficits during good economic times. These districts will have a smaller cushion to deal with unanticipated cost increases or reductions in funding during an economic downturn.\nDeficit Spending Commonly Linked With Unsustainable Local Bargaining Agreements and Declining Enrollment. Since employee salary and benefit costs typically represent about 85 percent of school district expenditures, the terms of a school district's collective bargaining agreements have a significant effect on its fiscal health. Local bargaining agreements that increase district costs at a faster rate than school district funding are particularly problematic, as the district will be more likely to run operating deficits during these times. School districts with declining enrollment also are more likely to have fiscal problems, since their revenues tend to decline at a faster rate than their costs. Because of this fiscal pressure, declining enrollment districts must be proactive in reducing costs during good fiscal times when other districts in the state are providing cost–of–living increases to employees and expanding the size of their programs. School districts that do not make sufficient reductions to address the decline in funding can experience significant fiscal distress. Of the five school districts that have received an emergency state loan since 2000, four had experienced flat or declining enrollment in the years prior to receiving state intervention.\nMore Recently, Payment Deferrals and Budget Reductions Contributing to Fiscal Distress. Over the past several years, school districts have faced increased fiscal pressure as a result of funding reductions implemented to solve the state's budget problem. Since 2007–08, the year prior to the economic downturn, state programmatic per–pupil funding for school districts has decreased by 8 percent. The state also has relied significantly on payment deferrals as a budget solution over the past several years, with school districts currently receiving $9.4 billion (roughly 20 percent of Proposition 98 funding) in late state payments (that is, receiving cash in 2012–13 for costs incurred in 2011–12). To remain in good fiscal health as a result of these additional challenges, school districts have had to make significant adjustments to their budgets, including reducing their educational programs and borrowing to meet their financial commitments.\nFiscal Oversight Process\nUnder the state's fiscal oversight process, a school district's COE is responsible for monitoring its fiscal health at specific points during the year. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the COE must review and approve the school district's locally adopted budget. The district also must submit up–to–date multiyear projections for the COE to review at two subsequent points during the year. (A third interim report also is required for school districts that show signs of fiscal distress.) In addition to these formal points of review, COEs seek to remain in constant contact with school district superintendents, administrators, and business officers. In our conversations with COE officials throughout the state, we found that virtually all have monthly meetings with school district staff to remain informed of each district's fiscal condition. We discuss the details of the formal oversight process below.\nCriteria and Standards for Review\nTo provide a consistent framework, COEs must use a consistent set of criteria and standards established by the state to assess school districts' fiscal condition. These criteria and standards are used both to review school districts' adopted budgets and their interim budget reports. The specific criteria and standards used vary depending on the specific point of review. Each review, however, focuses on the following major criteria:\n- Fund and cash balances.\n- Reserve levels.\n- Operating deficits.\n- Accuracy of attendance and enrollment estimates.\n- Accuracy of revenue limit funding estimates.\n- Salary and benefit costs.\n- Facility maintenance costs.\nEach criterion has a specific standard that is used for evaluation of a school district's financial condition. School districts, for example, are expected to have reserves of at least 1 percent to 5 percent depending on the size of the district (smaller districts having higher reserve requirements).\nBudget Adoption\nIn accordance with state law, the local governing board of a school district must adopt a budget in a public hearing by July 1 every year. The school district's budget must be reviewed by the COE by August 15. Though the main objective of the COE is to determine whether the budget allows the school district to meet its financial obligations during the coming fiscal year, the COE also examines whether the district's budget plan would enable it to satisfy its financial commitments in future years. The COE also must determine whether the district complies with the existing criteria and standards. The district is required to submit to the COE any studies, reports, evaluations, or audits that show evidence the school district is under fiscal distress or exhibits at least 3 of the 15 indicators of fiscal distress listed in Figure 1. After reviewing the budget, the COE takes one of the following actions:\n- Approves Budget. The COE approves the district's budget plan. No further action is needed.\n- Conditionally Approves Budget. The COE approves the budget plan but has concerns about the district's ability to meet its financial obligations. The COE must provide a rationale for its conditional approval and recommend revisions the district can take to improve its budget situation. The COE also can assign a fiscal advisor to help the school district make revisions to the budget plan. The district, however, is not required to take specific action to address the concerns of the COE or fiscal advisor.\n- Disapproves Budget. The COE can disapprove a district's budget if it determines the district cannot meet its financial obligations under the adopted plan. In response to a disapproved budget, the district must hold a hearing and publicly release the COE's recommended changes. The district also must make modifications and resubmit the budget to the COE for review. If the COE disapproves the budget a second time, a Budget Review Committee can be established to resolve the issue. (The committee consists of three members who are chosen by the school district from a list of candidates provided by the SPI.) The committee reviews the COE's concerns and determines whether they merit disapproval of the district's budget. If the committee rules in favor of the district, the school district can implement its budget plan without modifications. If the committee rules in favor of the COE, the district must submit modifications to the SPI for approval. If the SPI rejects the district's revised budget plan, the COE can implement a budget plan for the district.\nBudget Review Provides Feedback for All Districts. Even when the COE approves a district's budget plan, the COE review can provide useful feedback and point out key areas that merit the district's attention. For example, the COE may point out that more accurate estimates of the school district's annual enrollment would help prevent inadvertent deficit spending in future years. Such an analysis gives the district additional information on the specific issues that the COE thinks are important in ensuring the long–term fiscal health of the district.\nDisapproved Budgets Are Rare. Given the constant communication between districts and COEs, school districts typically have a clear understanding of the actions they must take to have their budget plans approved by the COE. As a result, a disapproved budget is rare. Since 1991–92, an average of three school districts have had their budgets disapproved each year (less than 1 percent of all districts). A Budget Review Committee also is a very rare occurrence. Roughly seven of eight districts with disapproved budgets resolved the issue working directly with their COE.\nInterim Reporting\nAfter reviewing a school district's adopted budget, COEs review the financial health of school districts at two points during the school year. The information required and report due dates are shown in Figure 2. By December 15, school districts must provide COEs with a financial report based on revenue and expenditure data as of October 31. By March 15, districts must provide a financial report based on data as of January 31. These reports are known as first interim and second interim. Districts must provide COEs with an interim report that includes revenue and expenditure estimates for the current year and two subsequent fiscal years. The COE reviews each district's report and uses the criteria and standards to place districts into one of the following three categories:\n- Positive Certification. Will meet obligations for current and two subsequent years.\n- Qualified Certification. May not meet financial obligations for current or either of the two subsequent fiscal years.\n- Negative Certification. Will be unable to meet financial obligations for current or subsequent fiscal year.\nHighest Number of Qualified and Negative Certifications in 2009–10 and 2010–11. Figure 3 shows the number of qualified and negative (\"at–risk\") districts each year since 1991–92. As the figure shows, the number of districts with such certifications significantly increased beginning in 2007–08. The year with the most at–risk districts was in 2009–10, the first full year following major state reductions in education funding. Given certifications are based on the district's fiscal condition in the current and two subsequent fiscal years, assumptions about future funding have a significant effect on a school district's certification. The basis for assessing second interim reports (submitted based on data as of January 31) is the Governor's January 10 budget proposal. If the Governor's budget proposes to make significant budget reductions, districts are more likely to be certified as negative or qualified if they do not have a plan for implementing the Governor's proposed reductions.\nFirst Level of Intervention for At–Risk Districts\nThe oversight process is designed to address the school district's fiscal problems with the least amount of intervention possible. When a district is certified as qualified or negative during the interim reporting process, the state's fiscal oversight system provides COEs with certain tools to assist school districts as well as creates additional reporting requirements for these districts. Existing law also allows COEs to use these tools if a school district received a positive certification but now appears unable to meet its financial obligations. These tools and additional reporting requirements are shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4\nIntervention for At–Risk Districts\n|\nFirst–Level Intervention for Qualified and Negative Districts\n|\n|\nCOEs Must Do at Least One of the Following:\n|\n|\n|\n- Conduct a study of the district's financial condition.\n|\n- Require a report of the district's financial projections.\n|\n- Require an update of cash flow and expenditure estimates.\n|\n- Require that the district submit a proposal to address its fiscal health.\n|\n- Assign FCMAT to review the district's management of the teacher workforce.\n|\n- Withhold compensation from the district superintendent or governing board members if they do not provide all requested information.\n|\n|\nReporting and Review for All At–Risk Districts:\n|\n- \"Third interim\" report due June 30.\n|\n- COE must review and comment on proposed collective bargaining agreements.\n|\n- COE must approve issuance of certain debt.\n|\n- District may be subject to audit or review by State Controller.\n|\n|\nSecond–Level Intervention for Negative Districts\n|\n|\nCOEs Must Do at Least One of the Following:\n|\n- Assign a fiscal advisor.a\n|\n- Develop and impose budget revisions in consultation with SPI and local governing board.\n|\n- Stay or rescind local governing board action.\n|\n- Assist in developing budget or financial plan.\n|\nTools to Assist School Districts\nWhen a school district is certified as qualified or negative, the COE will take action to develop further understanding of the district's financial condition and help the district develop a plan for returning to fiscal health. Under state law, the COE must take at least one of the following actions:\n- Assign a Fiscal Expert. The COE can appoint a fiscal expert, at no cost to the district, to help the district improve its fiscal health. Fiscal experts tend to be former school district superintendents or chief business officers with significant experience in school district fiscal issues. The expert, however, has no formal authority to impose his or her recommendations. The school district governing board still maintains all authority to make the necessary changes to improve the district's fiscal health. Based on our discussions with COE staff, assigning a fiscal expert is common, particularly for school districts with a negative certification.\n- Conduct a Study of Financial Condition. The COE can conduct a study of the school district's financial condition to develop a more thorough understanding of the school district's financial problems. The study must include a review of the internal controls currently in place to manage district expenditures.\n- Require Report of Financial Projections. To develop a greater understanding of the district's finances, the COE can require the district to submit financial projections of all fund and cash balances for the current and subsequent fiscal years.\n- Require Update of Cash Flow and Expenditure Estimates. The COE can require the district to revise its financial documents to ensure that information is accurate and based on the latest information. Specifically, the COE can require the district to review its accounting of existing contracts and financial transactions, update its cash flow analyses, and resubmit its monthly or quarterly budget revisions.\n- Require District Submit Proposal to Address Fiscal Health. The COE can direct the district to submit a proposal that would address the primary fiscal issues that caused the district to be certified as qualified or negative.\n- Assign FCMAT to Review Teacher Workforce Issues. The COE can assign FCMAT to study and provide recommendations to streamline and improve the district's teacher hiring process, teacher retention rate, extent of teacher misassignments, and supply of highly qualified teachers.\n- Withhold Compensation. The COE can withhold the compensation of the district superintendent or governing board members if they fail to provide all requested financial information.\nAdditional Oversight for All At–Risk Districts\nIn addition to the above corrective actions that COEs can take, qualified and negative school districts are subject to additional requirements for reporting and review. These requirements ensure that the COE is aware of any changes to a district's fiscal condition that would require further intervention or support.\nThird Interim Reporting. A school district certified as qualified or negative at second interim is required to submit a third interim report by June 1. This report must be based on information through April 30. Third interim reports provide a COE with additional information to ensure that the school district's fiscal condition has not significantly deteriorated during the subsequent months since the second interim report.\nCOE Review of New Collective Bargaining Agreements. Prior to approving any new collective bargaining agreement, qualified or negative school districts must allow the COE at least ten working days to review and comment on whether the proposed agreement would endanger the fiscal health of the district. The COE notifies the school district governing board, school district superintendent, and all parent and teacher organizations within ten days if the agreement would endanger the fiscal well–being of the district. The school district is required to provide all information to the COE necessary to assess the cost of the collective bargaining agreement and list any budget revisions that the school district must make to have sufficient funds to fulfill the agreement. If the school district does not make these revisions, it will receive a qualified or negative certification in the subsequent interim report.\nCOE Approval to Issue Certain Debt. Prior to issuing non–voter approved debt, a qualified or negative school district must obtain a determination from the COE that the district would likely be able to repay the debt. School districts issue non–voter approved debt for a number or reasons. For example, many districts issue certificates of participation to finance facility projects or issue tax and revenue anticipation notes to meet their cash flow needs. The COE determination provides an additional layer of oversight to ensure that school districts do not issue debt that is unlikely to be repaid. The COE also must issue the determination for non–voter approved debt in the year following the negative or qualified certification, even if the district has a positive certification.\nPossible Controller Audit or Review. When a district is qualified or negative, the State Controller has the authority to audit or review the fiscal condition of the district at any time during the year. The controller, however, rarely exercises this authority.\nCOEs Can Intervene in Some Districts With Positive Certification\nThe COE's assessment of a school district's financial condition can change shortly after major reporting periods, as the school district updates its revenue and expenditure estimates based on the latest data. In some cases, a school district with a positive certification may be at risk of not meeting its financial obligations due to changes in its revenue or expenditure estimates. If a COE finds that a district with positive certification would be classified as qualified or negative using more up–to–date information, existing law allows COEs to use the same tools that can be used for qualified or negative districts. This ensures the COE can assist any district whose fiscal situation has deteriorated after interim reporting was completed.\nSecond Level of Intervention for Negative Districts\nIf a district's fiscal condition has not improved after the initial level of intervention, the existing fiscal oversight system allows COEs to impose more intense interventions if a district has a negative certification (or if the district has a positive certification but is later deemed to be unable to meet its obligations in the current or subsequent fiscal year, the equivalent of a negative certification). In these cases, the COE must notify the school district governing board, the school district superintendent, the SPI, and all parent and teacher organizations in the district that the school district still appears unable to meet its financial obligations. In the notification, the COE must include its assumptions in making the determination. As Figure 4 shows, the COE then must take at least one of the following actions:\n- Assign Fiscal Advisor. The COE can assign a fiscal advisor to assist the school district. The fiscal advisor can take the actions listed below on the COE's behalf.\n- Develop and Impose Budget Revisions. The COE can develop and impose a budget revision, in consultation with the school district and SPI, to ensure the district will be able to meet its financial obligations in the current fiscal year. The school district can appeal the revision to the SPI if it finds the revision unnecessary or believes the revision is larger than necessary for the district to be able to meet its financial obligations. The revision cannot violate state or federal law and cannot conflict with the school district's existing collective bargaining agreements. Because the revision must be developed in consultation with the school district and cannot change the terms of any collective bargaining agreements, COEs rarely impose budget revisions.\n- Stay or Rescind District Actions. The COE can stay or rescind any action taken by the local governing board of the school district if the COE finds that the district would be unable to meet its financial obligations as a result of the action. For example, the COE can rescind the district governing board's approval of a new or revised collective bargaining agreement if the COE finds the district could not afford the agreement. Of the powers granted to the COE to assist districts with negative certification, stay–and–rescind authority is the strongest. Because COEs may exercise this additional authority and overturn the actions of the local governing boards, local boards presumably have greater incentive not to take any action that could result in the districts being unable to meet their financial obligations in the future.\n- Assist in Developing Budget or Financial Plan. The COE can help the school district develop a multiyear budget or financial plan to enable the district to meet its future obligations.\nThe Ultimate Intervention: Emergency Loan and State Takeover\nWhen a school district is unable to meet its financial obligations, the state will intervene to ensure the school district continues to provide educational services for its students. In these cases, a number of actions are taken to prepare the school district for an emergency loan, process the emergency loan, and transfer administrative control of the district to the state. This process can result in significant changes to the governance and finances of a school district. Figure 5 summarizes the various changes that occur with an emergency loan and state takeover.\nCash Flow Ultimately Determines a District's Need for Emergency Loan. Whereas a school district's return to fiscal health is primarily determined by taking action to avoid deficit spending in future years, lack of available cash is the most important factor that results in a district needing an emergency loan. School districts can continue to run deficits and meet their financial obligations if they have sufficient cash reserves or can borrow from external sources. As the district's fiscal condition deteriorates, however, the district's reserve levels decrease and lenders become less willing to provide cash to the school district. Eventually, if no steps are taken to improve the district's condition, the district will be unable to borrow and will need an emergency loan.\nDistricts Prepares for Emergency Loan. If the school district appears unable to make the necessary adjustments to meet its financial obligations, the district (often in coordination with the COE) must take immediate action to notify state officials and the public. The COE or FCMAT staff may attend a meeting of the school district governing board to discuss the consequences of receiving an emergency loan from the state. School district or COE staff also may contact members of the Legislature and notify them that emergency legislation may be necessary for the district to remain solvent. Because the process of securing an emergency loan typically takes several months, the district and COE must act early to ensure the district has cash available to meet its monthly obligations, such as payroll and utility costs. Prior to receiving the loan, however, the district must develop a plan for improving its financial condition and have the plan approved by the COE and submitted to the SPI, the Legislature, the Department of Finance, and State Controller.\nFinancial Effects\nEmergency Loan Must Be Provided by Legislation. For a district to secure an emergency state loan, the Legislature must adopt authorizing legislation. The legislation typically is carried by a legislator who represents the Assembly or Senate district in which the school district resides. The legislation provides a direct General Fund appropriation to the school district. This appropriation is only intended to serve as short–term financing until the school district secures another loan that will provide longer–term financing.\nDistrict Finances Loan Using Bonds. Until 2004, the state provided emergency loans to school districts with General Fund monies at relatively low interest rates. In that year, however, the state passed Chapter 263, Statutes of 2004 (AB 1554, Keene), which required districts to obtain funding by selling bonds to private investors through the state's Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (I–Bank). The legislation was intended to relieve the General Fund from the burden of financing school district emergency loans in the event that several large school districts were unable to meet their financial obligations. Under the Chapter 263 system, the I–Bank issues bonds on behalf of the district to finance the emergency loan. The process of developing and selling bonds can take several months. Once the bonds are issued, the district uses part of the proceeds to repay the state's General Fund appropriation and uses the remaining funds to pay its obligations. Funds to make debt service payments are intercepted from the school district's revenue limit funding.\nDistrict Bears Costs of Loan and Oversight. School districts are responsible for paying the interest and issuance costs of the bonds, typically over a 20–year period. (Issuance costs tend to be fixed costs that do not vary significantly with the size of a loan.) The school district also must pay for the salaries of fiscal experts, state administrators, trustees, auditors, and other employees who have been hired to provide assistance to the district. The loan amount is intended to provide the district with sufficient funds to meet all these obligations.\nChanges in Governance\nLocal Governing Board Loses All Authority. If the emergency loan received by the district is more than 200 percent of its recommended reserve levels (typically about 6 percent of total expenditures), the governing board loses its authority over the administration of the school district. The SPI assumes all of the duties and powers of the local board and appoints a state administrator to act on his or her behalf. The local board serves as an informal advisor to the state administrator and does not receive any form of compensation from the district. State law also requires that the district superintendent no longer be employed by the district.\nExisting Contracts and Obligations Remain. The primary goal of the state administrator is to restore the fiscal solvency of the school district as soon as possible. In achieving this goal, the state administrator is to develop a budget and financial plan for restoring the school district's fiscal health. The state administrator, however, is not granted any additional powers to change existing collective bargaining agreements or other contracts entered into by the school district. These agreements must be renegotiated with interested parties.\nAuthority Returns to Local Governing Board After Careful Review. While the state administrator is in control, the SPI and FCMAT are to develop standards and expectations for the district's performance in five key areas: (1) financial management, (2) pupil achievement, (3) personnel management, (4) facilities management, and (5) community relations. The district can regain power in any of these areas if it meets these standards. When the district meets the standards in all five areas and the state administrator determines that the district is likely to comply with its recovery plan, the local board regains control of the district and the administrator leaves. Until the loan is repaid in full, however, a state trustee with stay–and–rescind powers is assigned to oversee the district. In practice, the state administrator typically maintains control for several years before the local board regains its powers.\nIf Loan Is Small, State Trustee Is Appointed. If the emergency loan received by the district is less than 200 percent of its recommended reserve levels, then a state trustee is appointed to oversee the school district. Although the local governing board retains its legal authority over the district, the state trustee has the power to stay or rescind any action of the local board that would have a negative effect on the financial condition of the school district. The state trustee is removed when the district repays the emergency loan and the SPI determines that the district is likely to follow the fiscal plan approved by the COE.\nAssessment of System\nGiven the substantial fiscal challenges that school districts have faced over the last two decades, the state's fiscal oversight system has been effective in ensuring that school districts remain fiscally healthy. The system appears to have reduced the number of school districts requiring state assistance and has provided oversight and support while still allowing school districts to have final decision–making authority in most cases. Although the oversight process appears to be very effective, we have some concerns with the cost school districts must bear for an emergency state loan. Nonetheless, other permanent, lower cost options likely do not exist. For example, financing these loans through the state General Fund likely is not feasible when the state's overall budget condition or short–term cash flow situation is poor.\nExisting System Generally Has Been Effective\nFewer Districts Have Received Loans Since the Implementation of Existing System. Since the implementation of the current oversight system in 1991, fewer school districts have required emergency loans from the state to meet their financial obligations. From 1979 to 1991, 26 school districts received emergency appropriations from the state. As Figure 6 shows, eight districts have received emergency loans in the 20 years since the new system was adopted.\nFigure 6\nEmergency Loans to School Districts Since 1991\n(Dollars in Millions)\n|\nSchool District\n|\nYear of Legislation\n|\nCurrent State Involvement\n|\nTotal Loan Amount\n|\nInterest Rate on Loana\n|\nPay–Off Date of Loan\n|\n|\nKing City Joint Union Highb\n|\n2009\n|\nAdministrator\n|\n$13.0\n|\n5.44%\n|\nOctober 2028\n|\n|\nVallejo City Unified\n|\n2004\n|\nTrustee\n|\n60.0\n|\n1.50\n|\nJanuary 2024\n|\n|\nOakland Unified\n|\n2003\n|\nTrustee\n|\n100.0\n|\n1.78\n|\nJanuary 2023\n|\n|\nWest Fresno Elementary\n|\n2003\n|\nNone\n|\n1.3\n|\n1.93\n|\nDecember 2010\n|\n|\nEmery Unified\n|\n2001\n|\nNone\n|\n1.3\n|\n4.19\n|\nJune 2011\n|\n|\nCompton Unified\n|\n1993\n|\nNone\n|\n20.0\n|\n4.39\n|\nJune 2001\n|\n|\nCoachella Valley Unified\n|\n1992\n|\nNone\n|\n7.3\n|\n5.34\n|\nDecember 2001\n|\n|\nWest Contra Costa Unified\n|\n1991\n|\nNone\n|\n29.0\n|\n1.53\n|\nJanuary 2018\n|\nGiven the effectiveness of the existing oversight and intervention system, we think preserving the existing system is critical for ensuring that sufficient support exists to prevent additional districts from requiring an emergency loan.\nOur review indicates that the oversight system established in 1991 has been effective in preserving school district fiscal health and helping school districts avoid emergency loans. Most notably, during the more than 20 years the new system has been in effect, 8 districts have received emergency state loans whereas 26 districts required such loans in the 12 years prior to the new system. Additionally, under the new system, the number of districts with qualified and negative budget certifications has increased in tight budget times, but without a corresponding increase in the number of emergency loans required. This suggests the system's structure of support and intervention is serving a critical early warning function—allowing districts to get the help they need while fiscal problems tend to be smaller and more manageable.\nGiven the system has proven to be generally effective over the last two decades—during both good and bad economic times—we recommend the system be preserved. In recent years, however, certain state actions temporarily have reduced the system's effectiveness. In particular, in the last three years, the state temporarily has reduced the ability of COEs to identify districts on the road toward fiscal distress and provide these districts with additional oversight and assistance. Moving forward, we caution the state against adopting these types of actions. As districts continue to struggle in the aftermath of the recent recession, we believe preserving the existing oversight system is vital for fostering the ongoing fiscal well–being of districts.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

That’s an unbearable financial burden for most families, including families that farm. When the expense of nursing home care arises, some families find that the only way to meet that expense is by selling part of the land they had intended to pass down to their children. With proper planning, saving the family farm from the nursing home is possible.\nFor families that have farmed for generations, the land is more than just an asset that can be liquidated; it’s a legacy to be cherished and passed down. And, of course, family farms benefit their communities, creating jobs, food security, tax revenue, and preserving local traditions. In short, family farms matter. In this blog post, we will discuss how nursing home expenses threaten family farms, and how families can protect and pass on the legacy they have built.\nSaving the Farm from Nursing Home Costs: What’s at Stake\nThe great majority—about 98%—of farms in the United States are family farms, and about 95% are small or midsize family farms. When farmland must be sold off to pay for nursing home expenses, the sale is often not to other small farmers, but to developers or even large corporations. That’s a loss to the community, but the greatest loss is, of course, to the family.\nAt one time, estate taxation posed a greater threat to family farms than it does today, as farmland had to be liquidated to pay taxes on the non-exempt part of the estate upon the owner’s death. In recent years, the estate tax exemption (also called the lifetime exemption amount) has increased to more than $13 million per person, meaning that fewer family farms are subject to estate tax. Rising nursing home costs have become a greater threat.\nFederal financial help is available through state-administered Medicaid programs to pay for nursing home care. Unfortunately, that aid is only available to individuals who have first “spent down” their own countable assets to pay for their care. The need to spend down assets to qualify for Medicaid can force families to sell their farmland.\nFarmers who were hoping to pass on the farm to the next generation may think about transferring the land and farm business to family members to avoid the need to spend down those assets—but the government is one step ahead. There is a five-year “look back” period from the point of a Medicaid application. If the applicant transferred assets to anyone, including family members, for less than fair market value during that time, it could result in a delay or denial of Medicaid eligibility. (Furthermore, an outright transfer to a family member during the owner’s life can result in a loss of the step-up in basis for the asset upon their death.)\nEven if an applicant qualifies for Medicaid assistance, in many cases, Medicaid can recover from an individual’s estate after their death for Medicaid payments on that person’s behalf. This is called Medicaid estate recovery, and it, too, can pose a threat to the next generation’s ability to inherit the family farm.\nBetween the need to spend down assets to qualify for Medicaid, the Medicaid look-back period, and Medicaid estate recovery, it’s hard to protect farm assets without proper planning. Working with an experienced farm business and estate planning attorney is the best way to prevent nursing home costs from being covered by the family farm.\nOptions to Protect the Family Farm from Nursing Home Expenses\nFortunately, you can protect farm assets for your family and receive a step-up in tax basis if you take the proper measures before you need nursing home care. The Medicaid spend-down requirements and look-back period aren’t intended to prevent individuals from getting assistance or from leaving an inheritance; they are designed to prevent fraud. Accordingly, if you work within the right legal framework, you can keep your family farm in the family while complying with Medicaid requirements.\nCreating manager-managed limited liability companies (LLCs) to own and operate your family farm can help protect farm assets not only from the nursing home, but from other future creditors as well—while giving some control to the current owner. It’s important to note that an LLC itself does not keep the farm out of reach of the nursing home, but it is a critical component of your overall asset protection plan for the farm. When your farm is owned by an LLC, your personal assets are kept separate from farm assets.\nFarm planning experts oftentimes advise creating two LLCs for your farm if you are actively engaged in farming; one to act as a holding company for farm assets, and the other as an operating company for the farm business. The operating company leases assets from the holding company, but the operating company itself does not own assets other than a checkbook and farm outputs, further shielding it in the event of liability.\nHaving a type of trust known as a Medicaid Asset Protection Trust (MAPT) own the LLCs is how protection from the nursing home comes into play. A MAPT is irrevocable, which means that once you place assets into it, you cannot take them back directly; they are completely within the control of the trustee of the trust. However, removing assets from your control also means that those assets are not “countable” for purposes of Medicaid eligibility. Assets in a MAPT also cannot be reached by Medicaid estate recovery, which means that they remain in the trust for the use of your family.\nContact the Farm Planning Experts at Dayton Estate Planning Today\nThis brief explanation sounds simple enough, but properly executing this farm protection plan is complex. Errors could result in the loss of farm assets and much of what you have worked for. To create a plan for the protection of your family farm, and to make sure it is implemented correctly, work with an attorney who has extensive experience with these arrangements.

You may also find additional information in Publication 559 or some of the other forms and publications offered in our forms and publications page. Included in this area are the instructions to Forms 706 and 709. Within these instructions, you will find the tax rate schedules to the related returns. If the answers to your questions cannot be found in these resources, we strongly recommend visiting with a tax practitioner.\nAn estate tax return (Form 706) must be filed if the gross estate of the decedent (who is a U.S. citizen or resident), increased by the decedent’s adjusted taxable gifts and specific gift tax exemption, is valued at more than the filing threshold for the year of the decedent’s death, as shown in the table below.\nFiling threshold for year of death\n| Year of death | Filing threshold |\n|---|---|\n| 2011 | $5,000,000 |\n| 2012 | $5,120,000 |\n| 2013 | $5,250,000 |\n| 2014 | $5,340,000 |\n| 2015 | $5,430,000 |\n| 2016 | $5,450,000 |\n| 2017 | $5,490,000 |\n| 2018 | $11,180,000 |\n| 2019 | $11,400,000 |\n| 2020 | $11,580,000 |\n| 2021 | $11,700,000 |\n| 2022 | $12,060,000 |\n| 2023 | $12,920,000 |\n| 2024 | $13,610,000 |\n| 2025 | $13,990,000 |\nAn estate tax return also must be filed if the estate elects to transfer any deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount to a surviving spouse, regardless of the size of the gross estate or amount of adjusted taxable gifts. The election to transfer a DSUE amount to a surviving spouse is known as the portability election.\nAn estate tax return may need to be filed for a decedent who was a nonresident and not a U.S. citizen if the decedent had U.S.-situated assets. Refer to some nonresidents with U.S. assets must file estate tax returns to learn more.\n- File another Form 706 or Form 706-NA, as applicable\n- Enter “Supplemental Information” across the top of page 1 of the form\n- Include a statement of what has changed, along with the supporting information\n- Attach a copy of pages 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the original Form 706 or Form 706-NA that has already been filed\nFor the mailing address for a supplemental Form 706 or Form 706-NA, see filing estate and gift tax returns.\nIn order to elect portability of the decedent's unused exclusion amount (deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount) for the benefit of the surviving spouse, the estate's representative must file an estate tax return (Form 706) and the return must be filed timely. The due date of the estate tax return is nine months after the decedent's date of death, however, the estate's representative may request an extension of time to file the return for up to six months. An automatic six month extension of time to file the return is available to all estates, including those filing solely to elect portability, by filing Form 4768 on or before the due date of the estate tax return.\nIf the estate representative did not file an estate tax return within nine months after the decedent's date of death, or within fifteen months of the decedent's date of death (if a six month extension of time for filing the estate tax return had been obtained), the availability of an extension of time to elect portability of the Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion (DSUE) amount depends on whether the estate has a filing requirement, based on the filing threshold provided under § 6018(a).\nIf the filing threshold has been met, or in other words, if, independent of the portability election, the estate is required to file an estate tax return based on the total value of the gross estate and the amount of any adjusted taxable gifts, no extension of time to elect portability is available and Revenue Procedure 2022-32 does not apply.\nHowever, if, the sum of the value of the decedent’s gross estate and the total amount of the decedent’s adjusted taxable gifts is less than the filing threshold, Revenue Procedure 2022-32 provides a simplified method for certain taxpayers to obtain an extension of time to make a “portability” election under § 2010(c)(5)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code. The simplified method under the revenue procedure to obtain an extension of time to make the portability election requires the filing of a complete and properly prepared estate tax return on or before the fifth annual anniversary of the decedent’s date of death and requires a notation on the estate tax return that the return is “FILED PURSUANT TO REV. PROC. 2022-32 TO ELECT PORTABILITY UNDER § 2010(c)(5)(A).” No user fee is required to use the simplified method under this revenue procedure. Estates that do not qualify for this relief, and do not have a filing requirement based on the filing threshold, may request an extension of time to make the portability election under § 2010(c)(5)(A) by requesting a letter ruling under the provisions of § 301.9100-3. The requirements for requesting a letter ruling are described in Revenue Procedure 2022-1 (or any successor revenue procedure).\nIndividuals taking advantage of the increased gift tax exclusion amount in effect from 2018 to 2025 will not be adversely impacted after 2025 when the exclusion amount is scheduled to drop to pre-2018 levels.

The fair market value of these items is used, not necessarily what you paid for them or what their values were when you acquired them. The total of all of these items is your \"gross estate.\" The includible property may consist of cash and securities, real estate, insurance, trusts, annuities, business interests and other assets. Keep in mind that the Gross Estate will likely include non-probate as well as probate property.\nDepending on how your 1/2 interest is held and treated under state law, and how it was acquired, you would probably only include 1/2 of its value in your gross estate. However, many other factors influence this answer, so you would need to visit with a tax or legal professional to make that determination.\nGenerally, the gross estate does not include property owned solely by the decedent's spouse or other individuals. Lifetime gifts that are complete (no powers or other control over the gifts are retained) are not included in the gross estate (but taxable gifts are used in the computation of the estate tax). Life estates given to the decedent by others in which the decedent has no further control or power at the date of death are not included.\nMarital deduction: One of the primary deductions for married decedents is the marital deduction. All property that is included in the gross estate and passes to the surviving spouse is eligible for the marital deduction. The property must pass \"outright.\" In some cases, certain life estates also qualify for the marital deduction.\n- Charitable deduction: If the decedent leaves property to a qualifying charity, it is deductible from the gross estate.\n- Mortgages and debt.\n- Administration expenses of the estate.\n- Losses during estate administration.\nSee Form 706 PDF and instructions PDF and Publication 559. Among other items listed:\n- Copies of the death certificate\n- Copies of the decedent's will and/or relevant trusts\n- Copies of appraisals\n- Copies of relevant documents regarding litigation involving the estate\n- Documentation of any unusual items shown on the return (partially included assets, losses, near date of death transfers, others).\n- If you are attaching to the Form 706 copies of a previously filed Forms 709, write at the top of each Form 709, “THIS PREVIOUSLY FILED FORM IS AN EXHIBIT TO FORM 706.”\nFair market value is defined as: \"The fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property includible in the decedent's gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price. Nor is the fair market value of an item of property to be determined by the sale price of the item in a market other than that in which such item is most commonly sold to the public, taking into account the location of the item wherever appropriate.\" Regulation §20.2031-1.\nGenerally, the fair market value of such interests owned by the decedent are includible in the gross estate at date of death. However, for certain farms operated as a family farm, reductions to these amounts may be available.\nIn the case of a qualifying family farm, IRC 2032A allows an inflation-adjusted reduction from value of up to the following amounts in the applicable year of death:\nMaximum IRC 2032A adjustment for year of death\n| Year of death | Maximum IRC 2032A adjustment |\n|---|---|\n| 2011 | $1,020,000 |\n| 2012 | $1,040,000 |\n| 2013 | $1,070,000 |\n| 2014 | $1,090,000 |\n| 2015 | $1,100,000 |\n| 2016 | $1,110,000 |\n| 2017 | $1,120,000 |\n| 2018 | $1,140,000 |\n| 2019 | $1,160,000 |\n| 2020 | $1,180,000 |\n| 2021 | $1,190,000 |\n| 2022 | $1,230,000 |\n| 2023 | $1,310,000 |\n| 2024 | $1,390,000 |\n| 2025 | $1,420,000 |\nA similar deduction for a qualifying family-owned business (IRC 2057) was repealed beginning in 2004.\nThe estate's representative may request an extension of time to file for up to six months from the due date of the return. However, the correct amount of tax is still due by the due date and interest is accrued on any amounts still owed by the due date that are not paid at that time.\nThe Internal Revenue Service cannot make recommendations about specific individuals, but there are several factors to consider:\n- How complex is the estate? By the time most estates reach $1,000,000, there is usually some complexity involved.\n- How large is the estate?\n- In what condition are the decedent's records?\n- How many beneficiaries are there and are they cooperative?\n- Do I need an estate tax professional?\nWith these questions in mind, it is a good idea to discuss the matter with several estate tax professionals. Ask about how much experience they have had and ask for referrals. This process should be similar to locating a good physician. Locate other individuals that have had similar experiences and ask for recommendations. Finally, after the individual(s) are employed and begin to work on estate matters, make sure the lines of communication remain open so that there are no surprises during administration or if the estate tax return is examined.\nFinally, most estates engage the services of both attorneys and CPAs or enrolled agents (EA). The attorney usually handles probate matters and reviews the impact of documents on the estate tax return. The CPA or EA often handles the actual return preparation and some representation of the estate in matters with the IRS. However, some attorneys handle all of the work. CPAs and EAs may also handle most of the work but cannot take care of probate matters and other situations where a law license is required. In addition, other professionals (such as appraisers, surveyors, financial advisors and others) may need to be engaged during this time.\nYou do not have to be present during an examination unless an IRS representative needs to ask specific questions. Although you may represent yourself during an examination, most executors prefer that professional(s) they have employed handle this phase of administration. They may delegate authority for this by signing a designation on the Form 706 PDF itself, or executing Form 2848, Power of Attorney PDF.\nYou have many rights and avenues of appeal if you disagree with any proposals made by the IRS. See Publication 1 PDF and Publication 5 PDF for an explanation of these options.\nThe sale of such property is usually considered the sale of a capital asset and may be subject to capital gains (or loss) treatment. However, IRC §1014 provides that the basis of property acquired from a decedent is its fair market value at the date of death, so there is usually little or no gain to account for if the sale occurs soon after the date of death. (Remember, the rules are different for determining the basis of property received as a lifetime gift). Refer to Gift tax FAQs.\nIf you need a discharge of property from a federal estate tax lien, submit Form 4422, Application for Certificate Discharging Property Subject to Estate Tax Lien PDF, to the IRS. The form instructions include the address where to send Form 4422.\nComplete the entries for Lines 1 through 3 in Schedule B on the second page of the return. Attach a statement to the return that refers to the particular treaty applicable to the estate, and write that the estate is claiming its benefits. Show your computation of the pro-rata unified credit in the statement, and enter that figure in the Tax Computation on Line 7 on the front page of the return. Attach to the Form 706-NA a copy of the return filed with the treaty partner. If no estate or inheritance tax return has been filed with the treaty partner, explain in your statement why no foreign return was due. If there was no foreign return, attach a copy of an inventory that sets forth the decedents assets and their values at the date of death, and explains how the figure shown on Line 3 of Schedule B was computed.\nTo determine which instructions to review and estate tax return to file, you must first determine your citizenship or resident status.\n- For estate and gift tax purposes, “residency” is effectively your domicile (see Treas. Reg. §§ 20.0-1(b) and 25.2501-1(b)).\n- A person acquires a domicile in a place by living there, even for a brief period of time, with no definite present intention of moving therefrom.\n- Note that for estate and gift tax purposes, holding a “green card” is not conclusive evidence of an intent to be domiciled in the U.S.\n- If the decedent (at the date of death) was a resident of the U.S., review the instructions for Form 706 (for decedent).\n- If the decedent was neither a citizen nor resident at the date of death, review the instructions for Form 706-NA.\nThe table below is intended to be a summary of the above information. To determine whether a return is required to be filed, review the noted form’s instructions.\n| Status | Form 706, Estate tax return | Form 706-NA, Estate tax return |\n|---|---|---|\n| United States citizen or United States resident | Yes | No |\n| Non-resident United States citizen | Yes | No |\n| United States resident (non-citizen) | Yes | No |\n| Nonresident not a United States citizen (NRNC) | No | Yes |\n| Green card holder (legal resident of the United States) (not conclusive of being domiciled in the U.S.) | Yes, if domiciled in the U.S.** | Yes, if not domiciled in the U.S. |\n** Having a green card doesn’t mean you were a U.S. domiciliary (full exclusion), nor does filing a Form 706 carry that weight alone.\nAdditional information is available at:\nIn Schedule A of the return, list the estates U.S. assets, but show no values for those that are exempt from U.S. estate tax pursuant to a treaty. Attach a statement to the return that refers to the particular treaty applicable to the estate, and write that the estate is claiming its benefits. Entries for the gross estate in the U.S., the taxable estate, and the tax amounts, should be \"0\" if all of the decedents U.S. assets are exempt from U.S. estate tax pursuant to the applicable treaty. Attach to the Form 706-NA a copy of the return filed with the treaty partner. If no estate or inheritance tax return has been filed with the treaty partner, explain in your statement why no foreign return was due.\nMost information for this page came from the Internal Revenue Code: Chapter 11--Estate Tax (generally Internal Revenue Code §2001 and following, related regulations and other sources.)\nFor federal tax purposes, the terms “spouse,” “husband,” and “wife” includes individuals of the same sex who were lawfully married under the laws of a state whose laws authorize the marriage of two individuals of the same sex and who remain married. Also, the Service will recognize a marriage of individuals of the same sex that was validly created under the laws of the state of celebration even if the married couple resides in a state that does not recognize the validity of same-sex marriages.\nHowever, the terms “spouse,” “husband and wife,” “husband,” and “wife” do not include individuals (whether of the opposite sex or the same sex) who have entered into a registered domestic partnership, civil union, or other similar formal relationship recognized under state law that is not denominated as a marriage under the laws of that state, and the term “marriage” does not include such formal relationships.\nAll property that is included in the gross estate and passes to the surviving spouse is eligible for the marital deduction. The property must pass \"outright.\" In some cases, certain life estates also qualify for the marital deduction.\nFor further information, including the timeframes regarding filing claims or amended returns, see Revenue Ruling 2013-17.\nRevenue Ruling 2013-17, along with updated Frequently asked questions for same-sex couples and updated FAQs for registered domestic partners and individuals in civil unions, are available today on IRS.gov.

Making these changes could force business operators to sell property, lay off employees, or close their doors just to cover these new tax obligations.”\nRead the full text of the letter HERE.\nEliminating what’s called the step-up in basis would have a devastating effect on Montana’s multi-generation operations, which could lead to job losses, liquidation, or outright closure. Agriculture and financial groups from across the nation expressed their support for Senator Daines’ efforts in protecting Montana family-owned businesses.\nStatements of Support:\n“Passing on the family farm to the next generation is a top priority for many farmers and ranchers,” said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. “Eliminating stepped-up basis and increasing capital gains taxes will make it much more difficult, or even impossible, for parents to pass on their farm or ranch to their children. This is a critical tool for America’s farmers and ranchers, and we urge all members of Congress to oppose efforts to eliminate it.”\n“At a time when small businesses are working to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, repealing stepped-up basis would be a devastating setback for family-owned businesses,” said Courtney Titus Brooks, senior manager of federal government relations at National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). “The current proposal to eliminate stepped-up basis would cause significant job losses and would leave heavy tax burdens on future generations. Small businesses thank Senators Thune, Daines, and Crapo for advocating on behalf of family-owned businesses and urge Congress to keep this important policy in place.”\n“We appreciate the efforts of Senators Thune, Daines, and Crapo to inform President Biden on the catastrophic impacts that the repeal of stepped-up basis would have on all family-owned businesses and are grateful to see so many in Congress are fighting to preserve the common-sense tax provisions so critical for U.S. cattle producers,” said Danielle Beck, senior executive director of government affairs of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. “The Biden Administration has made clear that bolstering the American economy is a top priority and recognized agricultural supply chain resiliency as a core component of that effort. Family-owned agricultural operations are the economic drivers of rural communities across the United States; therefore, it is imperative that this Administration understand that resiliency can only be achieved and maintained when new generations – whether their family has had a long history in agriculture, or they are breaking into the industry – can build upon the contributions of today’s farmers and ranchers.”\n“Stepped-up basis has helped family-owned businesses and farms stay in the family for generations,” said the Family Business Estate Tax Coalition (FBETC) Steering Committee. “President Biden’s proposal to repeal this longstanding tax provision would saddle future generations with unsustainable tax burdens and make it that much harder to continue operating family-owned businesses and farms across the country. In addition to subjecting family-owned businesses and farms to a significant tax increase, repealing stepped-up basis also would lead to an estimated 800,000 job losses over the next decade. The FBETC appreciates Senators Thune, Daines, and Crapo for standing up for family-owned businesses and farms and we are hopeful that Congress will protect U.S. workers by preserving stepped-up basis.”\n“If step-up in basis is eliminated it will be an economic disaster for family businesses, their employees, the local communities, and the national economy,” said Pat Soldano, president and CEO of the Policy and Taxation Group. “Family businesses create 59% of the workforce, 83.3 million jobs, and 54% of the GDP, $7.7 trillion. Elimination of step up and an increase in capital gains could result in an 81% tax on the business owner when he dies.”\nAdditional groups that support the senators’ effort include the American Farm Bureau Federation, Associated General Contractors of America, National Association of Manufacturers, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, National Federation of Independent Business, Policy and Taxation Group, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n###\nContact: Katherine McKeogh, Katie Schoettler\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

Harmony was born into his father’s hippie cult, in Bolinas, a town famous for having no sign to tell road-trippers where it was located. I’ve been there. No wonder Harmony’s mother helped keep Richard Brautigan’s American dust cleaned. Anarchy in the USA. Harmony’s father is now living in Panama. For the past 20 years. In Panama. No way. Yes way. WTF. That’s two personal connections right there.)\nAbbreviations. Hashtags. Emojis.

I usually took these photographs around my home in Florida, and then painted over them with different characters. These light characters hang out with dogs, or dance on the abandoned boat dock.

(Nothing to do with the Grateful Dead.) Drawn with a Bic pen back in 1972 and ’73. Richard brought these heads with him to NYC when he moved there in 1974. There were about twenty of them. They were drawn from the heart. “They were probably the first things I did that ever had any soul.” But when Richard reached NYC he wasn’t interested in anything to do with feelings, especially his own. He wanted nothing to do with himself. He wanted to change places with someone else, even just for a day. Just to see what it would be like to be someone else.\nSomeone else’s shoes.\nHe knew the heads were the real thing, but he didn’t want the real thing. He wanted something realer. Realer than real. A very real real that was a kind of “virtuoso real.” He put the heads away and started living inside other people’s shoes. For twenty years he lived in a lot of shoes.\nNext came the Hippie Drawings.\n1998.\nHe had moved out of NYC by then and had kids, and the honesty that he saw in the drawings that they were making reminded him of his own heads from back in ’72 and ’73. But he wasn’t ready to make something with his own blood. That’s how he explained it: “with my own blood.”\nSo after digging his kids’ drawings, he got to thinking of making drawings based on what he thought a hippie would draw. The “basing” (the direction, deflection, substitution . . . whatever you want to call it) was a way he thought he could “get away with” . . . and, at the same time, “get out of the way.”\nThe Hippie Drawings that he started making in 1998 and continued to draw for the next couple of years were supposed to be shown in London in early 2000. But, for reasons he can’t explain, he canceled the show and instead just published the catalogue. “At least you had reproductions of the drawings. I was always thinking about the idea of ‘at least’ and ‘almost’ all the time.”\nSo that’s what he did. Almost. And at least.\nThe gallery he was supposed to show the Hippie Drawings with ended up publishing a book of the Hippie Drawings.\nHe put a self-portrait of himself on the cover, from 1968, when he had long hair and a beard. “Yeah, I kind of looked like a hippie, but I wasn’t a hippie. The portrait was about looking, not being.”\nNext up, de Kooning.\nIn 2004 Richard received a de Kooning catalogue from LA MOCA that Paul Schimmel put together. Richard was spending the summer out east, close to de Kooning’s studio in the Springs. Richard didn’t have a studio. So he took the catalogue and sat in a chair and ripped into it. He “hippified” it.\nSome of the de Kooning drawings in the catalogue reminded him of his own Hippie Drawings. De Kooning had style. Richard didn’t. So he used his hippie “pose” and de Kooning’s style, mashed the two together, and started drawing directly in the de Kooning catalogue.\nFilled the whole thing up. A new head. A new arm. A leg. He even drew the word “HIPPIE” on the cover. He collaged body parts onto de Kooning’s women. He turned some of de Kooning’s women into men. (The “turn” was what he called “my contribution.”) The contribution was a way of connecting to de Kooning’s women. The connection changed de Kooning’s women into a kind of hybrid. A new gender. Inclusive. All things body. Everything at the same time. Men and women. Women and women. Men and men.\nHe says he can’t remember the circumstance or why, but he sent the hippie de Kooning book back to MOCA. There was talk about buying it. But they didn’t. They passed. “Hippie de Kooning” was returned and Richard put it away.\nA bunch of years went by, and as years go by, books have a way of hanging around.\nHigh Times calls.\n“Yes?”\n“This is High Times magazine.”\nHigh Times magazine called to ask if Richard wanted to do a cover. Something about an anniversary cover. Twenty-fifth anniversary? He doesn’t remember the exact number. But they wanted to know if he could give them some Hippie Drawings for a July cover. Richard was surprised. How did High Times know about the Hippie Drawings? The hanging-around book.\nThe only thing Richard knew about High Times was that his friend Glenn O’Brien used to be the editor. “Editor at large.” Glenn coined the term. Richard had never looked at or paged through a copy of the magazine. He wasn’t even aware that it was still being published. “Yeah,” they said. “Bigger than ever. Pot is everywhere. And if it isn’t, it will be.” They wanted to use five different Hippie Drawings and put out five different covers. Richard went with it.\nA year after High Times . . . Q-Tip.\nQ-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest visits.\nQ-Tip asks Richard if he wants to illustrate the Tribe’s new album cover. The Tribe hadn’t put out an album in eighteen years. And Q-Tip wanted a Hippie Drawing for the cover. The bell rings again. How did Q-Tip know about the Hippie Drawings?\nGot to be the book. The hanging-around book. If there’s some other explanation, all Richard will say is “beat hippie punk.” Yeah, I know—it’s not even an explanation.\nA year to a year and a half later, A Tribe Called Quest’s We Got it from Here . . . Thank You 4 Your Service comes out.\nRichard can’t stop playing it. Continued rotation. “The rhymin’ noodle.”\nIn the middle of High Times and the Tribe, Richard was working on a body of work he called Super Group.\nSuper Group started off simple. One day Richard removed a 33 1/3 rpm record from its sleeve. He held the sleeve in his hand and stared at it. It was paper. It was square. It was foxed. It was yellowed at the edges, and had a hole in it. Even on its own it had inherent meaning. Without thinking Richard took a pencil and signed the sleeve: “To Richard Hell from another Richard Hell.” It was quick. No thought. No intent. Not much of anything. Just reaction. Instant memorabilia. Richard signed the sleeve, framed it, and hung it in his studio. It hung there for a year. After a year of walking back and forth in front of it, Richard went through his record collection and found nine Sonic Youth albums. He removed all the records from their sleeves and gridded and pasted the sleeves with white acrylic paint onto a canvas. He called the painting Nine Sonic Youths. This is a correct title. It’s an accurate title. An accurate description. More of that realer-than-real.\nThe different “aging” of the nine sleeves reminded him of Agnes Martin. Not exactly the same, but the look of the painting had that soft minimal off-white tone of Martin’s paintings.\nThe next one was the Kinks.\nSixteen.\nSixteen Kinks.\nRichard said he had only three Kinks records in his collection, so he had to go to a used record store to get some more. That changed things. What it changed is going to a used record store. One, he started going more. And two, he wasn’t buying records for the record but for the sleeve the record is in.\nRichard started referring to this body of work as the Sleeve Paintings. It was an okay title, but not a really good one.\nFast-forward.\nSix months after discovering he could buy all kinds of record sleeves on the Internet (as the Sleeve Paintings start to get bigger, this made using sleeves as a background a lot easier than going to a used record store and carting home a shopping bag full of records), Richard came up with the name Super Group.\nHe had started writing the names of bands directly onto the sleeves. Writing out the names of groups like Cream and Blind Faith, groups that he grew up with, reminded him of the term used to describe what these two groups were supposed to be:\nSUPER GROUP.\nThis was better than Sleeve Paintings.\nSuper Group was lucky. Another lucky title. Another good title. Another nonfiction title. It fit with what he was making. The fit was perfect. “Perfect is true. Perfect is art.”\nIn the summer of 2016 Richard made a painting of four figures that he called his own Super Group. The painting was based on his early Hippie Drawings. The four figures were a made-up band, but “making up” was something Richard was still having trouble with. “Making up is always trouble.”\nBy the next summer he was still writing the names of bands on sleeves but he also started adding small hippie-like drawings to the sleeves. The combination of sleeves, names, and drawing made it to Berlin in September 2017, where he had a show called Super Group.\nAfter returning from Berlin he stopped writing the names of bands on sleeves and then stopped using sleeves, but he kept on drawing and painting the hippie figures.\nBack in 1998 you couldn’t own your own inkjet machine.\nBut this was 2017.\nAnd every artist he knew had their own machine, and so did Richard.\nThe Jet Generation.\nRichard started to make inkjet reproductions of his 1998–99 Hippie Drawings.\nIt’s got to start somewhere. And that’s where it started. He was appropriating himself. He didn’t put it that way. But that’s the way I can put it.\nHis old became new by using new technology.\nYou can inkjet on almost any surface . . . paper, canvas, linen, cloth. You can scale what you feed into the jet, big or small. It gives you a head start. The printed image can be redrawn, drawn over, added onto, or collaged with other drawings. A new painting can be rephotographed and that new painting can be fed back into the inkjet and you can print it out and start over. Change it. That’s what jetting is good for. Change. And you can do it quickly. The jet spits out the image on canvas in the morning and by the afternoon with nothing but an oil stick you can mark a new eye, nose, and mouth, and have a whole new painting.\nHigh Times.\nCalling these new paintings High Times made sense. It was an open title. “Open-ended.” The title was a lifetime of experiences. And besides, someone had already put that title on five of his Hippie Drawings. It wasn’t like Richard thought it up.\nFun.\n“And it was fun.”\nIt was fun making these paintings. “Or at least I thought it was fun.”\nThat’s what Richard finally told me. And he told me wasn’t sure if he’d ever had fun making art.\nHe couldn’t recall if the emotion or the point of view of “having fun” had ever entered into his past experience of making art.\nAnd if it wasn’t fun, so what?\nIt was true. And if it wasn’t true, the feelings were true.\nFeels good. Something was good again.\n“And I’m not sure I’m even pretending.”\nAnd not pretending he was cool with.\n“Yeah, I was cool with that. It was time. It was time to go back, remind . . . circle back to the ‘dead’ heads and do something that I was born to do.”\n“Check it out.”\nThe High Times are him.\n—Joan Katz\nJoan Katz is a writer and has known Richard Prince since 1990 when they were in a band together called Black Bra. She lives and works in Prague.\n.\nRock Lobster: October 20, 2017\nTake my paintings… please.\nI’ve been sampled.\nThe four painting that are currently hanging at the Lobster Club, 99 East 52nd St., are not mine. Although they are based on paintings I did in 2011-13, they have nothing to do with me.\nNada. Zilch. Zero.\nI was never consulted. Never asked. And I never gave permission.\nIt’s okay.\nI’m only dying.\nYou can take my work and do anything you want with it.\nI will not object. I will not lawyer up. I will not sue.\nThe four paintings at the Lobster Club are decorations, fabrications, interpretations, “covers”.\nSort of like when a songwriter’s song gets recorded by another singer.\nJudy Collins singing Joni Mitchell’s Both Sides Now. (Mitchell has said Collin’s “version” was disappointing, commercial, embarrassing, skinny, “made me wince’, “one sided”.\nWhat’s genuine anyway?\nMaybe the four paintings at the Lobster Club are a tribute.\nLike when fake Kiss bands dress up like Kiss and play Kiss songs.\nI’m not sure why an artist would have a “Tribute Artist”, but I think there’s plenty of Led Zeppelin band’s out there trying to be Led Zeppelin. (I’ve heard there’s artists in China painting nurses. Good luck.)\n“The paramount concern is not to care.”\nT.E. Lawrence said that.\nTell me… what should I care about?\nAs I’ve said before… there’s always someone out there who’s going to try and make you more popular. More mainstream. More digestible.

Don’t re-make a Richard Prince and pretend it’s a Richard Prince. Own up to it. Give yourself credit.

Don’t\nThe Ripple Paintings. 10/26/2017\nNot your everyday semi-realistic preparatory plaster castor fresco with a splash of satiric\nhumor over a Whitney Darrow caricature.\nSidebar: Darrow is one of Richard’s “fab’s”. A longtime New Yorker cartoonist. He was also\nJackson Pollock’s roommate.\nA little of this. A little of that.\nHow hard can it be?\nThe Ripple Paintings are in the middle of two bodies of work.\nThe first body… Super Group. The third body… High Times.\nThe Ripple Paintings were made between 2015 and 2017.\nRichard Prince told me “the rips” started off (“Major Tom’d”), by collecting cartoons published\nin Playboy. Cartoons that were originally published between the years 1967 and 1970.\n“Three years that I remember, revisit, still think about. The turn on, turn up years. The years the\ncircle replaced the square. The years the groove moved the twist and the uptight and upright\nlost its vote. The years Mr. Jones didn’t know what hit him. These years opened up and let me\nout. Man, I felt like I cleaned house. All the phony baloney shot out of my ass. All my life I had\nbeen lied too. Now I was awake. I was receptive. And all I needed was something to agree\nwith. Between 1967 and 1970 I agreed to say no.”\n“I’ve been working on the railroad.”\nRichard told me it was a simple idea.\n“The cartoons that were submitted to the magazine were watercolors. That’s what was\nhanded in, delivered to the art director. It was how they were made. Gouache on illustration\nboard. Sketch, wash, and punch line. I bought the magazines on e-bay. I bought thirty-six\nissues. I flipped thru the magazine and tore my favorite “toons” out of the magazine, put the\ntorn page on the floor, and poured more watercolor on the cartoon. Water on water. My red\nwatercolor on their yellow cartoon. Fifty/fifty. My contribution? My psychotic breakdown of\nmy psychic connection. Also a contrasting color. My red water on their yellow water. I would\ncome back the next morning and my red would dry in its own way. It had personality. Travel,\nleak, pool, stains and puddles. And on the way to drying, the dry would ripple the paper. The\npour would do its thing. A secret ‘cover’. The drying stayed up all night. Land of a thousand\ndances. The spread of my watercolor really didn’t have to do with me. It was independent. The\nform had a life of its own, a mind of its own, and each morning after ‘the evaporation’… I got\na surprise.”\n“Trippy.”\nI asked Richard if he could pass The Acid Test.\n“Probably not.”\n“I’ve always been a fan of Ken Kesey. ‘It’s the truth even if it didn’t happen.’ ‘And when you\nlose your laugh you lose your footing.’\nBut I’m late to the Grateful Dead. I just started listening.”\nThen he went on a little Birdtalk about the Ripples.\n“They’re sexy.\nHit and miss.\nAnyone can find me.\nEverybody has to listen to Mom.\nBalance.org.\nUnmasking? Good luck.\nMost of the time I don’t have much fun. The rest of the time I don’t have any fun at all.\nQue Sera Sera. (I wish)”\nRichard kept telling me it was a stupid idea. I’m not even sure he said “idea”. But he did say\n“stupid”. He emphasized the word. Like it was a badge. A medal. An award. “You don’t have to\nlook up the word in the dictionary. If you do, your probably not an artist.” He riffed that like it\nwas one of his joke paintings.\nHe liked that his stupid idea lacked common sense. He repeated. Watercolor on watercolor.\n“More water. More color?” It wasn’t a question. It was a fact. And Richard likes to have facts in\nhis works. Non-fiction. Something he can point to and name. He likes his titles to be what\nthey are. The mistakes are great and he loves making them, but coming up with a name for\nthe mistakes has to be a bull’s-eye. It’s about helping. “Don’t get mad. Get glad.” Eliminate the\nposture. Eliminate the guessing. The speculation. The subjectivity. Richard doesn’t like politics\nof symposium.\nA second coat of paint.\nThe \"jet\" is nothing but hardware.\nRichard knew how he wanted to translate the new covering.\nInk jet.\nHe’s been using Ink Jet since 1985.\nHe told me back in ’85 there were only two places in the country you could “send away” for\nan ink jet print.\n“It was primitive. Four colors sprayed out on a glossy tarp. The interpretation wasn’t very\nsophisticated and the reproduction of what you wanted reproduced was usually dull, cheap,\nand not very accurate.”\nA lot has changed. Now you can have your own machine and instead of sending away to a\ncommercial lab, you can spend the afternoon typing and coding exactly what you want and\nwatch what comes out in your own space. Echo. Soul. Emotion. The three ghosts are like\nCasper. Friendly. Convenient too. Immediate. No waiting. “No saving up box tops and sending\nthem off to Battle Creek Michigan.”\n“Ancient footprints are everywhere.\nYou can almost think that you’re seein’ double.\nSomeday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody.”\nThere are all kinds of canvas and paper you can put through the printer, and the way the ink\njets out... is fast, sweet, positive. It’s like some kind of new carburetor blending air and\ninjecting fuel into a proper ratio. It bursts out a combustion of implausible liquid juice.\n“Mine has a Holley and nitrous oxide. It’s a clean machine. It’s not a miracle, but it does the\njob.”\n“I’ll take my chances.”\n“Electronic scissor.”\nRichard tells me that’s how he use to describe re-photography back in 1977.\nAnd cartoons?\nHe’s been dealing with the subject since 1985.\n“I wanted something to draw, so I re-drew cartoons.”\n“I love cartoons. Funny drawings. Serious humor. Subversive. Laugh out loud. Another way of\nsurviving. They’re part of the magazine. And I’ve always liked to open up a magazine and see\nwhat’s up. Every magazine is an Inside World.”\nPaintings R Us.\nAfter the jet, the canvas is stretched by Kevin from Philadelphia. “He’s the man with the plan.”\nThis might not mean much, but the image of what’s printed is wrapped around the edge of\nthe stretcher an eighth inch. It’s not on top, it's around. Not much around, but around. Just\nenough. Formalism? Okay. Ingredients matter. But I think Richard would describe it more like\nhomework. That little 1/8 counts. Without it, the painting is a B-plus. When I went to his studio\nto see the paintings, it’s all he would talk about. But he didn’t think it was important to anyone\nbut him. He’s resigned. He knew that the viewer, the audience... wouldn’t pay attention.\nWhat’s forward and impactful for him is function and pleasure. The combination is in the\ndetails. Discovery takes time. He went on to say, “What’s underneath, the subtext, the “wild\nhistory”… can take years. People are bouncing. That’s what people do these days. The\nelectric stampede is so jammed up you need to stream Einstein’s pipe to go to sleep. What\ncan I say? How about the caption in that cartoon?” (He points to a Ripple that’s covered in a\nfracture of purple blaze). ‘In dreams begin responsibility.’\nBig pieces of color.\nThat’s what the Ripples are. How do you make a new abstract painting? That’s the last thing I\nasked Richard.\n“I don’t know,” he said.\n“I don’t think that way. How do I make? I go to work. I go to my studio. Shut the door and\nlisten to Wilco.”\nThere’s a pause. He looks at his shoes. He lifts one foot off the floor.\n“I can only stand this way for so long. After awhile I start to wobble.”\nI’m not sure what he means. Then he’s back. Where did he go?\n“But yea, abstraction. One thing leads to another. Sometimes I get lucky. Hilma af Klint. She\nbelonged to the five. A circle of women that tried to get in touch with the high masters. Not\none master but several. Intuition. Alchemy. Séance. We’re talking 1906. Her spiritual non\n-objective paintings pre-dated Kandinsky. She ate Kandinsky’s heart out. She died after a\ntraffic accident. I take that knowing into my studio. I take everything I can get. So of course,\nabstraction. The absence of consequences. What do they say?...‘painting the unseen’. So yea.\nBut I like a good story better.”\nJoan Katz\nJoan Katz is a journalist, living in Prague, who has known Richard Prince since 1989. In 1990 Prince and Katz formed a band called Black Bra when they were both living in Rome.\nSuper Group 10/24/2017\n“When I came here today, there was something true.” Wilco\nSuper Group is the first of three bodies of work. They go together. Have something in common. Themes. Stories. What I know. What I like. What I like to know. What I want to know. Knows and looks that have to do with music and counter culture.\nThe second body is The Ripple Paintings.\nThe third is High Times.\nThe title Super Group came to me about a year ago. But the “came” really started in 1990 when I was in my own band, Black Bra.\nI was living in Rome working in a stone cold studio and I teamed up with Joan Katz, aka Annie Anne. She played drums and terrorist and I played guitar and friend. We called ourselves Black Bra and played twice in public. The music we played was based on a song I wrote in the winter of 1986. I played the song on a Casio keyboard and recorded it on cassette in my bedroom. The song was about heebie-jeebies, humiliation, and existential agony. I called the song LOUD SONG. (I tried recording the loudest song ever recorded in my bedroom, while living in Venice California, after leaving NYC because I thought I was having a mental breakdown after I was kicked out of my girlfriends apartment where I would drink ice cold vodka all night and watch porn on VHS tapes I could rent from a downstairs video rental store called The World Of Video). LOUD SONG was eighteen minutes long. It’s the only song Black Bra ever played. It was supposed to crack you open and ring your lights out. TKO. It was supposed to be ten times bigger then the Velvets Sister Ray. I think twenty people saw and heard us. One of them was Gregory Corso. Beat poet. Writer of Gasoline. Friend of Ginsberg. I remember him. Dead reckoning remember. There was speculation about his reputation, but no reliable information. He looked like his reputation. As they say, “his reputation preceded him”.\nJoan and I grouped for three months. I split back for NYC and she moved to Prague. We’ve stayed in touched and she recently interviewed me and wrote my press release for my Ripple Paintings.\nTrans-Media\nSix years ago I took a sleeve out of a vinyl album and looked at it and liked the foxing, the beige color, the yellowing, the creases, the weight of the paper, the two- sidedness of the construction and the hole. It also had inherited meaning.\nI picked up a pencil and signed it to myself from Richard Hell. I wrote, “From One Richard To Another, Richard Hell 1977”. It wasn’t real, but it was real for me.\nAnother start.\nI glued the sleeve to an album size canvas and hung it on my studio wall.\nI kept it there for another year. This was like 2008.\nInstant Karma.\nNothing much happened after that. I kept looking at the Richard Hell sleeve. And kept thinking about making more but the idea of turning record sleeves into fake memorabilia didn’t really excite me.\nIn 2011 I was checking out my collection of Sonic Youth Albums. I pulled out the records and removed the records from the sleeves. There were nine sleeves. I laid out the sleeves in a grid, three on top of three on top of three. Another square. I looked at it and called it Nine Sonic Youths. That excited me. The name, the title connected the abstraction and made it less abstract. It looked like art. It looked like an Agnes Martin with holes. It was creamy.\nWant to make art? Don’t.\nThe next one I did was 16 Kinks.\nI only had six Kink albums so I had to go out to a vinyl store and buy ten more Kinks. Going to the record store changed. It wasn’t just about buying albums. There was a new purpose to going to a record store.\nOn-purpose.\n16 Kinks was the first time I started calling them the Sleeve Paintings.\nThe next was the Beatles.\nI did 87 Beatles.\n9 Sonic Youth and 16 Kinks were simply pasted.\nThe property of the sleeves weren’t touched. The difference in their individuality wasn’t messed with. Their tones were all that mattered. I was making something basic. Really simple. The given patterns and ‘aging’ was what I was looking at.\nPreferred.\nThe Beatles were the first sleeves I painted. There were so many I used a two-part canvas and the way I stuck them to the canvas was with white and off white acrylic paint. Things got messy. Fits and starts. There were mistakes made and I had so many sleeves to choose from, I would rip some off and put other ones in their place. I had like fifteen copies of Revolver. Using paint as glue became a happy ingredient. The right ingredient. I went to town. “Sargent Pepper told the band to play.” I was ripping it up.\nRave On.\nAfter the 87 Beatles, I worked on a small canvas and started to use 45 “single” sleeves and paid attention to sleeves that had lyrics printed on them. I also discovered you could order sleeves over the internet. The mail ordering changed the making.\nI could order hundreds of sleeves. Black ones. White ones. One’s that looked like the color of a manila envelope.\nI was listening to Chuck Berry and wrote down his lyric “riding along in my automobile” on a sleeve.\nScribing lyrics.\nIt made the idea of “collecting” more important. Prominent.\nThe meaning of Soul Music according to Rapheal Saadiq.\nI did a whole painting of the Doors.\nI drew the distinctive “font” of the Doors.\nI did the same with the Def Leppard font.\nAt first I was uncomfortable with my handwriting additions.\nIt was hard to break away from the minimal look of 16 Kinks.\nThen the idea of framing my new hands on applications helped me with my indecisiveness.\nThey were works on papers. You usually frame works on paper. Once I made that connection, the glass and frame made sense. Obvious? Sure. Of course. Sometimes. Why don’t you try it.\nMost of the time you swing and miss. When you finally hit it you wonder what took you so long.\nLooking at what I listened too.\nSo that’s what happened.\nFrom Louis Prima to Tex Ritter to Johnny Cash to Howlin Wolf to Procol Harum to Ten Years After to Fairport Convention to Sam Kinison to Sam Cook to The Chamber Brothers to Boots Randolph to Laura Nero to the Germs to Jim O’Rourke to Brazilian Ecstasy to Paul Revere and the Raiders to Jonnine Standish to Larry Heard to Silent Servant to Schooly D to NWA to the Kingston Trio to Allan Sherman to T-Rex to Lydia Lunch to A Tribe Called Quest.\nAnd when The Tribe showed up in early spring, 2016, the story of the sleeves entered another dimension.\nQ-Tip came to the studio and liked a black and white sleeve painting that had nothing on it. What he pointed to was new. It was a 48-inch square template that I had started ink jetting… using the pattern of twenty-four paper sleeves as a starting point. I printed out the same pattern eight times. The printing was on a rubbery canvas that felt like the wax of a record. The plan was to use the same eight patterns to draw on, make marks, sign and stick them with names like The Smiths, The MC5 and Booker T and M.G.’s. (The “stickers” were those labels that keep the CD in their plastic container).\nI was dee-jaying the sleeves with ink jet.\nThe Ramen Noodle.\nQ-Tip asked me if I wanted to do his next album cover. The Tribe hadn’t put out an album in 18 years.\nHe pointed to the blank template and asked if I could put a “hippie drawing” on it. I was surprised. A hippie drawing. How did he know? I did the hippie drawings back in 1998. How did he know about the hippie drawings? I never asked.\nExpiration date: The Hippie Drawings never really had an expiration date.\nI went over to Q-Tip’s place in New Jersey. Five minutes across the George Washington Bridge. Went to the basement. Showed him some mock-ups. Some preliminary ideas. Some VU renderings that had one foot in the hippie drawings and another in the smoke of a new strain that would hopefully entertain and extend the feelings that the hippie drawings were supposed to relieve.\nThe summer before, High Times Magazine asked to put some hippie drawings on some kind of anniversary issue. They put out five covers. Maybe Q-Tip saw some of the issues. Again, I didn’t ask. I was on assignment. I usually turn down requests that are this specific. It’s hard to repeat a vibe. Especially one that’s twenty years old. What I didn’t know that afternoon, after I drew all the Tribes portraits, and “hipped” them with 1500 colors… what I didn’t know, (again, I didn’t know) what I didn’t know… was that when I’d go back over the George Washington, back to the drawing board, (back to the garden), I’d make my own group portrait. The portrait would consist of four figures. The four figures were my own made up band. I called the portrait SUPER GROUP.\nThe sleeve paintings had a new name.\nSupergroup is a music group whose members are already successful as solo artists or, as part of other groups or well known in other musical professions.\nWhat is a supergroup?\nThere have to be at least three members.\nThey have to have released at least one album… no all-star jams.\nThe majority of the band members have to have been in well-known bands BEFORE the supergroup formed. I didn’t make this up. You can look it up.\nA Perfect Circle.\nMr. Big.\nOysterhead.\nChickenhead.\nDown.\nThem Crooked Vultures.\nDamn Yankees.\nAsia.\nThe Firm.\nTemple of the Dog.\nBlack Country Communion.\nBlue Murder.\nBlind Faith.\nThese bands are considered part of the top twenty Super Groups of all time. I included Blind Faith because I’ve never heard of the others.\nCream started it. The first Super Group.\nI went to see Cream in Boston at the Boston Tea Party in 1967. I think it was 1967. All I remember is how loud they were.\nEric Clapton. Jack Bruce. Ginger Baker. When the album came out I starred at it. I’d never seen people who looked like Cream.\nI’m so out of tune.\nDoing the Tribe’s album cover.\nAnother direction.\nThe language shifted. The shift became shapes. The shapes became figurative. Taking up where I left off.\nThe hippie figures exaggerated. Epaulets, feathers, embroidery, tie-dye, patches, and fringe. Crack up, head start, oompf. Excuse me… spiraling. Crash, out of control, bender. Nosebleeds. Tooth decay. Smiles wide open. I tried to do what the cover of Cream did for me. I tried to make figures I had never seen before.\nAll the bands I started to paint became Super Groups.\nThe title fit. It was perfect. I got lucky. And I could point to these new paintings and call them what they were. They had an identity. They had weight. They were freer.\nThey were free wild.\nOne or the other.\nI’ll settle for spirit.\nThe song Spirit In The Sky, by Norman Greenbaum, is used on at least thirty-five movie soundtracks. Miami Blues is my favorite. Early Alec Baldwin. Early Jennifer Jason Leigh. Based on the book by Charles Willeford.\n“Sometimes you get what you need.”\nSupergroup is what I needed. And sometimes what you need is all you need.\nI’d been working with sleeves on and off for four years, they weren’t right, they weren’t finished. They didn’t have extra extra. They had a verse and bridge but they didn’t have a hook.\nSuper Group became the hook. Sum, total, whole.\nI can stack Roy Orbison, Chuck D, Bill Evans, Patsy Cline, The Pretenders, and Lee Renaldo on one sleeve.\nStandard. Staple. Classic. Popular.\nThe whole sleeve can be a hit.\n“Playing Kiss covers beautiful and stoned”.\nWilco background.\nI’ve never listened to Kiss. But I’ve used their images on paintings I made in the late ninety’s. I printed all four members faces and sent them away to a check making company and started to write Kiss checks to the electrical company. I paid my mortgage with them. I wrote out a Gene Simmons to my psychiatrist. I waited to get them back at the end of each month. Cancelled. Cancelled checks. I put them in draws. I treated them like a secret diary. The Kiss checks were cartoons. Each of the bands persona’s were supposed to be a superhero. Kiss was part of the end of arena rock. Punk made them irrelevant. At least that’s what I’m told. It’s odd now that there’s Kiss fan clubs that show up to Comic Con. Comic Con is huge. It’s like the new acid test. I don’t think there’s any Sex Pistol fan clubs at Comic Con.\nOff the beaten path.\nGod-knows-where.\nFar out.\nI’m not sure where I’m going with this. Why am I telling you this? And who are you that I’m telling?\nTell me everything.\nI made checks out of five images of Sid Vicious. I only wrote out one Sid Vicious check. It was to Cumberland Farms for five dollars and sixty-five cents. It’s dated 2004.\nWhy Cumberland Farms? Why of all the things or places would I write the one and only Sid Vicious check to Cumberland Farms?\nGood Question.\nI was thinking of making it out to Stewart’s, or even Agway… but in the end I thought “the farms” was what my friend, the impresario Malcolm Mclaren, would of approved of. Sure, the Gap probably would’ve been a more smooth fuse, but Malcolm had no way of knowing how much I loved his Duck Rock.\n“I’m worried, I’m always in love.”\nMore Wilco background.\nPersona refers to a theatrical mask. A character that’s presented in public that’s perceived by others. The word means many things. A semblance. A new guise.\nI’m with the band.\nBack in the late seventies I played in a band called Guise. But the first night we played publicly, the flyer we wheat pasted below Canal Street, Guise got crossed out and we wrote in Guy’s.\nThe we in the group was me and my friend Frank Schroeder.\nFrank is an artist and had a floor thru loft on Chambers. Big. Windows on Duane to windows on Chambers. He was locked in to sweet lease. Grandfathered. It’s where we practiced. We both played guitar. We played at Tier 3, on West Broadway near White.\nGuy’s lasted one night.\nA week later I played another one night-stand at Jenny Holzer’s loft on Broadway. Just me. Solo. I was friends with Kim Gordon and she was living in Jenny’s loft. She designed my flyer. She called my band HIM. I think I wanted to call it Hymn but Kim changed it to HIM.\nI was way to self-conscious to play more than one night. I didn’t have the drive. I didn’t have the belief. And I was truly uncomfortable, (in my own skin), to pull off any kind of meaningful relationship with the same twenty people who showed up to these no wave party’s.\nCollaboration.\n“Collab” could of have been a good name for a Super Group.\nA lot of artists were in bands back in late seventies and early ‘80’s. Forming and reforming and trying to penetrate… lift off. I think mostly, it was a distraction from working in the studio all day. A chance to release fucked up, pent up, up to nothing, physical energy.\nArt bands.\nBush Tetras. Mars. Erasers. Y-Pants. DNA. 8-Eyed Spy. Live Skull. Blurt.\nI remember a lot of posing.\nHow do you get to Carnegie Hall?\nThe most serious was Glenn Branca.\nHis band was drums and at least seven people playing guitars. Every artist I knew who played guitar, played in his band. You usually lasted four weeks. He would come to your place and teach you the part he wanted you to play. There was no room for improv. It was his music. And you played it his way. He called his compositions Symphonies. Alternative tunings. Repetition. Harmonic drones. And when we went on stage, he conducted.\nGlenn had a following. A downtown following. Even Lower Manhattan. He was a staple at the Kitchen. I remembered once we opened up for Laurie Anderson at Harrah’s.\nFrank was in the band that night. Wharton Tiers. Jules Baptiste. Jeffery Glenn. Glenn’s drummer up to then was always Stephan Wischerth.\n(Sidebar: Stephan was a plumber by day. He would come over and fix your pipes. Instead of him giving you a bill, he’d take art. In the mid-80’s he did some plumbing for me and I gave him a print of Spiritual America).\nAnyway, back to Harrah’s, the B-side.\nI had brought Jeffery Glenn into the band. Jeff wasn’t an artist. Jeff was a straight- ahead rock and roller. With no patience for anything but John B. Good.\nBranca needed someone who could play fast that night. No time to bring him up to speed. In other words, he needed someone with talent. Jeffery filled the bill. Jeffery was a former roommate. I asked him. It was a favor.\nHalf-way thru the performance, I looked over at Jeffery and we both nodded. We heard something. The same thing. We heard a new kind of rock’n roll. We both recognized what we were hearing was something searing, loud, an exceptional sonic sound that neither of us was familiar with. What we heard was a mixed tape of Suicide, Philip Glass, and The Stooges. Kick out the jams, arm and hammer, bad manners… none of that begins to describe what our ears were filling up with. But I could tell it was filling up with SOMETHING. The music that night was top of the pops. It was towering.\nBut after we stopped, and came off stage, I knew I couldn’t tell Glenn Branca.\nHe wouldn’t want to hear what we heard. He didn’t care about the excitement we felt. “The new place.” The new hole we just ripped open. It was his band. His music. And nothing that came out of all those guitars was going to change the way he wanted his music to mean to him. Branca was the maestro. He was the real deal. He was an artist. You’ve got to respect that.\nI was out after that night.\nI quit.\nI knew deep down I was just a tourist.\nI didn’t play in another band for ten years.\nI heard a couple of weeks after I left, Thurston Moore joined Branca’s band.\nI just read the first couple of reviews of Super Group.\n“The works echo through the spaces like reverb.”\n“Prince replicates lyrics and band names, like the Smiths or the Roots, and memorializes them in new constellations.”\n“The works in ‘Super Group’ are like schizophrenic totems.”\n“The new works also recall the Hippie Drawings Prince created in the early 2000s. Having come so far in his career, it seems only logical. No celebrity is safe from the hands of Richard Prince… not even himself.”\nNot even myself.\nI should say for the past five Xmas vacations I’ve been learning to play the Ukulele.\nYoo-ka-LAY-lee.\nHawaiian.\nLet me humor you.\nLet me tell you about the time I visited my Dad when he was stationed in Honolulu Hawaii.\n1966.\nI was a junior in high school.\nI stayed with my Dad for a month at the YMCA.\nHe worked for the government and was going back and for between the big island and Vietnam. What he was doing in Vietnam was “top secret”. I can only guess but I’ve speculated that he was defoliating the jungle so our soldiers could see the enemy. What did I know? He was my Dad. He said he was an electrical engineer. That’s what he always said.\nDon Ho’s Tiny Bubbles was on all the radio stations. Ho was a big cheese in Honolulu. Had his own nightclub.\nMy Dad called Ho the Dean Martin of Hawaii.\nMy Dad also told me he loved Vietnam. And Vietnamese women.\nI think he was in seventh heaven for the first time in his life.\nGood for you Dad.\nThere’s a cartoon I re-drew in 1985 that reminds me of my father. The cartoon is of a girl carrying a protest sign that says PEACE. She’s walking out her front door, passing her father on the way out. He’s sitting in a chair holding a newspaper. He’s looking at her. The caption of the cartoon says… ANY LUCK?\nDuring the last few days of my stay in Honolulu I started hanging around, going to parties with soldiers that were on R&R. Soldiers who rotated back from Nam for two weeks of rest and recreation. Most of the soldiers were two years older than me.\nThey told me I should enlist when I turned eighteen.\n“We’re having a ball. When you come over, be sure to sign up as dental assistant. That way you can smoke all the weed you want and not get your ass shot off.”\nThe last night I was there, there was a big bonfire. Right on Waikiki.\nEverybody was in bathing suits and bikinis.\nThere were five, six, maybe even ten people playing acoustic guitars.\nThey were strumming and belting out “If I had a hammer”.\nI was in the middle of a huge hootenanny.\nBy the next summer, the love of San Francisco would boil over and R&R would replace Peter Paul and Mary’s Hoot with Hendrix’s Experience.\nCrimson Flames.\nI just collected two things Dylan.\nCollecting. A wonderful curse.\nI’m a bibliophile. The smell, look, feel of books. Tattered, musty, the one’s with the unsophisticated dust-jackets.\n“So what if I love books more than people”… is one of the definitions of a bibliophile.\nThe first Dylan I just collected.\nThe original drawing that Milton Glaser did for Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits. 1966. Black India ink on paper with color Cello-Tak applications signed in typeset text in the upper right hand margin matted and framed. 9 ¼ x 12 inches.\nThe portrait is based on a 1957 self-portrait by Marcel Duchamp and the psychedelic movement at the time. Approximately six million prints made from the drawing were distributed with the enormously popular album. Any Dylan fan knows this poster. It’s the one with the rainbow hair.\nWhy do I have it? Why do I need it?\nI could say something like I’m frightened of real experience, but let’s just say BECAUSE I HAVE TO.\nSuper Sleeve.\nThe second Dylan I bought…\nEleven original acetate recordings by Bob Dylan from 1962, owned by record producer John H Hammond… who signed Dylan to Columbia Records and produced Dylan’s eponymous debut album. While there were thirteen songs on the released album, only discs for the first eleven songs seem to have survived. The first acetate, “You’re No Good”, has a spoken word introduction that did not make it onto the final album and is not in circulation. The acetates are each 10” single-song recordings, and represent the first time Dylan’s music made it onto disc.\nEach acetate has its own sleeve, the side and track number and also Dylan’s name and Columbia’s “CO” number notated in pencil are on the upper left, and J Hammond, also in pencil, is on the upper right. Much of the same information is written on each disc in grease pencil, where a label would ordinarily be. You can’t play an original acetate more than four or five times. I’m told after the fifth play the sound starts to disappear. If you play it like seven times the sound is gone.\nBringing it all back home.\nRight now I’d really like to listen to Curtis Mayfield’s Superfly.\n\"Tryin’ ta get over.\"\nMay 18, 2017\n\"New Arrangements\"\nBuzz-Hut.\nCollege Freakz.\nDogsome.\nTimezoff.\nTaboola.\nOutbrain.\nYou may also like...\nJanuary 13, 2017\n“Yippy, we’re all going to die.”\nCountry Joe and the Fish.\nLong time ago.\nI was there.\nAnd it did feel like we were going to die. Especially after the Kent State shootings. Me and friends really thought Nixon and Agnew were going to pull the plug. Overthrow. A military “coup d’état.” We were freaked. We made plans to split for the woods. We were already in Maine, so we didn’t have to split that far. We didn’t exactly know how we were going to deal with the exile, but we felt we needed to counterattack. Lock and load. Recon. All these weird opposites of “peace now” were messing with our heads. And it wasn’t movie shit. It was messing with us because the opposites were real.\nOur model was Castro when he went up into the jungles of Cuba to fight Baptista. Guerrilla warfare. We didn’t exactly know how to go about being guerrillas, but we had no choice. We were art students. What the fuck did we know about ammunition, sabotage, ambush, camouflage. All we knew was how we felt. We had had enough. We were pissed off and fed up with marches and protests and needed to survive and fight. We probably would have been rounded up and had our asses thrown in jail before we even pitched our tents… but our backs were against the wall and “live free or die” wasn’t just some phony slogan on the flag of our sister state of New Hampshire.

But she posted a lot of pictures of herself on her instagram account… the kind of pictures that I thought looked like “new portraits”… (meaning?) the kinds of pictures that seem to exist only on instagram and pictures that let me imagine what she might be like.\nI picked one where she was sitting in a chair getting her hair done. Her hair was in\ncurlers. The “image” looked good, made up, believable… it look like it was fun. And the mostimportant part… IT LOOKED LIKE WHAT I WANTED HER TO LOOK LIKE.\nYesterday, I “birded” on Twitter that her portrait that I made of her was no longer mine. I didn’t do it. That it was a fake portrait. I also sent the money she paid for the portrait, back.

They were all brand new. I had just taken them out of a box that was shipped from Iceland where they were published. John McWhinney had spent a year looking for a country to publish the book, and when we finally got the finished edition we looked at each other… smiled… and without saying a word, knew it was perfect.\nCather In The Rye by Richard Prince.\nJohn and I were huge fans of Salinger’s first novel, it’s publishing history, and it’s rarity. Re-reading the book, which came out in 1951, was like reading prose that sometimes shows up in periodicals like Esquire and Rolling Stone. We were always astounded how contemporary the writing was. The style was up to date. Salinger’s voice was conversational, straightforward, and believable. There was nothing ornamental or extraordinary about it. The slang and profanity, ahead of its time. It was kind of like reading an essay by Joan Didion. Or a review by Luc Sante. Or better yet, a long short story by Reynolds Price.\nCalifornia dreaming.\nJohn spent a year trying to find a country that would replicate Salinger’s novel. There would only be two changes to the book. The first, substituting my name for Salinger’s. The second, doubling the price. (Actually there was a third change… sort of. We removed the author’s photograph from the back cover. We had heard when the book first came out Salinger didn’t like his portrait on the book and made sure the publicity picture never appeared on the second and all subsequent editions. Hey, if he didn’t like it… we didn’t either.)\nWhen we held “our” version in our hands it felt good. It was right. ALL RIGHT. The paper. The weight. The beige “cream” color on the dust jacket was spot on. Killer. It all made sense. The look of it made us feel happy. We enjoyed it. Everything about the object was considered.\nWe decided early on to put it out under our own imprint. Instead of Little Brown, we came up with AP, which stood for American Place. (I guess that’s a fourth change). We didn’t know until after we got the book printed, that American Place was what Alfred Stieglitz called his gallery in 1926. A strange and nice surprise. Both feelings came at the same time. We couldn’t of asked for a better association. Stieglitz’s “Spiritual America” photograph of a gelded horse that I ended up titling my Brooke Shields photograph back in ‘83 made the surprise and nice feeling feel like good karma.\nBack to the garden.\nCather In The Rye, by Richard Prince was shrink-wrapped. We brought a bunch to Central Park and started selling them. I’m pretty sure its legal to sell used books on the sidewalks of New York. I’m positive. I’m not sure if my ‘Catcher’ qualified as a “used book.” It certainly was an original book. A “new” book. But it also could be described as “another” or “almost” book. I figured if anybody tried to put me on the spot I could always say, “its sculpture.”\nWe didn’t think much about whether the police would come and tell us to wrap it up, take a walk, arrest, or ask for a vendor’s license. As I recall, we didn’t get any interference or hassle from police at all. A two-man patrol walked by, looked down, looked at me, and one of the officers said, “You always help out around here with the chores?”\nThat was it.\nUnbelievable.\nStraight out of “Clothes Line Saga.”\nI swear.\nI nearly fell off the bench.\nThe corner of Fifth and 79th is populated. A steady flow of people walking by. I can’t remember the first one we sold. Or why the person bought it. Whoever it was, we didn’t know them or why or what they thought they were buying. It felt like we were hatching. We’d been sitting on an egg for a year and it finally cracked open. Howling or Howl. Out it came. What we put out had already been out. In the words of Allen Ginsburg meets Lord Buckley meets Bob Dylan meets Sam Kinison, meets Soupy Sales, meets NWA meets the Flaming Lips… “a bird in the hand is like what?… a baker’s dozen?”\nJames Frey stopped by and started hawking the book. Talking up customers like he was a bible salesman. He sold five in ten minutes. He had a rap, a pitch. It was like he was selling Listerine, toothpaste, chewing gum. People started showing up that we knew. Word spread thru text messaging, E-mail, photo sharing. Harper Levine. Frank Moore. Glenn O’Brien. Andy Spade. Adam Lindemann came by and wanted to buy the eight copies we had left.\nMy plan was to show up once a week, same day, same time, same place, until all three hundred copies were gone.\nThe price of the book was sixty-two dollars. (It’s printed on the inside flap… double the price for the exact same book at Barnes & Noble). If you asked, I would initial the book on the back. (No extra charge for my two initials). If you wanted it signed you would have to fork over seventy-five thousand dollars. If you wanted it inscribed… two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nI know… crazy. But these “premium” prices weren’t arbitrary. They were in line with what you would normally pay for a real Catcher In The Rye if the Catcher was a first edition and it was signed or inscribed. As far as anybody knows there’s never been an inscribed Catcher with a dust jacket. Ever. Not a single one has been recorded or sold. The Library of Congress doesn’t have one. The Morgan. The Rare Book Division of the New York Public Library. Never, no one, anywhere. In forty years of collecting rare books I’ve never come across a Cather that’s has the whole package. Signature, inscription, unrestored dust jacket. I’m still looking. Waiting. Hoping. Holly grail.\nThe selling of my Catcher was easy, different, fun to do. But it only happened once. I ended up not returning to the corner of Fifth and 79th. The energy wasn’t there. I was nervous. Who knows? I didn’t want to be “in person.” The first time was the best time and anything after, felt like business. There was some talk about taking over one of those plastic booth’s at Dunkin Donuts on Lex and 88th St. “America Runs On Dunkin.” Sit and have a cup of coffee and stack up a pile of ten books on the table. I thought about that for a while, came close… chose not to… didn’t follow thru. Felt it might be more of a performance than distributing a book. I did however set up in front Rodney Dangerfield’s Comedy Club on Third and 58th St. I put my blanket down in front of the shuttered club and spent about twenty minutes. Nervous. I asked Fabiola, who ran Fulton Ryder, my publishing company, to come along and take photos. It was more like a photo op. I put on a black suit. White shirt. I even wore a vest. I ended up editing Fabiola’s shoot and put one of her photos on Instagram. It’s a shot of me standing on one leg with the other propped up against the building, my gaze is in profile, looking left, downtown. I’m holding one of the Catcher’s, the rest of them “artfully” arranged on the blanket. If you look closely, there’s a caricature of Rodney Dangerfield and an 8X10 publicity pic of Chris Rock in the window of the club behind me. The photo of me on Instagram is an Instagram photo.\nI don’t think I knew at the time what Salinger’s real story was. I didn’t get him until his bio came out a couple of years later. I’d always associated Holden Caufield’s character and teenage problems, as a coming of age story. I didn’t realize Holden’s story was a war story. A story about World War II. A story about survival. I didn’t know that Salinger went ashore somewhere in Normandy on D-day and spent 245 days in combat and ended up walking into a concentration camp and seeing the bloodless shrunken bodies of countless dead Jews piled up like garbage. I didn’t know any of that. The sight. The smell. The memory. The madness. How do you know where to begin to deal with that kind of killing and murder? How do you come to terms with genocide… atrocity? Do you believe what you’re seeing? And if you do… do you even know what it is that you’re witnessing? This harvest took place in a town in Germany. A regular town. It’s the forties. Civilized. Educated. Cosmopolitan. It’s all gone. It’s all been wiped out by fanatical goose-stepping grownups. Super race. Aryans. What’s an Aryan?\nAfter Germany surrendered I learned that Salinger checked himself into a mental ward in Berlin. When he got out, he married a woman who was part of the Gestapo. Yes. It’s true. Do you do that? Do you marry your enemy? Yes. You do that. Why? Guilt. Shame. Control. A way of dealing, coping, with love and hate. You’ve been crapped on for almost a year. Your covered in shit. You try to wipe it off. Maybe it’s that simple. You marry the thing you’ve been trying to kill for eight months and then you take a hot shower. After the wash, the soap, the rinse, the dry… you write a book about children. “An ancient child of sixteen.” Someone who’s attracted to beauty and in the end “hopelessly” crucified by the attraction. The child keeps most of his pain for himself and invites the reader to share it, handle it, take it over and keep it.\nAnd then what?\nWhat do you do after your book is a “best seller” and puts you into the driver’s seat? You retreat. You get yourself a little piece of the world somewhere up in the back woods of New Hampshire and keep writing. You disappear. You keep secrets. At least that’s what I think you do. Lee Miller, one of the first artists and war correspondents to witness the mass executions of the final solution, moved to the English country side, drank more, buried her camera, prints and negatives in the attic and spent the rest of her days gardening and coming up with new recipes for healthy food.\nJohn McWhinney drowned that winter. He was in the Caribbean snorkeling, and got caught in a rip tide. He was my best friend and the person I spent the most time talking about books and book collecting and the area between the book and art world that he called “the grey” area. He would show up at least once a week at my studio with two shopping bags full of books, prints, ephemera, zines, flyers, smut, and a cross pollination of beat hippie punk cultural artifacts. I can still see him, coming down the street, waiting by my door… smiling ear to ear… knowing we would spend the next couple of hours sharing the things that we loved the best. Things that only we knew about or cared to know… things that I can only describe as medicine.\nJohn’s death kept me sidelined. It probably will keep me over on the side for a long time. It’s not the same. I still collect books but there’s no one to share the “tonic” with. There’s an emptiness in my library. John was responsible for most of what’s there. He mentored me. Taught me the never ending points of what a good copy of Chamber Music is suppose to be. We both knew that there’s no end to what you needed to know. There’s always another copy out there. A better copy. A copy no one knew existed. The copy you have to have and can’t because your not supposed to know that there was a privately printed specially bound and numbered copy with tipped in special tissue that separates the title page from the colophon… inscribed to a family member, a brother, sister or some black sheep that you didn’t know the author had or even figured into his or her life that help make the book possible in the first place.\nThe first place. That’s the place we’d hear about, then try to get to. Quest. Collecting books, John would say, “is a strange journey… there’s not many of us on the journey. There’s no map out there that tells you where or how to go. You want a complete run of Wallace Berman’s Semina… cross your fingers. You want the first issue? The one with the table of contents pasted on the back? Good luck.”\nOver the last four years I’ve inscribed only one copy of Catcher In The Rye by Richard Prince. I inscribed it to John McWhinney. I’ve heard about the copy of Ulysses that Joyce inscribed to Ezra Pound. I’ve heard it’s not in an institution, a foundation, or a public museum. I’ve heard it’s in private hands. Do I want it? Yes. Will I get it? I wish. It’s the copy that dreams. My “Catcher” inscribed to John? What can I say? I won’t say. I’ll bite my tongue. Keep my mouth closed. Not say a word. Go away. Hide. Get into bed. Stare at the ceiling. Look up at the fan. Get a little breeze and cool off. Try and go blank. Drift. Close my eyes. I won’t sleep. I won’t dream. I won’t even give it a second thought.\n4/25/2015\nO'Sexual...\n4/21/2015\nThe Figures\nRichard Prince arrived in NYC in August 1974. He stayed in Bed-Stuy Brooklyn with a friend of a friend for two weeks and then rented a small one bedroom sublet on Prince and West Broadway. He had saved 1,500 dollars from teaching pottery to high school students working at a private country day school south of Boston. He had read an article in the New York Times Magazine about Soho. He wanted to check it out and thought he’d come down and stay for three months. He had spent most of the summer of ’74 in southern Maine house sitting for a family, and when they returned he thought it might be a good time to go the place he always wanted to go to.\nOne of the first things he did after he arrived in New York was look for a drawing class. Figure drawing. He’d been going to one up in Maine for three years. He found a class on Greene St that met twice a week… maybe twenty people went… chipped in ten dollars to pay for a model, sometimes two models at the same time. The figure drawing sessions back in Maine were organized by friends. After three hours of drawing, they would open up beer and pass around their drawings and talk to each other about what they had just drawn. This didn’t happen on Greene St. No beer. No talking about what they drew. It wasn’t AA. They didn’t share. What they did was private. Everybody was in their own worlds.\n“I didn’t know anybody when I came to New York City. I was on my own and spent days where the only conversation I would have was with a bartender.”\nFigure drawing class in 1974 was out of fashion. “I’m not sure when it went out but I can tell you, in 1974, it wasn’t in.” Figure drawing was something he needed to do. He felt connected to something when he did it… and the tradition of drawing the figure put him in a place where El Greco, Goya, Cezanne, Picasso, de Kooning, Sigmar Polke, and R. Crumb had already been. There was something safe about the place. It wasn’t crazy or wild or new or different or groundbreaking or what was next. It’s where things started. And Richard wanted to be in the beginning.\nPassing the hat.\n“Whoever showed up and took off their clothes got whatever we could afford to put in the hat.”\nThis class met over on Broome and Mercer. It was a real dump. Tin ceiling. Exposed pipes. A bunch of cats would sit on the sills or pass by and rub up against you while you were trying to connect a hip to a thigh. The place belonged to some women and part of what was in the hat went toward their rent.\nDrawing the nude was fundamental, unexciting… “squaresville.” Whatever every other artist was doing outside THE SQUARE had nothing to do with Richard. There was video. There was performance. There was post studio. There was Avalanche. Richard knew about Acconci. He knew about Smithson. He knew about Nauman. He knew about Hesse. He knew about Hannah Wilke. But he also knew about Walt Kuhn and Alice Neel… Abner Dean, Gregory Gillespie, George Tooker, Whitney Darrow Jr., James Avati and William Bailey. And he knew for himself, in August ’74, there was gouache on hot press arches, a No. 4B pencil, and a naked body. “It’s what I loved to do.” And hooking into something that was so basic and old, felt genuine. It was all about continuation… and there was nothing better when it came to “continuation” than the human body.\nRichard has said that he’ll never stop thinking about human flesh. He calls this never-ending thinking “second nature.” Sure, the thinking gets interrupted by other ideas and mediums, but head to toe is simple. It’s always there. Right next to you. All around. “It grounds you and makes you think about posture.”\nHe does it alone. No assistants having to show or give instructions to. He usually makes some kind of figure study during the summer or on vacations, or makes it part of his day, like when he goes to museums and tries to find a room that’s empty, and sits and stares at the scale of the human form.\nEvery artist that he’s ever thought about has tried it. Whether they admit it or not, at some time during their life, they’ve drawn an arm, a leg, a foot, a head.\nPhilip Guston. Perfect example.\n“I’m not sure I would’ve paid much attention to him had he not given up and cartooned his way into fat one eyed faces smoking stubby cigars. When was that show? 1970? Talk about hate. The reviews were vicious. Was he mad? Lost his mind? It’s strange to think that one of the only people who came to his defense was Willem de Kooning.”\nThe figure.\nRelevant?\nWho cares?\nDinosaur?\nNot to Richard.\nLike he’s said, “Get it on bang a gong… T-Rex.”\nRichard knows the figure isn’t on everybody’s radar. Old story. Old hat. It’s all been done. Taken care of. But that’s just it. He doesn’t think it has. He likes the dead-end. “In my mind the “conventions” of the figure is what’s cool. Trying to make something different out of something that’s already been done to death makes me bend over backward, hold my breath and count to ten. I take a pulse. It’s faint. But I feel it. It’s barely there. Flat line? Almost. But I hold on. Lay it on me. Give me some skin. Give me some bones. It’s just like that The Mamas & the Papas song… ‘I’m in the mood for love.’”\nRichard Prince: The Figures\n23 April – 6 June, 2015\nLuxembourg & Dayan\n64 East 77th Street\nNew York City\n4/14/2015\nThe Fall Of Eden\nCharles Company, his wife, daughter and son land on the tiny island of St. Barts, after taking a “puddle” jumper from St. Martins. St. Barts is an eight-square-mile piece of Fei Tsui jade in the open bracelet of the Lesser Antilles. It’s Christmas and St. Barts is where the Company’s have gone every Christmas for the last sixteen years. It’s familiar. They know the routine. It’s like a second home. There are no surprises. Aside from an occasional five-minute downpour, the weather is predictably perfect. They’re meeting Charles’s brother and his brother’s family and plan to share a rented house above Gustavia, the island’s main town for the next two weeks. This Christmas will be different. The moment they touch down, Charles can see there’s something not right. From the window of the plane Charles sees people running around, shouting, screaming, holding each other, crying.\nThe two pilots leave the plane immediately. No one comes to open the door to let Charles and his family out of the plane. The VIP Charter Service that Charles pays a premium for has failed to show up, get the luggage, and collect the passports. Charles can see his brother waving from behind a glass wall, inside the small terminal, just to the left of customs. The motion of his brother’s waving isn’t joyous or welcoming. What should have been “more routine” is chaos.\nThis is the initial “set up” of Richard Michaels “thriller” The Fall Of Eden. Minutes after Charles Company lands on the tiny island of St. Barts he finds out that what he wanted to get away from for a couple of weeks, his job, his home, his city, his LIFE… has vanished…wiped away by a nuclear holocaust. Science fiction? No… just science. All he knows is “somehow,” most of the northern hemisphere “disappeared,” ripped apart by the “unimaginable.” America, Russia, China, Israel, North Korea….gone. Someone fired. Let it go. Pushed the button. A secret silo’s somewhere in a field of corn opened up and one of those crazy big ass phallic doomsday machines came blasting out, shot up across the horizon, detonated, and X’d out an entire population. Retaliation followed. More atom filled monsters. More “annihilation.” Blame? Not important. The facts? Unknown. And besides… whoever sent these giant megaton mushrooms into the sky isn’t around to explain. What is known… is that Charles Company and his family can’t return, go back, and pick up where they left off. Never. “Never” is the new reality and what matters now is survival. The have’s and have not’s will soon be separated into “tribes” and these tribes will face a different kind of war. It will be simple. A bottle of water will be more valuable than a Rolex. And whoever has the will, the instinct, the skills, might last another day. Ruthless? Yea. That human dimension will help keep you going too.\n“Lord of the Flies” meets “On The Beach” meets “Fail Safe” meets “The Road.” That’s how I pitched The Fall Of Eden after I optioned the book and tried to convince Bret Ratner to roll out another one of his “fourth of July” blockbusters. Maybe Jeremy Renner could play Charles Company. I tell Ratner that no amount of heroism will deflect an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile. I combine the words “ordinary” and “unbelievable” in the same sentence to try to sell the story. I tell him that when Charles first touches down in St. Bart’s he’s a middle aged, slightly chubby, (out of shape) architect. I tell him after he meets up with his brother they go straight to the Eden Rock Hotel, claim it, take it over, promise the staff, if they work with them, they can defend themselves against what surly will be, “another wave of evil cracked opened by madmen that are determined to undo civilization.” “We can use Eden Rock’s natural moat like shape as fortification.” (At this point Charles’s only option is to try to rally his “recruits” with a preacher’s resolve).\n“With us or against us is what it boils down to.” I’m not sure if these are my words or Charles’s words. (I know… things are getting crisscrossed). I was channeling my pitch according to what I had seen in the movie The Player. Five minutes is all I had. I’m staring straight at Ratner, trying to get him to stare back.\n“Skip to a year later”, I continued.\n“CUT…”\n“You see Charles Company… Tarzan buff. His daughter Chloe, (Dakota Fanning?)… wearing nothing but body painted camouflage, holding onto something that looks like a medieval sling shot. Fourteen year old Davis, the son… covered in mud, caveman, (cave boy)…slathering grease on a palm size ball of tightly wound twigs. (Flamethrower). And finally Dana, Charles’s wife. The ‘Mother Lode’. She arrived on the island as a sculptor and part time yoga instructor. Skills that don’t exactly translate when a next door neighbor is trying to split your skull open with an ax. I blurt out to Ratner about the new “loaded” Dana. “She’s the reincarnation of Barbarella.” Ratner looks skeptical. I come up with, “think Raquel Welch in One Million BC.” “You know that bikini loin cloth?” Still not convinced. Then I hit it. “You remember the Slits?\nI’ve got a minute left.\nAfter “the cut,” the shot pans to Charles’s whole family, in a group. A portrait. The shot is framed as if the family is posing for one of those wishful Disney Xmas cards.\n“But its okay” I tell him. The memory will never be posted. Never delivered. Not even pony express. “The postman’s motto will be radioactive. The swift completion of their appointed rounds will be shut down by a nuclear winter. Return to sender.” (Michaels words not mine).\nA year after fighting “tooth and nails”, the dystopian ideas of JG Ballard and Philip Dick become everyday events. (And this is where the “hook” of my pitch turns movie friendly). Over a Trent Razor soundtrack, Charles’s brother walks into the shot and plants a crucifix into a hill of garbage. The hill is replant. Literally. It stinks. Flotsam. Jetsam. Beachcomb. Dumpster. Nothing goes to waste. Fifty-feet high. Jerry rigged. A steaming hill of rot that rings the outer edge of the hotel is a living maggot. The camera zooms in on the crucifix. Razor samples the opening chords of the Doors “The End” and syncs the track up with the zoom. The bubbling mass of the barrier is gurgling, burping… tripping out like an old slide show at the Dom. Charles’s brother has painted on the cross of the crucifix two words… “Charlie Company.”\nI wish I could say The Fall of Eden is a beach book. A page-turner. One of those stories you ingest, speed thru, (in a couple of days, can’t wait finish)… that wines up being a king size pleasure. I wish I could say that Richard Michaels wrote some thing close to Cormac McCarthy’s, “The Road.” (Okay that’s a bit unfair. McCarthy’s, “The Road” is a single sitting masterpiece of social science fiction). But Michaels wrote a stinker. It’s bad. Not even Stephan King bad. (At least King can get you started).\nI’m not a critic. I’m supposed to be some hot-shot artist. What do I know about handing out literary stars? I wanted to have as much disbelief and trauma that Charles Company was supposed to have when he got word of “buried worlds”. But I kept seeing John Travolta in Battlefield Earth. I even looked up Richard Michaels… half expecting him to be a pseudonym of L. Ron Hubbard, the scientologist).\nI’ve read my fair share of fantastical futuristic speculative fiction. I like Ray Bradbury. I like Arthur C. Clarke. I like Ira Levine. H G Wells. Walter Tevis. George Orwell. I “grok” with Robert Heinlein’s ‘Space Cadet’. I even a have a killer copy of Kurt Vonnegut’s first book The Sirens of Titan, where “thinking is unforgivable” and “perfection means death”. (My copy is a mint, crisp, unopened paperback inscribed to “yours truly”, Kurt, Oct 6, 2003). I get the genre. I’m not a stranger when it comes to strange lands. But I’m not even sure I could blurb Michaels book. If I had to have added a testimonial it probably would of said something like… “If you liked Lost you’ll love The Fall of Eden.” I kept thinking of one nice thing I could say about the book. Is “stocking stuffer” nice?\nWhy didn’t Michaels use the arsenals in the fancy yachts as a source for weapons? (Do some research dude). Why didn’t he chapter in how maybe the small police force could of at least freaked and STARTED the murder. Richard’s version was more Car 54 Where Are You. A joke. How the cops ran for hills the day after receiving Morse Code, an SOS that no one had the brain power to interpret. Laying low above Gouverneur Beach, sneaking back to the one room hospital stealing band aides, aspirin and drugs. Come on. Really? You want to see a “crew-cut in uniform” shuffling around attached to an IV drip full of dope? What’s that AC/DC song? Back In Black? Everybody is stuck on this island FOR GOOD. I want a plane crash. I want a bonfire. I want Tangerine Dream. I want Michael Mann. I want Heat.\nHow long before the mini marts are emptied? Why aren’t the liquors stores the first stores to be looted and torched? Drunk. Hung-over. Redrum. If you can’t make it new, what about real? THINK! The one hardware store on the island… There should of been a pile of dead bodies blocking the door, trampled, run over… stacked up from trying to get inside to get to the last saw.\nWhy didn’t Michaels have the “locals” attack those cruise ships anchored out beyond the harbor for food supplies. They’re like floating neighborhoods. I mean, by the third day of the “the apocalypse”… someone should of figured out those floating towns are filled with terrified tourists still wearing Bermuda shorts waiting… waiting for what? Help? More like waiting to be thrown overboard or captured and chained and dragged back to a locked room to be hammered over the head, roasted and eaten.\nSave me.\nThe cannibal part was never in my original pitch. I saw what happened to the film version of “The Road.” The interpretation? Spot on. The production design and sets? Brilliant. GRIM would be a one word review. REAL GRIM would be two. Unfortunately the movie put the audience in the shot gun seat and word got around. Uncomfortable. Unsettling. Unwatchable. You couldn’t help but think what if it was you that had to eat crow. It messed you up. I went to a matinee. Just me and two other customers. After the credits, you didn’t exactly emerge from that general lowering of wakefulness in the brightest of moods. By the third day the film was pulled from theaters. Dead on arrival. Poor Harvey. Viggo Mortenson and Robert Duvall and Guy Pierce should be proud though. The Road will be remembered. Sometimes Hollywood fools you.\nWhere was I?\nHere’s a thought…\nWhy not have a reggae band that was booked to entertain on one of those huge Carnival cruise ships, slip away, take over the Hotel Guanahani. There’s like what? Six in the band? Some wives. A manager. A couple of roadies. It’s a crew. There’s already group trust. The Guanahani is on the north shore of the island. It’s separated. A perfect place to “reinforce.” ‘Radio Dread’ could be on the mike when they muscle out anyone who thought they had “reservations.” Rastaville.\nHow about twenty lesbians from one of those “theme” cruises take over the Manapany. Natalie Barney (Jessica Biel) and her whole Sappho salon. Get those girls from The Decent. Shauna MacDonald, Natalie Mendoza Saskia Mulder, Nora-Jane Noone. Cue Russ Myer. Amazonian Kill Kill.\nSee what I’m getting at? It’s like the whale in Moby Dick. It isn’t a REAL whale. By the end of the week each of the six major hotels on the island is defended by a different gender, nationality, social stratosphere. Men and women. Men and men. Women and women. (Did someone say “video game rights”?)\nThe Carl Gustav could “clubhouse” the creeps. The scary. The cutthroats. The “throwaway’s.” “Road Warrior” meets “Waterworld.” Someone like Vin Diesel could be Clown Posse. A Neanderthal . How about Quinton ‘Rampage’ Jackson as his sidekick? Craig Conway could have his own harem. The costume department could make Conway a leather vest and embroider “Last Call” on the back. Kathryn Bigelow’s “Point Break” Nazi surfers marries John Carpenter’s Snake Plisskin. Racist. Demented. Death Metal. Splice up some found footage of Darby Crash fronting Bad Brains. Don’t count your chickens. Or maybe you should. Who knows? Knowing the difference between a rooster and a chicken might save your life.\nVicious doesn’t begin to describe the “Last Call.” The tribe is savage, evil. Alpha males. I’m getting Ratner’s attention.\nI tell him Jake Paltrow.\n“Did you see his last film “Young Ones”?\nThat’s the guy you want to get this treatment to.\nRatner is listening.\nThe Ill de France Hotel is grandfathered. Castle Keep for the rich. “The architects of avarice.” They were already there to begin with. Checked in a week before the melt down. And don’t underestimate the rich. They didn’t get wealthy by being stupid. By day five they’ve already had elections. They’ve commandeered a number of private yachts. “Our armada”. Rookie pirates. They have plans. They’ve got flags. What they lack in imagination they make up with entitlement. Assassins in polo shirts. They surround themselves with options. Escape hatch? They don’t have one yet. But neither does Richard Michaels.\nThe first to check out are the twenty-four year olds. They take over houses near the soccer stadium and continue to party. That’s what they came down for anyway. No family. No affiliations. No responsibility. They know they have no future and their unwillingness to even squirrel away one nut makes them “easy pickins.” They don’t even keep a look out. Most of their throats are cut by the second week.\n(An annotation I added on page 96. Jerry and Tina… fraternal twins, part of a fraternity of stoners, escape a Manson like raid and team up with “Last Call”. They’re sibling blood bond will develop into something hard to break apart and later in the story will have the only workable car on the island. The car will have a star role. Like the cars in the movies, “Bullitt”, “Vanishing Point”, “Two Lane Blacktop.” I’ve made more notes about the car but for now just go to my Instagram @Richardprince1234. There’s a gram of it. It’s green. See for yourself.\nAm I writing or reviewing? Who cares. My position? I own the rights to the book. I’m not holding my breath for something like Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove. If Hollywood ever does green light this soup, they’ll probably get some hack to re-write it and steam clean the jungle with snow. Turn the equator up side down. (Special effects is Hollywood’s idea of creation).\nQuestion Painting: When’s the last time you’ve seen a man fall to earth without makeup?\nAnswer: Nicolas Roeg’s David Bowie.\nLittle known fact.\nI was the one who read John O’Brien’s “Leaving Las Vegas.” The book was being sold in one bookstore in LA. at the time it was published. The bookstore was The Vagabond. In West Hollywood. The owner, Craig Graham, stocked mostly second hand books but occasionally, near his register, he would “feature” a book from a small imprint that he liked and recommend to loyal customers. I collect first editions. I have a habit. Craig knew my habit, knew my tastes. He said, “Richard, you like Harry Crews, read this.” I didn’t see a movie in the book but I told my buddy, my pal, my dear friend Stuart Regan he should check it out and maybe see how much a year’s option would cost. He bought the rights to ‘Vegas’ for five grand and passed it along to Mike Figgis. Art imitates life. Like the character Nicholas Cage plays in the movie, John O’Brien committed suicide just before the movie’s release.\nThe thing about the opening chapter of The Fall Of Eden… is that I’ve had the exact same thoughts when I travel to St. Bart’s. The touch down. Every time I land on that tiny white-knuckle runway, I expect a sudden shift in reality. My in-grown fear of despair and dread take over, and my childhood memories of cold war, (duck and cover), Conlerad, (“this is a test… this only a test), fallout shelters, radiation, propaganda… the endless newsreels of hydrogen bombs lifting battleships out of the water like toothpicks… anxiety, sadness, stress, insomnia take over. I know, Henry Fuseli’s The Nightmare. It’s crazy. I even think about specific episodes of the Twilight Zone. Other dimensions. Time warps. Of course it’s make believe. It’s fiction. But is it? America dropped the bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. My birthday is on August 6th. That’s either Freewheelin’ or Land of a Thousands Dances.\nWhat I’ve been told…\nNightmares usually begin before the age of 10 and are considered a normal part of childhood due in part to an unexplained coincidence. Or maybe they begin after seeing that famous anti-war ad… the “daisy girl”… plucking petals on an idyllic August day in New York City’s Highbridge Park for thirty seconds. (Look it up).\nWhen you’re in the ninth grade and there’s a Cuban missile crisis… the horror story is news, not a story. That Kennedy Khrushchev stare down really put the zap on me.\nDo I drink the cool aid or do I learn to rub two sticks together and brush up on the art of somersaulting a knife into the back of a human being. (Sample James Coburn in the Magnificent Seven).\nI’ve had long sessions with my shrink about the end of the world and where will I be and what will I do when it happens. How will I handle a catastrophe that leaves me and my family on a lawless island. Lock and load. I don’t know. Maybe this is the best way. Maybe secure the rights to some obscure nonsense paperback that no one read… one of thousand dopey stories where the end is always “nigh”… and hire someone like Neil Marshall or Joe Carnahan or Neill Blomkamp and see if I can secretly turn the pulp into some serious popcorn.\nOne more thing… the title.\nIt has to change.\nEden Rock.\nThat’s box office.\nDog Eared.\nSome circled, underlined, or checked words that I marked up in the Fall of Eden.\n‘Rescue’. ‘Honeymooners’. ‘Retired folks’. Hysteria’. ‘Philip Wylie’. Recon’.\nOther marginalia…\n“Hope isn’t in society. It’s in individuals.”\nI think I “starred” this sentence and turned down the corner of the page. The Fall of Eden had some of this applause but not enough. Richards didn’t really punish anyone. In the end, committing genocide is about stupidity, bigotry and greed. Someone has to pay the piper. The Fall of Eden is a ‘tired formula’. Pose a problem and then find a technical development to solve the problem. The characters in Eden are stock stereotypes. The love story mawkish. There’s no simple man or woman reaching the agonizing decision to kill their only child in its crib and commit suicide after, as the rest of the world evaporates around them. I know this is a nag but most Americans fear communism more than the bomb. This is what Richards fails to realize. I keep thinking about Uranium 235. I think about Wilco’s ‘Solid Tape Technology’. I think about Power Possession, caves, savages and body parts used to decorate mantles. I think about Aldous Huxley’s Ape and Essence. Judith Merril’s story “Only A Mother”. I think about the movie The Day The Earth Stood Still based on a Harry Bates story Farewell to the Master and how the movie tried to turn the story into social ethics.\nMostly I think about March 1, 1954 the Bravo H-bomb test near the Marshall Islands and how the test fatally contaminated sailors aboard a Japanese fishing vessel known as the Lucky Dragon. It Happened.\nSailors. Died. Fishing.\nSounds like a hiku.\nThere are no hiku’s in The Fall of Eden.\nI’ve always thought the definition of art is the discovery of the coke bottle and what the coke bottle is doing in Nevil Shute’s “On The Beach”. (If you want pass the acid test, Google Nuclear Holocausts: Atomic War In Fiction by Paul Brians). After you google you tell me. Or for that matter tell Michael Richards.\nComic Con.\nI would never want to go on a book tour promoting The Fall Of Eden. I get the jeebs just thinking about having to sit behind a folding table and Hancocking my name to a line of expectant fans. The smell of the magic marker. The eye contact. The hoping for some kind of intimacy… which for me as an artist who spends the majority of his time alone in a room is unimaginable, scary, draining. “I’m sorry, how do you spell your name again?”\nI have this macabre vision of a Jewish Rabbi walking backwards up an escalator. I remember seeing this vision in Spirits of the Dead, in an episode titled Toby Dammit, directed by Frederico Fellini loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘Never Bet The Devil Your Head’. “Ambition above the ordinary.” There’s nothing ambitious about The Fall of Eden. That’s why Richard Michaels is going to have to go out and sign the book himself.\nThe Cliff Notes:\n“Become a sniper. Take aim. Hold your breath. Kill people without remorse.\n“We began living at the mercy of the wind.”\n“My military buddies are dead. So are all of your friends. Everyone back at school? All dead. Or about to die. Real soon… Everyone you ever knew, except us.”\nThe Fall Of Eden, The Berkley Publishing Group, published by the Penguin Group.\nBy Richard Michaels\nOn the lower left of colophon after the ISBN number it says: 1. Family vacations---Fiction. 2. Caribbean Area---Fiction. 3. Terrorism----United States---Fiction.\nOn the cover of the book, under an illustration of a man running out of a jungle towards a beach its says… “The end of the world is just beginning…” On the back cover above the same illustration, only smaller, its says,\n“Imagine a world without technology, without governments without civilization. A world in which you must fight for EVERYTHING.\nOn page 306, the second to the last page it says, “People need to die so that we can keep living.”\nI picked up the Fall Of Eden in an airport kiosk six years ago. I read what was on page 307, (the last page), before I paid for the book.\nThis “review” was supposed to appear this June in the NYT’s Book Review. Yesterday I heard from the editor. She wrote in an email, “this is a six page piece of writing. It is not clear to me how you expected this to be photographed for the Book Review. Obviously, we cannot have you review a book that you wrote yourself. How could we unveil a book that has already been in wide distribution since 2009?”\nRed Flags.\n“Photograph.”\n“Yourself.”\n“Unveil.”\n“Wide.”\n4/10/2015\nOriginal\nOriginal Patent for perforated toilet paper.\nSeth Wheeler’s original patent for his perforated toilet paper invention was issued in 1891.\nApparently Wheeler, even back then, knew people would be prone to using to much paper in the john.\n“In carrying out my invention the sheets of paper are only partially separated, having their points of attachment arranged in a novel manner, whereby each sheet will easily separate from the series as it is drawn from the roll, there being no litter occasioned, and any waste of paper is thereby prevented”, he wrote in the patent.\nWheeler’s toilet paper was 4.5 inches wide.\nMusician says Universal Music has hijacked his YouTube videos with bogus copyright claims.\nTorrentFreak.com reports on the story of Norwegian musician Bjorn Lynne, who says that UMG has twice taken over the ads on You Tube clips of his music by falsely claiming copyright violations.\nHis most recent example involves the video for a tune called “Kingdom of the Persians”, from his soundtrack for the Seven Kingdoms video game.\nUnfortunately, it looks like UMG took the step of putting that audiobook recording into the You Tube Content-ID system. When the copyright bots matched up Lynne’s recording to the background music of the audiobook, he received an automated copyright notice saying that ads would be placed on his video and that Universal would get the money.\nLynne says he can understand the confusion arising from the automated system. However, when he filed a written dispute with You Tube about the claim, he was ultimately told that UMG had determined they were the rightful holders of the copyright and that the “ads will stay.”\n“The only reasonable thing to do here, for me, says Lynne, would be to hire a top lawyer to go after them legally. But realistically, it’s like $350 per hour for a lawyer and a 3-hour minimum for a case, so I’m looking at over $1,000 just to get something started.\nThe Original Pancake House was founded in Portland Oregon in 1953 by Les Highet and Erma Hueneke. Drawing upon their many years of experience in the culinary field, and their extensive working knowledge of authentic national and ethnic pancake recipes they were able to offer without compromise this unique and original menu which has gained national acclaim. The Original Pancake House is a second and third generation family business, which takes pride in maintaining the high standards that make food outstanding. They have over one hundred franchises from coast to coast. Only the finest ingredients are used. A 93 score butter. Pure 36% whipping cream, fresh grade AA eggs, hard wheat unbleached flour, and their own recipe sourdough starter. Batters and sauces are made fresh in each restaurant’s kitchen.\nIn 2010 I made a book called Betty Kline. I combined photos of the pin up queen Betty Page and the Ab-Ex’er Franz Kline. I had known about Betty Page for years and had always been a huge fan of Franz Kline. I knew the whole back story of Betty Page… how in the early fifties she hooked up with Irving Klaw and his sister and how the three of them produced bondage photographs which they sold thru a mail order company which Klaw had established to peddle “smutt”. I knew Klaw’s studio was located across the street from Kline’s studio on 14th St. This was 1952. I wrote in the introduction of the book how Franz and Betty were an item. How Franz got his inspiration from the graphics of Betty’s bondage photos. I wrote about the inspiration as “the real story.” How instead of inner turmoil and psychological angst, abstract expression was about sex. The juxtaposition of Page’s photos and Kline’s paintings made a convincing argument. I remember when I first told this story to a curator at DIA back in 1992, she got so mad at me, she walked out of my studio and called me an idiot. I think mostly, she was frustrated. Like her whole theory base idea of what art history was suppose to be was suddenly fractured. A melt down. Her walls came tumbling down. Her mind split open. She was confused to, because \"my telling\" was serious. I told it like she should of known about what I was saying without me saying it. \"You mean you don't know this about Betty and Franz\"? I believed what I was saying was true. I told the story with a straight face.\n3/18/2015\nFashion.\nI lived at 438 East 12th between 1st and Ave. A in a tiny rent controlled “railroad” apartment… the kind with the tub in the kitchen.\nI worked at Time-Life. I had just left my job working in the Time-Life employee’s bookstore and got a job working in one of their other departments called “copy processing.” One day a week. The day was actually a night. A graveyard shift, starting at six pm and ending the next morning at six am. Twelve hours. A super shift.\nCopy processing was a boring, mindless job. I can’t even begin to describe how stupid it was except to say that the job required me to send endlessly corrected stories to the different magazines the stories were written for. The corrections had something to do with fitting the copy into the margin. I think they called it “justifying” the copy. These stories came off a Teletype machine, in carbon triplicates, and I had to separate the carbons from the typescripts and shove the “scripts” up pneumatic tubes where they would get sucked away to another floor, another room, in another part of the building. What would take seconds now took hours back in ‘82-‘84. The job was labor, repetitive. There were no decisions involved. There was a lot of down time. Sometimes copy wouldn’t show up for hours. These hours gave me plenty of time for other things. My things. I had been working for Time-Life for seven years in different departments and in those seven years I came to see the building as a giant dystopian novel. The building was open seven days a week, 24 hours a day. It had a cafeteria, small apartments for sleepovers, a post office, it’s own hospital, a gym, clothing stores on the mezzanine. The building was connected to an underground passageway that connected to more passageways that connected to Rockefeller Center. If you wanted to, you could spend a lifetime never having to go outside.\nIn 1982 Time-Life published seven magazines.\nEvery Monday, People and Time magazines would come out. When I got to work I’d pour thru them looking for a new Marlboro Ad. This would make my dead-end job seem less dead. Looking thru a brand new magazine has always excited me. I’m not sure why. Being next to someone else’s world is the best way I can describe it. It was especially exciting back then because I was “tearing” the “cowboys” and the expectations of finding a good one, one that I could use… added to the excitement. I was re-photographing the ads with color slide film and sending the slides off to a to a lab in Kansas, waiting a couple of days to get a roll of 36 “transparencies” back in the mail. After the wait, I’d spread them out on my light box and sit and shuffle them around and try to pick out the “good one.” (Opening up a new box of “developed” slides was the best part of what was next).\nSo 1982-84.\nThe Cowboys.\nI was also taking two hour breaks from midnight to two am and walking from the Time-Life building into Times Square and make believing I was in the middle of the movie ‘The Sweet Smell of Success’. This “make believe” turned into “The Entertainers.” A series of eleven photographs based on the visual “stuff” that came out of hanging around Times Square. Times Square was a different place back in ‘83. I’ve written about the experience in my book Why I Go To The Movies Alone in 1983. I got involved in trying to make a photograph not from a magazine but from an environment. The Entertainers were eleven “head shots” of actors and actresses trying to make it in show business. They were mostly people whose biggest accomplishment would have been to appear on the Joe Franklin show. I was interested in people who changed their names and even came up with new ways of spelling the name they changed the name to. I made these portraits with “graphics” that came straight out of Times Square. The razzmatazz. All the noise and dazzle that was meant to attract attention. I tried to make a photograph that looked like it was impossible to make. Like it had been “sent away” for. I schooled myself in getting to know how to transfer images into direct positives and how to put an image on acetate. I also became pretty good at “re-touching”… a photographic term I associated with being a professional and something that “art directors” would do to a photograph after it was handed in and needed to be “fixed”. I presented The Entertainers in large 4X8’ Plexiglas black boxes that tried to mimic some of the “displays” I had seen outside of adult theaters. The off and on light bulbs… the neon… “the special effects.” It was all in the box. I leaned the boxes up against the wall, putting them on a small 5” “stage” that I built on the floor so they would have a little lift. The small stage gave them just enough independence from where the crease of the floor and wall came together. I showed the Entertainers once in Valencia and again in ‘92 at my Whitney retrospective.\nSo 1982-84.\nThe Entertainers.\nI also had no gallery. I had been with Metro Pictures and had two shows with them but not much happened. I showed my early re-photographs first. Three Women Looking To The Left. One Man Looking In Three Different Directions. Man’s Hand With Cigarette. Four Pens. Some watches, jewelry and a pocketbook. I also showed a piece called Untitled, (Men and Women. Men and Men. Women and Women). All the photographs had been originally torn from advertisements that I’d been collecting from 1977 to ‘79 when I worked in a department called “tear sheets” at Time-Life. The second show at Metro was called “Sunsets” (1981). Eleven photographs that also came from advertisements that ended up looking like science fiction. (Not my original intention). I had been selecting ads that used the colors red and yellow. Not sure why. Pattern recognition. The photos were post apocalyptic. (Again, not my intention). One Sunset sold. Or maybe I traded it. I don’t know. I only know, because I saw it in Lena Dunham’s film Tiny Furniture on the wall of Carroll Dunham and Laurie Simmons loft. (Carroll and Laurie and I were friends and Carroll also worked at Time-Life).\nWhere was I?\nNo gallery.\nIn 1983 I photographed Spiritual America. I wanted this photograph to be my third show at Metro. They had just moved from Mercer St. to a new huge space on Greene St. When I told them my idea… one photo… (I don’t think I showed them the photo)… they passed and it was time for me to leave.\nI really thought Spiritual America WAS photography.\nI opened up my own gallery to show the photograph. 5 Rivington Street… even lower Manhattan. I called the gallery Spiritual America and hired a woman to beard the place.\n1982-84\nSpiritual America.\nThis is maybe why “Fashion” is being shown for the first time at Joe Nahmad’s gallery. I’ve always worked on several bodies of work at the same time. Some get shown, some don’t. I think I showed one Fashion out in L.A. with Richard Kulenschmidt in ’84. But I can’t remember the details. Richard had a gallery in his apartment. He showed Louise Lawler. I think he showed Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger, James Casebere. I know he showed James Welling. Richard had no money. And no one bought anything he showed. I had maybe three shows with Richard and it’s where I met Larry Johnson. Richard disappeared into the real estate world. I know when I last showed with him in 1984, I showed Untitled, (Woman In Compact), an image that was part of the Fashion but didn’t get into the gang. The Compact was a unique version, 60X40,” and it ended up in Jeff Ayeroff’s living room. Jeff worked at Warner Bros. Records. Pretty high up. He signed Madonna. Prince. The Ramones. The Talking Heads. Television. Jonathan Richman. Eno. The B 52’s. We became friends and he gave me access to the publicity files at Warner Bros. I would spend hours in the basement going thru all the publicity pics of all the bands that were signed to Warner Bros. All the 8X10’ glossies that the bands would pose for. Jeff said, “take as many as you want, we’ve got plenty.”\nJeff’s Untitled (Woman With Compact) ended up on the cover of Hal Foster’s first book, The Anti-Aesthetic, Essays on Postmodern Culture. The book was popular and went thru many printings. I’m not sure why, but Hal took my photograph off the cover and replaced it with a photo by Sherrie Levine. Politics. The art police. Who knows? He didn’t like Spiritual America and the fallout it created and the complications the image “imagined”. It was an uncomfortable photograph. I don’t think he wanted to be associated with an image of a girl who looked like a woman. I can’t blame him. Who did? I lost a lot of friends over that photo. I think he should have replaced my Untitled (Woman With Compact) with Stieglitz’s own Spiritual America. That would have been cool.\n1982-84.\n“Fashion.”\nIt was always my position, when I re-photographed an image from a magazine with color slide film… it was the slide, “the chrome,” that was the work of art. Since the slide is a negative AND a “positive,” you can hold it up to the light a see what you took. You didn’t necessarily have to make a print of the slide and especially make one if you couldn’t afford to make one. Overhead. All you needed was the slide.\nI started organizing my slides according to subject matter and things that looked the same. I wasn’t interested in repetition. I wasn’t interested in mechanical. I wasn’t interested in industrial. I wasn’t interested in new. I was interested in “again.”\nI was also interested in agreement. Agreement took some of the subjectivity out of the equation and introduced the possibility of fact. I wanted to tell the truth. And if I couldn’t, I wanted to try. I had grown up during the cold war. Suspicion, distrust, Spy Vs. Spy. I didn’t believe in much. And I didn’t trust in much either. Truth or Consequences. To Tell The Truth. Who Do You Trust. What’s My Line. You Bet Your Life. Game shows. That’s what I grew up with.\nThe nine “fashion” images look like this because that’s the way they should look. I organized the nine slides on my light box and kind of “d’jayed them around until I hit the right balance. All the images had something to do with “covering” and when I finally found the right rhythm, I taped the slides together with scotch tape and sent them to my lab. I hate to get technical, but I had already known if I taped the slides… using the slide mounts as a place to attach the tape to, I could get at least nine slides to fit on an 8X10” inter-negative and then have that inter-negative blown up onto one piece of photo paper. The process was called “ganging” together. It was a common way of archiving your work… putting together many images on one piece of paper and putting that piece of paper in a folder, a book, a place where you could remind yourself of what you had done.\n(By the end of ’84 I would change what I was looking at because of this way of working. It was seamless. Having nine images in one frame was like having a whole show. I re-photographed images that I wouldn’t necessarily think about because I could put them in one frame and not have to hang them individually on a wall and take up a lot of gallery space. I’m not sure if you follow… but I don’t think I would of re-photographed biker chicks, heavy metal bands, monster trucks, criminals and celebrities, big wave surfing, muscle cars, war pictures, cartoons, and sexually explicit text if it hadn’t been for “the gang”).\nIn 1982-84, the lab that I was working with had just gotten in a 50” drum that could process a new type of ektacolor photo paper that was 50” wide. (A lab in Dusseldorf would soon get the same drum. I would meet Thomas Ruff soon after and we’d trade and I would get one of his king size portraits). The paper came in a roll. A LARGE roll. I suppose if you wanted to, you could make a photograph 100 feet long. The width was the only limitation. I asked my lab, “what about taking my “gang” of nine slides and blowing them up on this new paper.” “How big would each image be… given the limitation of the width?” The lab tried it and each image came out to around 11X13”, pretty close to the original size of the image I was looking at before I tore it out of the magazine. The space between each image on the gang was the space created by the slide mount. So far so good. Back in 1982-84 I didn’t want excitement and I didn’t want to be exciting. I wanted to be solid. As far as I can remember the “fashion” image was the first gang. The height of the gang hadn’t been decided on, so I just cut the photo roll with a pair of scissors. (Beginning in 1984 all the of “gangs” would be 48X86”). When I walked into Joe’s gallery and saw the Fashion gang, I had forgotten that I had written on it. “Annotated”. Annotation is associated with book collecting and I’m a book collector so there was a nice association between the surprise and what I collected. I also remember that “straight” photographers would mark their contact sheets with grease pencil. Using a red grease pencil to mark a choice. I think “greasing” up the Fashion gang was another way of using what was a “photographic given.” By 1982-84 I was taking advantage of a bunch of terms that were “ordinary” to most photographers. “Retouching” was something I was trying out. Trying to X-out the flaws, the hairs, the dust, the mistakes, “the imperfections”… were all part of the fashion process. I was doing what they were doing. It sounds artificial, but I didn’t want to make anything up.\nI even thought about “the edition.”\nI knew most photographers paid little attention to photography’s “natural ability” to reproduce. When it came to editioning a print, most photographers “open ended” their edition. They put no limits on the number of prints they made. They made a copy when someone asked for a copy. A good example is George Tice Petit’s Mobil Station Cherry Hill N.J. 1974, from his Patterson New Jersey series. It’s maybe Tice’s best-known photograph. I went to the Witkin Gallery in the early nineties wanting to buy a copy and they said, “fine… we’ll tell him to go ahead and print one. He prints on demand. And he prints in different sizes according to what’s demanded.” I got copy number 256. A small one. That was like twenty years ago. I still have it hanging in my studio. I’m not sure if he knew or anybody cares to know, but there’s a 1970-71 ‘Cuda parked in front of the gas station.\nI stepped back.\nI wanted to make my photographs more into objects, so I decided to make editions of two with one artist’s proof. And if I made any prints big, they would be unique.\nI think edition’s of two is a mind blower.\nIt works. It’s the perfect number. Not unique but almost.\nI don’t know where the big fashions went. For all my “considerations” I didn’t keep track of the who what and where’s that happened after I showed my work. It’s not like in 1982-84 I had a lot to keep track of.\nThe individual ‘fashions’ from the gang were printed in ‘84 and I know one of them wound up in a girlfriend’s apartment. The one with the comb. I know, because I gave it to her. I know too, because before she hung “the comb”, there was a Basquiat on the wall which I asked her to take down and put in the closet.\nThere are other photographs that belong with the Fashions. For a while I referred to them as “generic” photographs. As I said before, I got pretty good at re-touching and I would take a picture of a guy drinking a soda and get rid of the name on the soda can. This “getting rid of” made everything “even.” I took a box of cereal with a rabbit on it and got rid of any reference to the brand. I took the smiley face on the pitcher of Kool-Aid and got rid of the Kool-Aid. I took hair products and blacked out any reference of how to re-color your hair. I took a box of condoms and left only the logo. (Ramb). I took a Ralph Lauren bottle of perfume and focused on the graphic of the polo player. This is 1982-84. Ralph Lauren. Perfume. Polo Player. An artist friend said to me when he saw this image in the back room of Joe’s… “what the fuck?”\nGood question.\nI think “what the fuck” is a good answer.\nIt’s kind of like asking Bob Dylan why he wrote “Clothes Line Saga”.\nI remember ‘82,‘84 everybody painting. At least that’s what everybody seemed to be doing. I wanted to paint too. But I didn’t have anything to paint. (That wouldn’t come until later. It wouldn’t be until ‘86 that I finally found something to paint… jokes).\nIn ‘82-‘84 re-photographing a perfume bottle that was designed by Ralph Lauren with a guy riding a horse swinging a polo mallet wasn’t art. Both the process and subject matter wasn’t art. But the process and subject was a good marriage. It made sense and it turned what wasn’t into what would become.\nIn 1984 I got a job working for Mademoiselle. My girlfriend was the art director. (Same girl I gave the comb to.) It was a “secret” job. She didn’t tell the heads of Mademoiselle what I was doing. What I was doing was picking the photograph that would appear on the cover. Once a month I would get a thousand slides of the same model taken by someone like Albert Watson and pick one out that I thought would look good on the cover. I did nine covers. I was with the girlfriend for nine months. It was the best job I ever had. At the end of December ‘84 I had a nervous breakdown, quit working for Time-Life, and moved to Venice Beach Calif. I stopped looking at People, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, Time, Harpers Bazaar, Vogue, Marie Clare, Redbook and Town and Country and started to look at ‘In The Wind.’ I was finally on my own. Hanging out at those giant outdoor magazine racks that took up half the boulevard across from Canter’s on Las Cienega.

The way had nothing to do with the tradition of portraiture.\nIf you wanted me to do your portrait, you would give me at least five photographs that had already been taken of yourself, that were in your possession, (you owned them, they were yours), and more importantly… you were already happy with.\nYou give me the five you liked and I would pick the one I liked. I would re-photograph the one I liked and that would be your portrait. Simple. Direct. To the point…\nFoolproof.\nI started off doing friends. Peter Nadin. Anne Kennedy. Jeff Koons. Cookie Mueller. Gary Indiana. Colin DeLand.\nThey didn’t have to sit for their portrait. They didn’t have to make an appointment and come over and sit in front of some cyclone or in front a neutral background or on an artists stool. They didn’t have to show up at all. And they wouldn’t be disappointed with the result. How could they? It wasn’t like they were giving me photos of themselves that were embarrassing.\nSocial Science Fiction.\nAnother advantage was the “time-line.” If you were in your sixties and you gave me a photograph that had been taken thirty years earlier, and that’s the one I chose, your portrait ended up in a kind of time machine. I couldn’t go forward, but I could go backwards. Vanity. Most of the people I did liked the younger version of themselves. So the future didn’t really matter. Half of H.G. Wells was better than no half at all.\nWho knew?\nAfter friends, I did people I didn’t know.\nI had access to Warner Brother Records and their publicity files. The files were filled with 8 x 10 glossies of recording stars that they had under contract. How I had access is beside the point. It was a long time ago. Let’s just say an A&R guy gave me access, “permission.”\nI spent time in their LA headquarters, Burbank, and went thru the metal cabinets and took the “publicities” I wanted, took them home, put them in front of my camera and made a new photograph. The first one I did was Dee Dee Ramone.\nI did Tina Weymouth, Tom Verlaine, Jonathan Richman, Laurie Anderson. I did the two girls from the B-52’s.\nNot knowing these people, having never met them, or talked to them, but still being able to do their portrait, excited me. Satisfaction. I spent weeks in the basement of Warner Bros. I thought I had an advantage. My method, if you could call it that, was far more flexible than the regular way portraits were taken. I didn’t need a studio. A darkroom. A receptionist. A calendar. Make-up. Stylists. I didn’t have to deal with agents or the “personality,” good or bad, of the sitter. My overhead was minimal and I could do the portrait all by myself.\nBy myself. That was the best.\nWhy I Go To The Movies Alone.\nAt first I thought this could be a business.\nUp till then none of the art that I was making sold… or sold enough to make a living. I had just quit my job at Time-Life the year before and was trying to make a go of it living near Venice Beach in LA… sharing a house with three roommates and living off the occasional sales that Hudson, my friend from Chicago, would make selling my “cartoon” drawings.\nThis idea of a “portrait business” made sense to me. Who wouldn’t want their portrait done this way?\nI continued to do friends. Paula Grief. Dike Blair. Myer Viceman. I did everybody’s portrait for Wild History, a book that I put together for Tanam Press of downtown writing. The author’s portrait accompanied their contribution. Warton Tiers. Spaulding Grey. Tina L’Hostky.\nBy the end of ‘84 it was over.\nI’m not sure if it was the lack of interest in me, or others. (My energy evaporated). Maybe it was the inability to convince people to commit to a commission. It was a good idea but after doing about forty of them I put them in a draw and moved on. Bored? Restless? I don’t know. Let’s just say it didn’t take off.\nLeave it at that.\nMy cartoon drawings turned into jokes and the jokes started taking up everything. In the end, I think most people would rather have their portrait done by Robert Mapplethorpe.\nThirty Years. Time passes.\nThe social network.\nI looked over my daughter’s shoulder and saw that she was scrolling thru pictures on her phone. I asked her what she was looking at. “It’s my Tumbler.” “What’s a Tumbler,” I asked.\nThat was… four years ago?\nAbout three years ago I bought an iPhone. Someone had shown me the photographs you could take with the phone. I had given up taking pictures after they got rid of color slide film. I tried digital but couldn’t make the adjustment. I never liked carrying a camera and was pretty much ink jetting and painting anyway… so the idea of using a big boxy camera with all its new whistles and bows wasn’t for me.\nEnter the sandman.\nThe iPhone was just what I needed. I couldn’t believe how easy it was to point and shoot. You didn’t have to focus. You didn’t have to load film. You didn’t have to ASA. You didn’t have to set a speed. The clarity...\nI could see for miles.\nThe photos you took were stored in the phone. And when you wanted to see them they appeared on a grid. The best part, you could send a photo immediately to a friend, to an e-mail, to a printer… or, you could organize your photos, like my daughter had, and post them publicly or privately.\nWhen worlds collide.\nI asked my daughter more about Tumbler. Are those your photos? Where did you get that one? Did you need permission? How did you get that kind of crop? You can delete them? Really? What about these “followers.” Who are they? Are they people you know? What if you don’t want to share? How many of your friends have tumblers?\nWhat’s yours is mine.\nMy daughter’s “grid” on Tumbler reminded me of my “Gangs” I did back in ’85… where I organized a set of nine images on a single piece of photo paper and blew the paper up to 86 x 48”. The gangs were a way to deal with marginal or subsets of lifestyles that I needed to see on a wall but not a whole wall. Each gang was it’s own exhibition. Girlfriends, Heavy Metal Bands, Giant waves, Big Foot Trucks, Sex, War, Cartoons, Lyrics… were all re-photographed with slide film and when the slides returned they were “d-jay’d” and moved around on a custom made light box until the best nine made the cut. The “cut” was then tapped together, (the edges of the slide mounts were pushed up against each other and scotched taped), the nine taped slides were sent to a lab where an 8 x 10 inter-negative was made, and from the inter-negative the final photo was blown up. I’ve probably lost you. Technical stuff… application and technique. Sometimes it’s better to leave the “background” out of it. Better to “take it for granted.” Why should I care how a photograph is made?\nOnly sometimes.\nHow was it called back then? Sampling?\nPrimitive now, but back then… a fifty inch photo drum was few and far between. The paper was 50 inches wide and came in a huge roll. If you wanted to, you could take a roll and roll it down the street, roll it down the sidewalk, roll it all the way down the West Side Highway.\nShakespeare’s in the alley?\nNo. Philip Roth is in the alley.\nJoan Didion is in the alley.\nDon Delillo is in the alley.\nWhat’s up pussycat?\nThere’s a lot of cats on Instagram. Food too.\nAnd there’s tons of photos of people who take photographs of themselves. (Yes I know the word).\nOn the gram. I was just asked why do I like Instagram. I said, “Because there’s rules. And if you break the rules, you get kicked off.”\nI got to Instagram thru Twitter.\nTwitter first.\nI’m not sure when I first started tweeting, but I liked trying to fit a whole story into 140 characters.\nI call it Birdtalk.\nI use to Bird in the early nineties for Purple Magazine and birded in my first catalogue for Barbara Gladstone in ’87.\nShort sentences that were funny, sweet, dumb, profound, absurd, stupid, jokey, Finnegan’s Wake meets Mad Magazine meets ad copy for Calvin Kline. Think Dylan’s Tarantula. Then think some more and think Kathy Acker’s Tarantula.\nOr, don’t think at all. I know I don’t.\nSometimes.\nSometimes I write down the first sentence that starts off my favorite novel.\nRelative. I’m not much of a theory guy. But sometimes I think there was a reason why Einstein was a technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office.\nLet me fill your cup.\nTwitter accepts photos but is mainly text based. I like to combine the two and tweet both photo and text.\nI called the photo/texts tweets I was posting… “The Family”.\nI posted photos of my extended family… mother, brother, sister, nieces, cousins, uncles, aunts, in-laws, step children, boy and girlfriends. I would caption the photos with a short description of who, what, why… measuring my words so that they fit into the guidelines of the platform.\nAfter posting the photo/text, I sent the information to my printer and ink jetted an 11 x 14” print of the marriage. I made thirty-eight “Family” tweets.\nDistribution.\nI placed each Family Tweet in a plastic sleeve and push-pinned the sleeve to the wall. The wall was at Karma. I put all 38 up. Salon style. It was Saturday. The doors opened at 12. By 12:15pm all 37 were gone. One to a customer. I kept the one that had my father, mother, and sister in it. (My father and mother were naked, and my sister was sitting in between. My family wasn’t like yours. Hobnob doesn’t begin to describe them). I sold the “family tweets” for $12 each. First come, first serve.\nWell, well, well…\nIn ma ma ma my wheeeeeeeel house.\nI use to stutter. By the ninth grade, the sparkle was in my eye. It got so bad the impediment turned me into a clam. I slept all day, everyday. I wouldn’t get up until Sunday. I waited for Bonanza to come on the TV. I loved the cowboy father and his three sons.\nTwo summers ago my niece was working for me out on Long Island and she showed me how to screen save. I didn‘t know about the option. What other options don’t I know about?\nScreen Save.\nThis might be one of the best applications in an apparatus that I’ve ever encountered. All time. Hall of fame. First place. Just what I need. MORE photographs.\nPressing the two buttons on the phone and hearing the device grind its gears to make an exposure made me nervous. What did Harry Lyme say in the movie The Third Man? “In three centuries of civilization what have the Swiss contributed to culture? The Cuckoo Clock.”\nHey kids… what time is it?\nNow I have a theory.\nI was beside myself.\nCongratulations.\nThis past Spring, and half the Summer, the iPhone became my studio. I signed up for Instagram. I pushed things aside. I made room. It was easy. I ignored Tumbler, and Facebook had never interested me. But Instagram…\nI started off being RichardPrince4.\nI quickly recognized the device was a way to get the lead out. If Twitter was editorial… then Instagram was advertising.\nA gazzilion people.\nBesides cats, dogs, and food, people put out photos of themselves and their friends all the time, everyday, and yes, some people put themselves out twice on Monday’s. I started “following” people I knew, people I didn’t know and people who knew each other. It was innocent. I was on the phone talking to Jessica Hart and had just looked at her “gram” feed before picking up the phone. I asked about a picture she posted of herself standing in front of a fireplace wearing what looked to be ski clothes and big fur boots. The post was in black and white, head to toe, full figure and behind her, above the mantle, there was a portrait of Bridget Bardot. I told her someone should make a portrait out this photo. She said, “why don’t you?”\nCome to think of it.\nI’m not sure if she knew about my Family Tweets. She might of. I think we even talked about them after she came to my studio for a visit. After I got off the phone I thought about her suggestion “why don’t you.”\nI went back to her feed and screen saved her “winter” photo. I sent the save to my computer, pressed “empty subject”, pressed “actual size” and waited for it to appear in a doc, checked the margins and crop, clicked on the doc and sent it to my printer. My ink jet printer printed out an 11 x 14 inch photo on paper… I took the photo out of the tray and put it on my desk.\nLooking at Jessica’s feed reminded me of 1984. Except this time I had more than five photos to choose from. I went back to her feed a second time. I scrolled thru maybe a hundred photos she had posted and looked at all the ones that included her. The one in front of the fireplace was still the best.\nWalk on.\nJessica had tons of followers. Thousands. And a lot of them had “commented” on what she posted. I read all the comments that had been posted under her fireplace photo. There was one comment I wish I could of gotten in my original screen save. When you screen save an Instagram image you can get maybe three, four comments in the save if you include the persons “profile” icon that appears on the upper left of the page. I decided early on I wanted the persons icon to be part of the save. But what else could I save?\nI went back to my desk and kept starring at the print out of Jessica. What do I do now?\nI didn’t want to paint it.\nI didn’t want to mark it.\nI didn’t want to add a sticker.\nWhatever I did, I wanted it to happen INSIDE and before the save. I wanted my contribution to be part of the “gram.” I didn’t want to do anything physical to the photograph after it was printed.\nFive cents.\nI went back to the comment.\nI commented on the Jessica’s photo in front of the fireplace but my comment was one of hundreds and showed up outside, way down at the bottom… out of the frame.\nIf I wanted my comment to show up near her picture…how?\nI got lucky.\nI’m terrible when it comes to the tech side of technology. But somehow I figured out how hack into Jessica’s feed and swipe away all her comments and add my own so that it would appear under her post. The hack is pretty simple and anyone can do it. You hit the grey comment bar and pick a comment you don’t want and swipe with you finger to the left and a red exclamation mark appears. You press on the exclamation mark and four things come onto the bottom of your screen.\n1. Why are you reporting this comment?\n2. Spam or Scam\n3. Abusive Content\n4. Cancel\nTo get rid of the comment you click on Spam or Scam. It’s gone. Just like that I could control other peoples comments and Jessica’s own comments. And the comment that I added could now be near enough Jessica’s photo that when I screen saved it, my comment would “show up”. Make sense? It’s about as good as I can do. What can I say? Einstein and cuckoo...\nSo now...\nSo now I was in.\nWaiting to follow.\nRichardprince4 would appear at the bottom of Jessica’s final portrait. My comment, whatever it would be, would always be the last comment. The last say so. Say so. That’s good. That could work. My “in” was what I ended up saying. And what I would say would be everything I ever knew… what I knew now and what I would know in the future.\nTell Me Everything.\nFinnegan’s Wake meets Mad Magazine.\nZoot Horn Rollo. You seem to be where I belong. (emoji).\nThe first three portraits I did were of women I knew. Or almost knew. Jessica, I knew. Pam Anderson, I knew. Sky Ferreira? I didn’t know, but was following her and had been reading about her new album and seeing posters of her album broadsided on sheets of ply on the Bowery and on Lafayette near Bond. I wasn’t sure what I was doing or why I chose these three. I just had lunch with Pam and had seen Jessica in LA. Sky I was following because she seemed interesting. There was nothing more. No attraction. No fan. No desire. No date. No wanting anything from her. And the pictures she posted were candid, boozy and seemed to be letting the viewer in on some kind of backstage diary. She also had thousands of people following her and I could tap into her followers and follow them. I can do that? I didn’t even know I could follow the followers. Like I said, the hardware was all new… and I was just getting started.\nThe shoreline is never the same. (Like it should be).\nWhen I first started getting rid of comments I thought the person who’s comments I was getting rid of might get pissed. “What happen to all my comments?” I found out quickly that “the getting rid of” only affected my feed. The deleted comments didn’t affect the followers feed. Their comments were still there even though they were gone from mine. All that happened is that MY comment showed up below their photo. Was I allowed? Yes. I guess so. It’s hard to explain. But the process is open, and at the moment, it’s the way it works and anyone and everyone can do it.\nThe language I started using to make “comments” was based on Birdtalk. Non-sequitur. Gobblygook. Jokes. Oxymorons. “Psychic Jujitsu”.\nSome of the language came directly from TV. If I’m selecting a photo of someone and adding a comment to their gram and an advertisement comes on… I use the language that I hear in the ad. Inferior language. It works. It sounds like it means something. What’s it mean? I don’t know. Does it have to mean anything at all? I think about James Joyce confessing to Nora Barnacle. I think about opening up to page three hundred and twenty-three of Finnegan’s Wake. Then I think about notes and lyricism. Policy. Whisper. Murmurs. Mantra. Quotation. Advice.\nChamber Music.\nDidn’t Duke Ellington say, “If it sounds good, it is good.” He did say that, didn’t he?\nWho are these people?\nLarry Clark, Diane Arbus, Robert Mapplethorpe take great portraits. I’ve watched Larry take photos and I don’t know how he does it. I wouldn’t know where to begin. I could never go up to a stranger and ask them if I could take their picture. I’ve done it maybe two or three times and didn’t enjoy it. That part of art is in Larry. It isn’t in me. I feel more comfortable in my bedroom looking thru Easy Rider and pouring over pictures of “girlfriends” that are right there on the page. Page after page. Looking. Wondering. Anticipating. Hoping. What will be on the next page? Will I find a girlfriend that I really like? That’s my relationship with what’s out there. It’s as close as I want to get. That’s what’s in me.\nIG is a bedroom magazine.\nI can start out with someone I know and then check out who they follow or who’s following them, and the rabbit hole takes on an outer body experience where you suddenly look at the clock and it’s three in the morning. I end of up on people’s grids that are so far removed from where I began, it feels psychedelic. Further. I’m on the bus. I feel like I’m part of Kesey’s merry tribe. I’m reminded of Timothy Leary’s journals which I purchased years ago from John McWhinnie and the concentration that came over me when I discovered his hand drawn map of his escape from jail. How he literally shimmied on a wire that had been strung up from an outer utility building to the perimeter prison wall… and how I would trace with my finger his overland express to Tangier, where he hooked up with Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver and spent the next year seeking asylum in different parts of North Africa, ultimately ending up Switzerland where his ex-wife ratted him out and how fighting extradition, took up the rest of his life). Wow, now it’s four in the morning.\nTune In, Turn On, Come Out.\n“Trolling.”\nIf you say so.\nI never thought about it that way. The word has been used to describe part of the process of making my new portraits. I guess so. It’s not like I’m on the back of a boat throwing out chum.\n\"We're going to need a bigger boat.\"\nIncluded.\nEveryone is fair.\nGame.\nAn even playing field.\n“Outside my cabin door. Said the girl from the red river shore.”\nMen. Women. Men and women. Men and men. Women and women. Blacks Whites Latinos Asian Arabs Jews Straights Gays Transgender. Tatoos and scars. Hairy.\nI don’t really know the score.\nThe ones I adore.\nI just know where I belong.\n“Oh, there I go. From a man to a memory.”\nHow do I tell you who or why I pick. I can’t. It would be like telling you why do I pick that joke. WHY THAT ONE? There’s thousands of jokes. I read them all. It takes days to read just one joke book. 101 Of The World’s Funniest Jokes. Days. If I get one, find one, like one, out of the 101, it’s a good day.\nPeople on IG lead me to other people. I spend hours surfing, saving, and deleting. Sometime I look for photos that are straight forward portraits. (Or at least look straight forward). Other times I look for photos that would only appear, or better still… exist on IG. Photos that look the way they do because they’re on the gram. Selfies? Not really. Self portraits. I’m not interested in abbreviation. I look for portraits that are upside down, sideways, at arms length, taken within the space that a body can hold a camera phone. What did DeKooning say? “When I spread my arms out, it’s all the space I need.”\nAt first I wasn’t sure how to print the portrait. I tired different surfaces, different papers. Presentation? Frame? Matt? Shadowbox? I tried them all. Finally this past spring my lab introduced me to a new canvas, one that was tightly wound, a surface with hardly any tooth. Smooth to the touch. Almost as if the canvas was photo paper. It was also brilliantly white. I don’t think it could be any whiter. And… the way the ink jetted into the canvas was a surprise. It fused in a way that made the image slightly out of focus. Just enough. The ink was IN and ON the canvas at the same time. When I first saw the final result I didn’t really know what I was looking at. A photographic work or a work on canvas? The surprise was perfect. Perfect doesn’t come along very often. The color that had been transferred from the file of the commuter to the jet, from jet to canvas, was intense, saturated, rich. If someone I followed had blue hair, their hair looked like it had been dyed directly onto the canvas. Dye job. Rinsed. Beauty salon. It was brilliant, great color. You might call it “vibrant”. The vibe between the image and the process was “sent a way for”, seamless, effortless… all descriptions I use to use when I tried describing my early “pens, watches and cowboys.” (Has it really been 40 years?) The ingredients, the recipe, “the manufacture,” whatever you want to call it… was familiar but had changed into something I had never seen before. I wasn’t sure it even looked like art. And that was the best part. Not looking like art. The new portraits were in that gray area. Undefined. In-between. They had no history, no past, no name. A life of their own. They’ll learn. They’ll find their own way. I have no responsibility. They do. Friendly monsters.\nSpeak for yourself.\nTo fit in the world takes time.\nFor now, all I can say is… they’re the only thing I’ve ever done that has made me happy.\n11/5/2014\nNew Figures\nMy parents were waiting for me when my plane landed in Boston. It was Jan. 1969. And I had just flown in from London after living in Europe for six months.\nThey had to wait an extra hour and half because after I came off the plane I was escorted by Customs and taken into a room and stripped searched for drugs. The authorities were convinced I had hash or peyote or some kind of illegal substance because my passport had a Moroccan stamp. Yes I’d been to Tangier’s. So what? I went there to track down Paul Bowles. Sheltering Sky was in my backpack. Rite of passage. When I arrived in Boston, I had long hair, a sheepskin coat from Copenhagen and crushed purple velvet pants that were slightly flared at the bottom that I bought on Carnaby Steet. I had beads made out of dried coffee beans around my neck. The cuffs of my shirt were extended all the way to the ends of my fingers. The fabric was thin, almost see-thru and had a pattern sewn in black that looked like Sanskrit. Like I said, “London”. I’d seen the play Hair, and the movies “If” and “Wonder Wall”. I was carrying the Beatles “White Album” and The Doors “Waiting For The Sun”. I’m not sure what I looked liked… or what my look suggested to the authorities. Are you experienced? Whatever it was, it was something they weren’t familiar with.\nThey made me bend over and spread my ass. My cheeks and cavity were empty. The search surprised me. I wasn’t prepared. I was trying to think… “did I have any drugs on me”?\nMidnight Express.\nI was sweating. Breathing fast. Hyperventilating. I was freaked. I didn’t have the consciousness, the foresight, the “wear with all”… to tell them to “fuck off and die.”\n“Take a hike.”\nI wish I had been outraged, but I wasn’t. Refused? Resisted? Demanded a lawyer? Nope. Blindsided. Rights? What rights? What did I know about rights? I took the invasion like a sissy. They bullied me. They humiliated me. They invaded my ass. Gloved fingers went up my hole. Rubber gloves spiked my sphinx. I wish a drool of shit had shit out on his rented uniform. But nothing shit. Blank rectum. They found nothing and let me go.\nBack in the USSR.\nThe Pope Smokes Dope.\nI was pretty shook up. The experience left me “radicalized.” I’m not sure what the word meant at the time, except the word was attached to The Stooges, The MC5 and John Sinclair and that’s what I wanted to be attached to. Rebellion. Up Against The Wall. The Other Side. Kick Out The Jams.\nMotherfuckers.\nThat’s for sure.\nI knew I didn’t want anything to do with the shit the government was selling American citizens. I associated government with liars, cheats and criminals looking to skim off other people’s hard earned sweat. This of course coming from the informed philosophy of an experienced eighteen year old. Big deal right? Life of the party. Short end of the stick. What did I know? Nothing plenty.\nRichard Nixon, Spiro Agnew, scumbags. John Mitchell? Scumbag. Richard Colson hypocrite. John Dean pussy. People in government didn’t make anything. People in government didn’t create anything. People in government hid behind religion and called you a commie rat bastard. Billy fucking Graham. Roy fucking Cohen. Red Menace. Witch hunts. Hush money. Secret tapes. Deepthroat. Executive privilege. Third rate burglaries. Smoking guns and pardons. Clandestine. People in government were there because of a popularity contest.\nAbe Lincoln woke up from a five day drunk and said, “I freed who?”\nVolunteer’s For America?\nNot so fast.\nI needed something I could trust.\nI needed beauty.\nI wanted beauty.\nI made up my mind.\nBeauty.\nI returned to Southern Maine, to Nasson College, for the second half of my sophomore year. Nasson College was a “hippie” school. A bad version of Antioch. Full of freaks and heads who couldn’t get in anywhere else. The last train to Clarkesville.\nThere was a section of the college that had coed living and didn’t hand out grades. Progressive. Liberal. Freeform. An expensive commune. You could, if you wanted… sleep for four years.\nYou could go to the pool all day and swim. The breast stroke. The butterfly. The swan dive. Our valedictorian was a lifeguard.\nI stopped listening to my parents. I stopped listening to my mother. “Fuck my mother.” She’d ruin my life up till then. At least let me take over and ruin it on my own.\nI meant to say to my mother, “please pass the butter.” But it came out… well, you know how it came out…\nI didn’t want to be a Bachelor of Fine Arts.\nI walked over to a little “carriage” house that had the words “art studio” carved over its door. I walked in and as soon as I crossed the threshold I knew I was home. Hansel and Greta. It was a small two-story building just on the edge of the campus. I’m not sure anybody knew it was even there. It would be my home for the next two and half years.\nThe teacher who ran the place was George Mason. A big hairy guy dressed in white shirt and jeans and work boots. He had a flock of untamed black curly hair. He was starting to loose a little of it, around the temples. He had a big bushy mustache too. It covered half his mouth. He had a paunch that sagged over his belt. I’m not sure I can describe what I felt that first day but maybe feeling happy and good and some kind of love could begin to explain the experience.\nOpen sesame.\nGeorge did his schooling in Kansas. Kansas City Art Institute.\nGeorge would be my mentor and only “art” teacher. He would show me, guide me, tell me things about art… things that I would hear for the first time. I was raw, ignorant, and knew next to nothing about art history.\nAn open book.\nI wanted. I was ready. I was greedy.\nMy purpose, if you could call it that, was sealed.\nDelivered.\nI landed.\nThe promised land? Maybe. I didn’t care what you called it. I woke up. I got tapped on the shoulder… “hey buddy, yea you… this way”. I’d been submerged into the waters of a new religion. Baptized. Praise the Lord. Art saves.\n“When you wish upon a star.”\nNo, not from Disney’s Pinocchio…\nFrom the funky Shinning Star lyric by Earth Wind & Fire.\nI would become George’s star pupil.\nNo stoned unturned.\nLand Ho.\nGeorge dug my “god given” talent to draw. I had almost forgotten about it until those museum sketches I had started to do in Europe, when I was round robing and “Louving”. Spending afternoons in front of Rubens, Corot, Manet, Delacroix, Langetti, Giordana, Ingres, the weirdness of Henry Fuseli, and the really old… Pontormo. Endless halls, football fields of walls, hanging floor to ceiling, salons, forgotten fill, donations, gifts, the second rate, having to concentrate, graduate, getting away from the shellac and glaze and the boated frames, finding a room of Kees van Dongen, a room of Ensor, Alfred Stevens, Irving Wiles, an alcove with a single Sir William Orpen, trying to figure out the meat in the hip, the folds in the stomach, how to render the extra chub of a Thomas Eakins charcoal with a stick of conte crayon on Bristol. All I had to do was stare at Redon’s pastel “Nude with a Blue Scarf, circa 1900 and I knew everything was going to be okay. Sometimes I would divert, diversion, faint, switch to an object. Deciding Roman Imperial marble, 1st , 2nd century was keen. It was brilliant really. Pat myself. Surround. Carved. Dipping. Sometimes photo the marble and copy the shadows just like when Picasso went Rose. And just like that, another turn, a quick skip jump. The Gardner. Boston. Near the Fenway. Sargent’s ‘Sleeping Peter Harrison’… I would look at that and wonder… how in the world?\nWhat did I want? I wanted… encyclopedia.\nHand Jive.\nI showed George some sketch book pages of Cezanne’s “bathers” I had done in Paris. Copies I did at the Je Du Pomme. Showed him some thoughts on Degas and Vuillard. Muddy thoughts. Showed him a chalk head after Watteau I did at the National in London. Promises. It was all homework. Home school. George said, after he looked, “welcome to the club.” It wasn’t bombs bursting in air but it wasn’t hot air either.\nHe started me off with a table, a chair, and my own window. The first thing he said to me…” don’t waste time trying to be a “maestro.” “And don’t finish anything either”. He walked away and came back about ten minutes later and said, “And another thing…”\n“Experiment. Wrong turns, accidents, limitations, all good. Do things you can’t. Technique, style? There’s plenty of time.\"\nA primer.\n“You have no audience.\nNo one is watching you.\nYou can get away with anything.\nPretty much…\nThe important thing… you have no responsibilities.”\nNot bad for the first day.\nINITIATION.\nFar fucking out.\nThe other students felt right to me. There was something about their physicality that made sense and made me comfortable. They way they combed their hair. The clothes they had on. Belts cinched an extra notch. The cuffs of their pants above the ankle. Sleeveless dresses. An extra shirt tied at the waist. Hats that never came off, inside or out. The way they said hello. Lifted their eyes and blinked. Most of them behind glasses.\nBuddy Holly.\nI blended.\nIf I were falling in love you might call it “smitten.” I was falling in love.\nCross-eyed.\nWe worked in all kinds of mediums and subjects at the studio but the one that stood out the most was working with the figure.\nDrawing class. Twice a week.\nA model came to the studio, usually in the evening and we’d sit around and draw either him or her. Sometimes there were two figures. Him and her. And it wasn’t just students. Older, working artists came and joined. Coughed up the five or six dollars we’d each give to the model after it was over.\n“The kitty.”\nAfter drawing for two hours we’d show each other what we drew and talk about our drawings. Someone would bring beer. After a session it would turn into a private party. I couldn’t get enough of figure class. To draw the human form was foundation. Starting from scratch. George would say everything starts with drawing the figure. He would say this to anyone who would listen. “You can make any kind of art you want, but if you can’t draw the figure… if you don’t have that line…the scale and weight…you’ll never get any of the rest right”.\nAny of the rest.\nI believed it. And I liked the discipline. The promise of a man. I learned to switch hit. The ability to take a piece of paper and pencil and draw from life. Rock of ages. It was the thing that connected me to Plato’s cave. All the way back. Rock on rock.\nCollection.\nGod-Send.\nGiant luck.\nA big part of George was his house and the art that he had hanging in his house.\nThe house was a revelation.\nInspired. Vision. Truth. Supernatural. Filled with an inner voice and human knowledge. If that sounds biblical, (something not before realized)… all I can say… early days of rollicking and new living translation.\nPlain English?\nNo moral sermons.\nNo ethical ideas.\nTo go over and spend time in George’s house and see real art on the wall made me crazy. Faint of heart. Hiccup. Dizzy Dean. I felt like I was falling with angels. Cold sweat. The notes from some long forgotten cover of the Dells “Crystal Persuasion” kept clogging my ears. The palms of my hands, paper towels, drama. I was leaking all over the place. I don’t know else to describe it. I’d never been in a house with a real painting by a famous artist. I’m not even sure if I knew if it was possible.\nTake me to the pilot.\nA real Picasso etching? A watercolor by Matisse and lithographs by Kathe Kollwitz? Is that a Muybridge photograph? George Bellows. Milton Avery. John Marin. Fairfield Porter. A charcoal study by Charles Burchfield? On the fresh. It was the first time I was introduced to the painting of Walt Kuhn and Romaine Brooks. Crazy rabbit!\nCan I go to your bedroom?\nOne of George’s teachers was William Bailey. Bailey taught at Yale. But before that he taught in Kansas City, at the University. George had these beautiful figure drawings of Bailey’s. They were made with a 4-H pencil on hot press d’arche paper. The forms of the figures were delicately cross-hatched, a way of drawing that went back to Durer. They were exquisite, and I would, for a time, ape Bailey’s technique and replicate the centuries old style of preparation and study.\nGeorge’s library was filled with monographs. His favorite artists. Henri Laurens. Marisol. Giacometti. The American Impressionist Mary Cassatt. I’d go in, park and get lost. Americans, George Bellows and Reginald Marsh. Europeans, George Rouault and Jules Pascin. There were stacks. Overflow. Piled on the floor. On the window sill. I had always wanted to spend time in room like this. Sheltered. Away. Suspended. Leaving time alone. Unaccounted for. A fireplace and a waxy brown club chair you could comfortably curl up in and look and read in for a century. Howdy Doody Time!\nGeorge’s wife Stella was French Canadian. She was dark and soft, a stunner, and supportive of all things creative. She made pottery. She was George’s wife but she was also George’s muse. She was sensual, smart, sophisticated. They just had a second child, a boy, Ethan… and her breasts were huge from nursing. She was a dead ringer for Anna Magnani. She was behind George all the way. She was the gate-keeper of George’s world. She ran the house. She kept things in line. She use to say to me, “Listen to me. No drugs on my property. You smoke, drop, or inject… look for another house. See that sign over the door? Stay clear. Stay away. Stay out.”\nHer territory was clean.\nNo rabbit holes in her yard.\nPay attention.\n“You want to hang?\nAt my house?”\nInvitation. Privilege. Reward. Blessed.\nBefore I turned up their driveway and got out the car, I left any and all recreation in my glove compartment.\n77 Sunset Strip.\nThe Mason’s weren’t part of contemporary culture. They weren’t beatniks or hippies. They weren’t square, hip, they weren’t, sail on sailor. They listened to Burl Ives, Theodore Bikel, Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs. They gave each other haircuts. Wet clothes drying on a clothe’s line. (Clothes line saga). They had their own scene. Face down in the ocean. You couldn’t reach them with favors and pies. Alphabet anonymity. No screams. A line-up entirely devoid of headquarters. Alphabet-soup naming strategies. Underperformed.\nTheir interests and rules had nothing to do with what was going on in magazines, movies or TV. Friends, relatives, family… that’s where they were at. Art was what consumed them, what they lived for. Never played out. Spun away. Intimate. Cozy. C’mon. They would even listen. I certify that I’m 21 years of age. Club Adam rules. Recent letter and frank photo welcome. First name basis. Shit yea. Can I come in?\nTwinkle Twinkle Little Star.\nLights the traveller in the dark.\nBright and tiny sparks.\nI joined.\nThe Masons became my new family.\nIf it started anywhere, it started with the Masons in\nNorth Berwick Maine. 1969.\n10/23/2014\nJames Joyce Farts.\nI would like to thank Sylvia Beach, Nora Barnacle, Margaret Anderson, Jean Heap, Elsa Von Freytag-Loringhorven, and Harriet Shaw Weaver who made it possible for James Joyce's Ulysses to be published.\n10/21/2014\nLets clear something up. I don't LOVE breasts. I LIKE breasts. What I LOVE is pussy. I love pussy so much, if it was air-conditioned I'd live in it.\n10/17/2014\nIt’s a free concert.\nI can’t remember the girl’s name. She was big. Taller than me and solidly built. Like a Robert Crumb cartoon. She had extra long light brown hair that went down to the small of her back. She was beautiful. She looked like a hippie. She looked like what a hippie should look like. Poster girl for hippie girl.\nI was focused on trying to get her to like me and forgot about where we were going and what we were going for.\nWe hit traffic, twenty-five miles outside of the festival site. Four in the morning. Saugerties? I didn’t know where the fuck we were. The highway was suddenly filled with cars and all the cars seemed to be going to one place. Unbelievable. Crazy. Dead stop. It would take another ten hours to go the last twelve miles.\nWe finally turned off the highway and found ourselves in the middle of a forest filled with birch trees. It was at the end of someone’s field. We wanted the trip to end. We got out of the car and called it quits. As good a place as any. We weren’t alone.\nPasture, cows, a pond, and a sea of green.\nWe settled in.\nWe had brought a tent and sleeping bags. I’m not sure why we brought it, but thank god for the tent. It was Friday afternoon. It started raining and would continue to rain off and on all weekend. After we pitched the tent we took a nap. This was our first time together. It was awkward. We didn’t know each other. Hadn’t even gone to a movie. We were supposed to hook up with friends and expected the company to take some of the absence of not knowing who we were away. We fooled around. We fumbled with each other. We acted like we were being secretly chaperoned.\nWe tried. We stopped. We were tired. We had plenty of time. We had two and half days to go. We shared a tab of acid and went looking for the concert.\nSantana.\nWe were a ten minute walk away from the back of the stage. There was chain link fence that had been trampled and laying on the ground. It had been put there to mark what was in and what was out. Now it was on the ground. There was no in or out. There was nothing. No entrance, no one taking tickets. We stepped over the fence and we were in. In what? I noticed hundreds of tickets on the ground. No pushing. No shoving. No waiting. Welcome to the garden.\nFor some reason I didn’t throw my ticket down on the ground. I kept it. I’m not sure why. Memorabilia? Who knows? Proof? I was years away from that kind of collecting. I put the stub in my wallet and kept walking. We were about to enter a field of revolution. We had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. We walked past the stage and started to go up an incline that was shaped like half a megaphone. The higher we climbed the wider the phone. The bowl was sculpture. A half-pipe. Liftoff. When we got to the top of the sculpture we were about a quarter mile away from the stage. Everywhere you looked there were people. It wasn’t like the people were an audience. It was more like they were pilgrims. Tribes. “As far as the eye could see.” So many people. For one thing. The same purpose. The half tab of acid started to kick in. It was six o’clock. Friday evening. Everything started to feel free.\nTremendous.\nRichie Havens was playing. He kept walking off stage and returning. It wasn’t like an encore… he just kept coming and going singing “Freedom”. Strumming. Furiously. His left thumb pressed down on the strings, chording his open tuning. I think he was freaked out about the sheer size of the crowd. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing. I heard later whoever was suppose to go on second wasn’t ready, so the promoters kept telling him to keep it up. “Don’t let the song go.”\n#36#36#36\nAround seven-thirty that evening I took the only photograph that I would take all weekend. I had borrowed my mother’s camera and there was only one exposure left on a roll of color slide film. THE LAST EXPOSURE. Number thirty-six. I figured I could buy film in town after I arrived. It hadn’t occurred to me that once I got to the concert they’d be no way to leave. It had taken so long to get there, I wasn’t going to try to find a near-by town with a store… maybe… and risk never getting back. Not worth it. The acid in my head was telling me to get back to the top of the slide.\nSo this is a rock concert.\nWe had no idea.\nI once went to a folk festival in Rhode Island. (Light years away). The “no idea” would continue for the next couple of days but I think we figured out pretty quickly we hit the mother lode.\nThe definition of \"motherlode\"... an alignment of hard-rock.\nHaving one exposure left in my mother’s camera was going to drive me crazy. For the rest of the weekend I was going try to take the perfect picture. And what if I couldn’t? What if I wasted it? Good one, bad one. Did I even want to try? What if I saved it and waited till the weekend was over? I told myself there would be no great fantastic out of this world moment. No gold rush. No yellow fever. I decided to let it go. The sun had just gone down and some lights on the scaffolding near the stage had come on. I remembered what Bob Rauschenberg had once told an interviewer about being in a room of abstract paintings by Ad Reinhardt, and after being asked which one he liked… he spun himself around and stopped and randomly pointed to one after he stopped… and said, “that one.”\nSo that’s what I did.\nI stood up and started spinning. Like a dervish. I whirled around and stopped and clicked. I wouldn’t see what I took for another couple of weeks. My mother took the roll of film to the drugstore and when the slides came back she gave me the chrome. I put the chrome in the slide projector and took a look. In those days the slides were squares. What was projected was an image of girl standing in what appeared to be an “artist’s pose.” There was a sea of bodies around her. The lights on the scaffolding were in the distance. If you looked closely there was a run-a-way balloon in the sky. It was all there. All that I hoped for. And all I needed. Summation. Without thinking, without effort, without craft and knowing what I was doing, I took my one and only photograph of Woodstock. I got lucky.\nLike the saved ticket, I put the slide away for “safe keeping” in my wallet.\nIt stayed there for the next fifteen years.\nThe big girl and I goofed off a lot. We stayed in our tent and went swimming in a pond and ate the sandwiches my mother gave us just before we took off. I’m not even sure if we went back the concert on Saturday. It rained all day. We missed Sly And The Family Stone. We missed The Who and Crosby Stills and Nash. We might of spent part of Saturday at the concert but I can’t remember. We saw Santana. A group we were both unaware of. But that might have been Friday night. We saw Alvin Lee and Ten Years After. We probably saw them on Saturday but I can’t be certain. Saturday was a blur. I know we spent part of the day looking for my car. And I know we shared some mushrooms with another couple who were camping next to us. To tell you the truth, I don’t think we ever thought about being in a place or being part of an experience that later, would come to define a generation.\nSunday cleared up.\nThe clouds broke and sun came out. The afternoon was warm and everything wet, didn’t matter. All our clothes were soaked, and our feet were caked with mud. But the feeling of the sun finally hitting us felt wonderfully warm. The warm started to dry and clear our heads and we finally relaxed and enjoyed what was happening around us. Sex with the Big Girl finally happened that morning. We’d been naked, skinny dipping in the pond, but being naked, next to her, holding her, and lying up against her flesh this way, was better than splashing and swimming.\nWay better.\nExciting.\nTo say the least.\nWavy Gravy.\nWe could hear Country Joe And the Fish coming in from over the fields. IN COMING. \"And it's one two three four what are we fighting for? Don’t ask me I don't give a damn. Next stop is Vietnam. Whopee we're all gonna die\".\nWe put our clothes on and made it just in time for Joe Cocker. “With a little help from my friends.” Joe Cocker and the Grease Band. Knocked our socks off. Loved his body spazzing out. Having a fit. Epileptic. The guy could belt it out.\nThis was around twelve one o’clock. I remember the time. Just before Cocker went on, one of the stage managers read from the front page of the N.Y. Times. The headline: “A small city has suddenly formed in the middle of upstate New York. A small peaceful city.”\nAfter Joe, it was time to go…\nWe had to leave. I promised my boss I’d be back by Sunday. We were clear of the festival and out on 87 south, around three. We’d be back on the Cape around ten. Normal Sunday traffic.\nPurple Haze\nWe never got to see Jimi Hendrix. That’s why I went. To see Jimi. That’s why I bought the tickets in the first place. It was all for him. Another thing we didn’t see were our friends. Never found them. We thought we’d just meet up… rendezvous. See you in the parking lot. (Lots of luck). Never expected a migration. A nomadic movement. A pilgrimage.\nWe heard later, Hendrix played Monday morning. Woke the crowd up with the star-spangle banner. Guess the people who stayed didn’t make any promises.\nI would see and hear Hendrix play “the banner” a year later when the film came out. With the rest of the population.\nTimes didn’t change just because the song said they had.\nI never saw the Big Girl again.\nAfter I dropped her off, I heard her father wanted my head on a platter. I’d assumed she asked her parents permission to go, but I was wrong. She didn’t tell them anything. Where she was going. Who she was going with. Not a word. I think her Dad thought the worst. APB. “All Points Bulletin.” I can’t blame him for wanting me locked up.\nWe were strangers.\nIt was our first date.\nWe went way out.\nWe got to see what never had been seen.\nFiguring out new figures.\nI once went out on a date with the girl who played Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks. She could have been anyone to me.\nTell me more.\nIn 2004 I made an edition of my Woodstock photograph for Parkett Magazine. And this past winter I ink jetted the cover of a Woodstock “brochure” that was illustrated with a field of daisy’s and the words that we had all gone for… “3 days of peace & music.” I jetted the brochure in six parts, separating each part so each part got one word of the title. I showed the painting in Bregenz this past summer. The show was work that had been done in the last six years. The show was called “It’s A Free Concert.” The edition and six-part painting focused my attention on my own history. Things that I was involved with personally, either as a participant, or as a witness. Up till then, I always presented my history as if I’d had none. I would tell a story, that even though the story was true, it sounded like it wasn’t. It didn’t matter if you believed me or not. True or false? Not important. What was? Being asked. Because in the end I can’t tell you anything.\nWhat was it Mr. Jimi once said?\n“Now if you’ll excuse me, I must be on my way….”\nBIRDTALK\n10/9/2014\nSurf and Turf.\nWhile playing golf today, I hit two good balls. I stepped on a rake.\n“You got to be kidding me?\nYou what?\nYou play fucking golf?\nFor Christ sake… you’re not serious…\nWhat are you, a fucking dweeb?\nI thought only fucking shitheads and wasps played golf.\nFucking Republican assholes…”\nAnd that’s just from my wife!\nThe last thing an artist should do (or admit to) is that they play golf.\nThe game has always been associated with white shoes, white belts, white people.\nIt certainly isn’t hip, fashionable, or totally “rad,” like surfing.\nSurfing and art.\nBosom buddies.\nHand In Hand.\nNo apologies.\nPosers and wannabes… step into the liquid.\nI’m the Dude.\nTennis? I don’t know anything about tennis.\nPoker? More than okay.\nPick-up basketball? Check.\nPlaying the ponies? Perfect.\nPool or billiards? Up there with surfing.\nBoxing? I don’t know any artists who box, but if they do, it could only elevate and help tell their story.\nEven bowling has slacker cred, now that “The Big Lebowski” has it’s own convention and legions of fans wearing pajamas and hairnets.\nHey Zeus.\nSpoiling the mood.\nBut golf …\nWho the fuck plays golf?\nI don’t think Richard Serra is bending a sand iron or shaping a 56-degree wedge out of a hazard.\nThat would be something though, wouldn’t it?\nRichard cold-cocking a five hybrid from 215 into the wind for a tap-in greenie?\nCozy.\nSo here’s the deal.\nIf you’ve ever seen Jimmy Caan in “The Gambler” you’ll know what I mean…\nGolf is about money. (And I don’t mean how much it costs to play.)\nGolf is handicapped and one of the only “games” that’s specifically “made-up” to bet on.\nWhen you play golf you wager and try to beat the pants off your opponent and get as much out of his or her wallet as you can take.\nThat’s it. That’s what makes golf different. That’s what makes golf good. That’s what makes it a hacker’s dream.\nBet the farm.\nSandbag.\nSandbagging…\nDefinition? In a word? Deception.\nDeliberately playing below one’s actual ability in order to fool an opponent into accepting higher stakes and consequently have a better chance of winning more money.\nI can play the best golfer in the world and “get strokes” and still have a chance…\nHeads up.\nMatch Play.\nYou play eighteen holes and whoever wins the most holes, wins the match.\nI can play a duffer. I can play a pro.\nTriple A? No. You don’t need a rating. You need a handicap.\nYou got a handicap, your good to go.\nI might loose a couple of holes, but in the end, I’ll win the rest. I’ll be dormie with one hole to play and come to the 18th needing only to tie to win.\nCount on it.\nHave I lost you yet?\nTwo from Cool Hand Luke:\n“What we have here is a failure to communicate.”\n“Bubba Lou, we got a bet here.”\nA friendly wager.\nThe way it works is simple.\nSay if I play John Daley… I’ll ask him for twenty strokes. Each of the eighteen holes on any course is rated in terms of difficulty. If I’m getting a stroke on the first hole and I par the hole and Daley pars the hole, I win because he’s giving me a stroke. (My four turns into a net three and his four stays a four, and I’m off to the races.)\nIf none of this translates, don’t worry. Trust me. Everybody who plays golf… bets.\nThe Party Line.\n“Sunny Side Up.”\nThat’s the image.\nSponsored by Cadillac.\nBrought to you by Met Life and Snoopy II.\nGoody Two Shoes.\nThe Colgate Smile.\nDopey Bermuda shorts. And alligator shirts.\nThat’s the tale.\nAnd then there’s the flip.\nThe other side of the coin.\nFor “heads,” its drugs, juice (narcotics) and prescription pain killers.\nWhat did you think? It’s a professional sport. Injuries. The club head speed alone. Rips your back apart. “Squeaky Clean”… a concoction of oxy and hydromorphone helps get you to the first tee. Like any other sport… there’s a shelf life.\nThe Slits.\nOr is it Patsy Kline singing “Crazy?”\nI would love to go to the Dinah Shore Invitational. Palms Spring Desert. It’s a same-sex “sex fest.” Bring along Natalie Barney, Djuna Barnes, and Renee Vivien. Get Romaine Brooks to do Dinah’s portrait.\nSide bets.\nOn any given weekend, there are only twenty pros in the mix. Those who barely made the cut are betting their ass’s off after they’ve fallen off the leader board and have no chance of finishing in the top ten.\n“Bad day at the course,” a guy tells his wife. “Charlie had a heart attack on the third hole.” “That’s terrible!” says the wife. “You’re telling me,” the husband replies. “All day long, it was, hit the ball, drag Charlie.”\nJohn Daley sells t-shirts across the street from the Masters when he can’t qualify for the green jacket. That morning he played a sucker with only a seven iron in his bag. Played the entire 18 with only one club. Capture the flag. A hustle he learned from Lee Trevino, “The Merry Mex,” a hall of famer, who grew up with peanuts and honed his game on public links and parking lots. Trevino was like a card shark that trolls for whales in Atlantic City. Back to back British Open titles. Once played an entire round with an iron turned around. Hit the ball with the BACK of his club. What can I say? Over easy.\n“You can make a lot of money playing golf. Just ask my ex-wives. Both of them are so rich, neither of their husbands work.”\nI’ve known semi-pros who don’t have the game for the PGA tour, don’t give a shit about trophies and “first place” and make a pretty good living choking down on a five iron and stealing the socks off of hot shot Sunday golf addicts, luring and landing them with five a side…\nBread And Butter.\nI’ve known caddies who agree to putt with their drivers, and milk the Benjamin’s out of their members who they’re suppose to be caddying for.\n“I’d give up golf if I didn’t have so many sweaters.” Bob Hope\nWill golf ever be cool?\nAsk my wife… please…\nOr ask Iggy Pop.\nPlayed all his life.\nPop is a “scratch” player.\nScratch meaning, he shoots par.\nScratch meaning his handicap is zero.\nScratch meaning he can get up and down nine times out of ten from a greenside bunker.\nScratch meaning he can worm burn a three iron, keeping it under the wind, adding another twenty yards to the carry.\nScratch meaning he carries a heaven wood to carve up a dogleg left, eliminating a good fifty yards from tee to green.\nScratch meaning, he wants you to be his dog.\nWhy I Go To The Movies Alone should answer the question.\nWhen I was fifteen I got into some trouble and a judge and my parents decided, rather then reform, they would send me to caddy camp.\nFucking caddy camp.\nTrue story.\nThis was back in 1964.\nSummer.\nMy parents let me off at the Hyannis Port Golf club in late June and didn’t pick me up until after Labor Day.\nInterned.\nI had no idea what I was in for.\nI’m not sure if they have caddie camps anymore but back in the sixties it was a place for teenage boys who were…\nONE: In trouble with the law, nothing serious… minor offences… shoplifting, stealing a car, joyriding.\nTWO: Kids who really wanted to play golf, so when they weren’t caddying they would play after all the members left for the day, in the evening, when the course was empty.\nTHREE: Mentally unstable idiots who didn’t fit in, were social outcasts, picked on, withdrawn, loners, listened to The Fugs and couldn’t wait to hit sixteen so they could drop out, tune in, and turn on.\nI was in the first category. Minor Mishap. I didn’t know my ass from my elbow…\nI didn’t know that I would be living in a tent with seven other boys somewhere out in the back nine, in an area that was hidden from the fairways and greens, that looked like the “set” in the TV show Mash.\nBivouac.\nPlatoon.\nThere were five other tents, eight kids to a tent, a mess hall, a rec room, a small courtyard anchored with a flag pole surrounded by small rocks and one more tent where the “councilors” lived.\nThe best way to describe the living conditions, the “environment” at the caddie camp?\nLord of The Flies.\nI won’t go into details, but you can imagine what happens when eight teenage boys, who have never met, are suddenly thrown together into 75 square feet, (tented together with canvas and floorboards), and are immediately hammered by military style rules and regulations, lectured and drilled, like we we’re plebes or private recruits who were just drafted into an army that we wanted no part of.\nHeart Of Darkness?\nClose.\nSave the last dance.\nOne of the first things we were required to do was make sure our “quarters” were shipshape. Beds perfectly made. Contents of our lockers stored and neatly organized. Latrines spotless. Once a week everyone pulled latrine duty. You had to be gang masked to survive the smell, the stench, the waft, the ass wipe, the paper trail. Dip-shit potty training.\nBattle of the bands.\nThe first night there was a group grope, and we circled jerked and saved all our jizz, about a half a cup’s worth… went out to the 15th hole in the middle of the night, removed the flag and poured the contents of the cup into the bottom of the “tin cup.”\nEat-A-Bit-Of-Pie.\nSome kind of half-ass fraternity pledge.\nThe next day, the first golfer to drain his putt on 15 was in for a sticky surprise.\nThe morning after, we were awakened at six, (revelry) and told to assemble, shoulder to shoulder.\nOld glory was run up the pole and after a lazy salute, were informed by “the general”… this broken down old fat face man, “head honcho,” the wheeler dealer who ran the camp… that every one of us had to make twenty dollars a week to pay for room and board. Twenty Dollars!\nTwenty doesn’t sound much today, but back in ‘64, to a teenager, it’s a windfall.\nFast Food Franchise.\nTurns out “the fat face general,” ran several of these camps on Cape Cod. All the “tony” courses had them. From Dennisport to Truro. Carpetbagger.\nHe was cozy with Joe Kennedy.\nThe Presidents father.\nJoe was a bootlegger back in the day. Ran rum up and down “the cod.”\nProhibition.\nKickback.\nUnder the table.\nAll cash.\nThe fat face general and Irish Joe.\nTakes one to know one.\nAside from the kids who there to jump start their golf skills, and saw the summer season as an “opportunity,” the majority of us didn’t know “From Adam” about the game. And even less how to carry a bag of golf clubs and tell its owner… “ah… its playing 135 into the wind… I think it’s a hard eight or a soft nine.”\nShit from Shinola.\nBut I’m a fast learner when it comes to making money.\nThe Hyannis Port Golf Club was part of the Kennedy compound. The course was private and gated and guarded. This was right after President Kennedy was killed and his brother Bobby and Teddy and his widow Jackie were staying off and on in a gigantic Cape Cod mansion along with their broods and guests. Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow were lovey-dovey on a yacht anchored just off shore. Frank and Mia were having a “torrid” affair until Mia cut off all her hair to play the lead in Roman Polanski’s, “Rosemary’s Baby.” Frank dumped her after getting a look at her new bob, remarking to one of his cronies… “She looks like a little boy.”\nNo crossing the chairman of the board, even if he does wear a toupee.\nI didn’t know I was in the middle of the aftermath of Camelot.\nThe fist thing I did was saddle up to the caddie master. He was the guy who assigned the loops. A loop is eighteen holes. You start out carrying one bag, but after a week if you can deal with the weight and strain and the lost balls… you graduate to two bags… one on each shoulder, doubling your “take” and “tips” at the end of each round.\nExercise.\nI got up to speed pretty fast.\nI kicked back some of my earnings to the “master” to get the premium “loops.”\nGraft and payoffs were part of life lessons.\nPart and parcel.\nOn the dot.\nThe best loop went out every Saturday morning at 6:45.\nIt was called the Blue Boy loop.\nOne of the guys in the loop dressed in blue. Powdered blue. The outfit was fly. The guy had style. Tapered pants. Fitted shirt. Custom shoes. No hat. Thin gold chain around his neck. He a lot of blonde “waxen” hair piled high on his head. He never said a word. Later I would learn the guy they called Blue Boy, turned out to be Rutger Hauer and would eventually star in the movie “Blade Runner.”\nI caddied for all four in the foursome.\nBlue Boy and his partner walked.\nI carried their bags.\nThe other two in the group took a cart.\nTwo bags in the cart. I had to make sure the two in the cart were clubbed too.\nThe only reason why you could caddie for a foursome, alone, was… they were “straight shooters.” Center cut. Right down middle. (You didn’t need a second, a backup, a scout). They’re combined handicaps? Five. Never any slices, hooks or shanks. Never had to waste time and find a ball. If anything, first cut of the rough. Pars and birdies were the norm. They were fast. Under four hours for the round. I was back at the clubhouse by late morning. Meaning? I could go back out for a second loop. (More money). The Blue Boy loop netted me seven dollars times four plus an extra fiver from each of the “boys.” A gratuity. Again, not much these days, but back then… a score, a payday.\nCrystal Clear.\nA couple of things I remember about being inside the moat.\nONE: Caddying for Jackie Kennedy.\nShe seemed to be depressed and never got past the seventh hole. She wasn’t into it. She was going thru the moves. Killing time. She always went out alone. I’m not even sure her bag had more than six clubs in it. She was like Blue Boy. Never said a word. Her expression never changed. Frozen. She was somewhere else. She didn’t carry money, so her round would be settled in the pro shop. She’d be long gone by the time I got to the cashier.\nTWO: Caddying for Frank Malzone. Third baseman for the Boston Red Sox.\nTHREE: Giving candy to John John Kennedy and his sister Caroline who weren’t even kids yet. They were always hanging around the clubhouse. Built-in babysitting. There was always some secret service dude hanging around, keeping an eye on them, talking into his lapel.\nFOUR: Getting back from carrying bags all day… walking about a mile back from the “caddie shack” to the mess hall and getting there way to late for “last call.” Finding out that there was only “the dregs” left… a little soup, some bread. Left overs really sucked. I was seriously hungry all summer.\nFIVE: Offering up my seventeen year old sister to the Caddie Master who happened to know her and her reputation and wanted to fuck her and would I somehow put in a good word. “Of course,” I said. “I’ll see what I can do”.\nAnd then…\n“What do can you do for me?”\nMe a pimp?\nYou think?\nSIX: Nicking the occasional five iron and trying to find balls in the bushes or taking a few right out of the bag. Finders Keepers. Forking over “the keep” to a councilor for sixty cents on the dollar.\nAll the councilors were prepping for college golf. They were all eighteen, had been coming to the camp for four, sometimes five summers straight. Stepping stones. A bunch of jar heads. It was like they’d already joined special forces. Who Rah!\nSEVEN: Watching some of the younger caddies get “pink bellies.” Holding them down, slapping their bare mid-rifts with the palm of your hand, then pouring after-shave over the stomach. Ouch. A ritual. A hazing. Medieval mindless macho crap. Nothing to do? Let’s wail on a pipsqueak. Pick on someone your own size? Not a chance. I thought it was sadistic first time I saw it. Walked away. No truck. What I say? Morons and mental cases.\n“I have the fire.”\nAt the end of the summer I saved a little over two hundred dollars. I spent one hundred and sixty of that on a big-ass Harmony Sovereign acoustic guitar. Chimes of freedom flashing. I was a little behind the times. Found out Dylan had just gone electric at Newport.\nJeff Spicoli.\nIn 2005, Fast Times at Ridgemont High was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being… “culturally, historically, aesthetically, significant.”\nSo I know all you “grommets” are stoked and riding two-foot swells out in Far Rockaway. Trying to be all “Point Break.” Soaking your tats for ten second rides. Brave-away. Kicking back at Surf Lodge. Long boarding out at Ditch in the middle of Hurricane Irene. (Good night Irene.) I get it. I got no beef. Just messing with you. Raspberry.\nJust so you know…\nI know the waves are free.\nI spent a summer out in Hawaii just before graduating high school surfing three footers in front of ugly Waikiki hotels. The waves went on forever. You could read a short story by the time funnel collapsed. I avoided the North Shore after my Dad, who was stationed in Honolulu, (going back and forth to Vietnam), almost drowned from body surfing. His head was in a jar too.\nThe pipeline on the north shore is massive, sometimes crumbly, and after it hits the first reef, the swell turns into a racetrack. Getting spit out of the barrel is a thrill of a lifetime. How do I know this? I don’t. And neither do you.\nWipe Out.\nI appreciate the athleticism. I dig the culture. I’m jealous about the chicks. I like getting wet. And I KNOW… I know it’s super cool and something you can do alone and travel all over the world and look for the perfect wave. It’s a charged lifestyle. Transformative. Living in the now. The moods and motions of the ocean. “Equal before the wave.”\nIf in doubt, paddle out.\nI see all the boards bungeed to the top of cars, the drivers scoping for sandbars and watching for breaks at the end of Town Line Rd., in Wainscott, twenty seconds from my crib out on Long Island. But for the life of me, I don’t see what they’re looking for.\nSurfs Up?\nThe sunset is pretty but the waves are soda stream. Chop Suey.\nI cry when the angels deserve to die.\nThe only artist I know who surfs is Ashley Bickerton and he’s half way around the world tubing ten footers in Bali-Hi.\nSo what’s up with me loading on about this golf shit?\nCrabgrass.\nRight?\nI met the guy who used to own the Bridgehampton Race Track in Bridgehampton Long Island.\nHis name is Bob Rubin.\nThe track that he owned was famous. It went back to the early fifties and all the great race drivers raced there. From rallies to formula one. From Mario Andretti to Paul Newman. The trouble was… sound. Sound from the cars. On a Sunday afternoon you could hear the cars shifting gears ten miles away. Depending on the wind… twenty.\nThe track was located on 450 acres in the middle of nowhere for four decades. But local builders ran out of room and started building spec houses near the track. The track is off of Scuttle Hole Rd… pretty close to Noyac and sits on one of the highest pieces of land in Long Island. In the early nineties the town started to give Bob shit about the “environmental impact” his races were having on the surrounding homeowners newly bought property.\n“A peaceful easy feeling.”\nThe town officials didn’t put it in those terms, but they did say to Bob, “turn it down.”\nWakeup call!\nTwo Headlines.\n“Gas Guzzling Flamethrowers.\nDemolition Derby devils Church Day.”\nThat’s my guess.\nSome unsuspecting weekend vacationer bought a house on a Tuesday, during the middle of winter and didn’t move in until June, woke up on his first Sunday, (out in paradise), to the blasting deafening sounds of four hundred and twenty horses of hemi roaring down the straight away, baffling and belching and backfiring. The new homeowner freaks, flips. “NASCAR! IN MY BACKYARD!”\nVaroom!\nSunday donuts?\nThe only donuts on this guy’s Sunday were the ones left behind from peeling rubber coming off of 24” slicks.\n“Welcome to the neighborhood.”\nLong story short.\nThe new nesters complain.\nFile noise complaints.\nHire lawyers.\nConvince the town of Bridgehampton to shut the track down. Bob’s dream is shut down by 1995.\nWhat to do with 450 acres?\nRecreation.\nThere’s only a pitch and putt and a driving range on Rt.27 in Sagaponack called Poxabogue.\nSo… 450 acres…\n“What do I do with 450 acres?”\n“Hey I know… how about a brand new golf course?”\nLandlocked.\nBob knows shit about golf. Never played it. Never watched it. Doesn’t know the difference between a divot and the yips. Decides to travel for the next two years. Checks out all the great courses around the world. Comes back. Takes some lessons and starts some serious earth moving. End result… The Bridge.\nIf you can find it…\nThere’s a tiny checkered flag… the logo of the club… that serves as the sign, the way in… THIS IS THE PLACE.\nDeath Valley.\nUpon entering, you might think you’ve driven into Zabriskie Point, or maybe even the Australian outback where they filmed Mad Max. The terrain is bleak. Dessert. Scrub. If you didn’t go another half a mile you’d probably think you were tempting the outer boundaries in Planet Of The Apes. You might even turn around and look for another driveway.\nBob keeps remnants of the old racetrack. The famous Chevron Bridge is still there. There are tires everywhere. Some buried into the sod, half in half out. There are flagging stations peaking out of the woods. There’s rusting guardrails that use to keep racers from spinning out of control and crashing into the trunk of a tree. There are hunks of blacktop, piled into small pyramids of tar, channeling earthworks by Smithson and Heizer. Memories of Wilson and Taylor and Laurie Bird enter the picture. The ’55 Chevy and “the goat” make an appearance. All things being equal, the road that was, precludes conversation.\nTwo-Lane Blacktop.\nAnd then there’s the golf course.\nThe rural and the widescreen.\nVanishing Point Part Two.\nThe extended existential vision version.\nI know, a mouthful…\nAnother mouthful…\nA perfectly rolled joint.\nBig. Blunt. And imported.\nThe first fairway you see is the eighteenth.\nJell-O. Cool Whip. Marshmallow. And The Doors.\nIt’s just plain strange.\nThe contrast is unexpected. Large patches of dirt and stone, sand dunes and fescue… then suddenly, a manicured monster of abstract green. Arp. Calder. Joan Miro. The natural and the man-made collide. It reminds me when I’m walking down 5thAve. and see the Guggenheim peek out from all the day to day neighboring buildings. Where did it come from? How did it get here?\nLike a new landscape.\nThe Bridge is social science fiction.\nElevation at The Bridge.\nThe views…\nShelter Island.\nThe North Fork.\nSag Harbor.\nAs far as the eye can see.\nEven the byrds are high.\nI can see for miles.\nThe first clubhouse was a functional, beautiful, dump. The shape and its material, like one of those metal containers stacked up in a shipyard waiting to be craned onto a ship.\nIt was set next to what use to be the straight-a-way, right where the racers would pull in to make a pit stop. It wasn’t exactly \"gone with the wind\". The locker room was empty milk crates. Bare bones. Eventually it would be carted away and replaced by steel and glass. Modernity. A Roger Ferris design. The Bridge would be the first golf course in America with a flaming clubhouse.\nI can’t remember where or how I met Bob.\nTurned out his place was right around the corner from mine.\nHe was introduced to me as a book collector, art collector, and teacher of architecture up at Columbia University.\n“Did I mention I own a golf club?”\nThat’s how it started.\nAbout seven years ago.\nI had a set of clubs I bought at K-Mart. Use to take the kids to the driving range at Poxabogue.\nBob said why not stop by… bring the family… bring the clubs…\n“But I don’t have any golfs clothes”\n“No worries. Wear what you like. There’s no dress code.”\nBob was an amateur racecar driver. Drove the hell out of vintage Jaguars. Drove them around the bend in a leather helmet. I liked the fact that a guy who had no history or interest in the game, would make golf his next sport.\nBob owns the place.\nLock, stock and barrel.\nTurned it inside out and spray painted the words “breathtaking” onto an old car wreak left behind from \"race days\" at the halfway house when he was told to fuck off and close down the track.\nHis new super highway.\nSuper chill.\nBob filled the clubhouse with his art collection.\nHe hired a Scandinavian cook.\nHe has barbecue nights on Sunday and invites what’s left of Captain Beefheart’s band to play music that’s as different as the patio it’s playing on.\nHe invites the best Mexican food trucks from NYC and has them drive out on the L.I.E. and parks them next to the Captain’s patio jam.\nMm Mm Good.\nIt’s like warm milky tea.\nYou either put the ball in the hole or you don’t.\nNo umpire, no judge, no photo finish.\nNO FAVORITISM.\nNo subjectivity.\nNo speculation.\nGuess work?\nGuess what?\nThere is none.\nHonest Abe.\nThere’s enough rules in the game to fill a farmer’s almanac. Standards and practice. Every angle, every likelihood, every nook and cranny… covered. Etiquette alone fills up five chapters. Coast to coast. It takes awhile to get the hang, but the main thing is… it’s up to you.\nYou the player.\nYou’re the steward. The keeper. The final word.\nGamesmanship.\nIf your ball moves after you’ve “ground” your club and you don’t call a penalty on yourself… you’re a cheater. If you don’t add a stroke to your score, stick to priests and confession. Or, like Nick Carraway says of Jordan Baker, the golf champion in the Great Gatsby, “she was incurably dishonest.”\nTake the cure.\nMeditation.\nWhen you turn into a golf course, the rest of the world goes away. You leave everything behind. Is it safe? Yes. It’s safe. It all disappears.\nThe world you leave behind stays away for an afternoon. Temporarily.\nA good thing?\nYea… a pretty good thing.\nA breather.\nExhale.\nRest.\nYou have the honor.\nIt’s your tee.\nYou see the ball. You see where the ball goes before it goes. And you try to hit the ball without ever feeling like you hit it. It’s about as close to Zen as your going to get.\nMY GRASSHOPPER.\nOm on…\nSo that’s what I started doing.\nPlaying.\nI went over to the Bridge, alone, and started to play the back nine, late in the afternoon, taking in the silence and the crazy fucked up feeling of hitting a little white ball… flushing it with a three wood from two hundred and ten yards out… somehow connecting with a dimpled Top Flight from the middle of the fairway and two putting a twenty footer for par.\nAnd why?\nYou tell me.\nNo I’ll tell you.\nThe Beach Boys.\nI heard they never surfed.\n10/1/2014\nWhat do Picasso, Duchamp, Truman Capote, Lee Miller, Joan Didion, Pollack, Warhol, Kerouac, Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, Lee Krasner, Ed Sanders, Jack Smith, Peggy Guggenheim, Wallace Berman, Mercedes Matter, Virginia Wolf, Man Ray... have in common?\nThey all have a story.\n9/29/2014\nCold War\nI started to take photographs of places I was visiting.\nVisiting.\nWell not exactly visiting.\nI was nineteen and I was in Europe for the first time. September. 1968. Going to school at the University of Caen, in France. Part of a humanities program that was underwritten by the college I was going to, back in the states. It was my first time in Europe.\nI was going to college to avoid the draft.\nStudent deferment.\nAt the end of my senior year, 1971, my lottery number came up low, (156 out of a thousand), and I got drafted...\nBut that’s another story.\nI couldn’t hack the program at the University of Caen, had a hard time “sprecking” the French… didn’t get along with my professors, and didn’t see the value of studying dead sea “tapestries” filled with historical battles, crusades and dragons. Wall rugs. The lessons felt like… Surfin Safari. Trophy rights. Like we were plodding thru the Amazon, looking for dragons to hunt down and bag, and stuff over giant roaring fireplaces.\nBored...\nTears...\nSo I split.\nFor Paris.\nI hung out with a girl I had met on the boat coming over.\nFran. F.\nFrom UNV.\nTwo years older.\nExperienced.\nMy first real affair with the opposite sex.\nI felt like she was doing me a favor. Sorry for me. I didn’t know how else to react to her affection. I couldn’t accept the attraction. Mutual? One-sided? I didn’t know. Hard to read. Head. In. Clouds. At least that's how I felt. I was basing my behavior on cartoons and centerfolds. I was a mess and I was happy. Two sensations. At the same time. I was having a blast having sex everyday. Finally. It’s hard to put into words.\nWord.\nI couldn’t believe I was getting laid.\nWhen it stopped, I bought a Eurail Pass and started traveling all over Europe for four weeks.\nWhen I was in Paris I picked up some slides of “castles” that were for sale in the postcard racks outside of a “Tabac” store. There were more than just castles you could buy, but that’s what I bought first. The slides were organized by subject and came six slides in a sheet. They were housed in plastic sleeves. When I held them up to the light and looked at them, they were full of no nonsense information. They did their job. They gave you a view of whatever it was needed viewing. They were generic, professional. They added up. They especially added up if you didn’t know how to use a camera... or, wanted to bring back some sites you wouldn’t ordinarily have a chance to photograph if you did take photographs.\nDoes that make any sense?\nI wanted to make photographs just like the castles in the plastic sleeves. I wanted my photographs to be good as “theirs.”\nThis was the start of my wanting something that someone else was “already” doing.\nI took a trip to the Loire valley. I would find a castle and spend all afternoon walking around it to get the right shot. The best shot. The one and only.\nI was careful to take at least two. Two clicks of the camera. It was a matter of economics. The slide film in my camera cost money. I was on a strict budget. I spent my time looking thru the camera… a lot of time, before I made the exposure. I would spend an afternoon waiting for the right cloud cover. The right amount of light to make the castle come alive. I would spend hours walking around the castle making sure to find the exact location to make the castle important. To make the castle last. I wanted to promise the castle I would make it special. I wanted a magic castle.\nMy intention, my “desire”, my only concern, was to have the castle I was visiting, look… just like the castles in the slides that I bought outside the Tabac store. That’s all I wanted. Make them look as if I didn’t make them. Or even better, couldn’t make them.\nTo good to be true.\nAuthor’s responsibility?\nI didn’t have any.\nCould have cared less.\nI didn’t care about what I wanted. I cared about what they wanted. And I didn’t care who “they” were.\nIn the four weeks I spent in Europe “training” around the continent, I acted like I was on assignment. Acted. It was all made up. Whatever came out looked as if it was done by someone else.\nNot mine.\nIn the end I broke down my “assignment” to five groups of “views”. I photographed Castles, Canals, Public Sculpture… views from rooftops, and the Berlin Wall.\nMeager finances.\nStill I pushed it.\nI tried to get at least six or seven photographs of each category.\nI imagined myself making these photographs for people back home, people who had never traveled, never made it out of the country, out of their neighborhood, out of their house.\nAnd even though most of these people were family, the others were invented, invisible and didn’t exist. I didn’t think much about who was going to look. Only that someone would. Family? Ghosts? They were all the same. I wanted to show everybody something great, so we could all believe.\nI would sleep on the train. I used the train like a hotel. I would go to the station at ten at night, look up at the big board, the schedule, and pick a city. Florence, Madrid, Frankfurt, Antwerp. It didn’t matter what city, except a city I hadn’t been to.\nWhen I went to Berlin I didn’t know anything about the geography of the city. I didn’t realize that the city was surrounded by Russia. Locked in. An island still surrounded by cold war.\nI was clueless. Uninformed. Uneducated.\nWhen I arrived in the morning I immediately went to Check Point Charlie. I took a photograph. Then I walked around the streets that were boarded by the wall. The day was grey. Overcast. There was hardly anybody out on the street. The closer I got to the wall, the less people on the street. The wall was bad medicine.\nThe wall was real. I could touch it. It wasn’t fiction. It wasn’t part of a novel. Graham Greene’s The Third Man… sure… but there was no zither music or Harry Lyme next to the wall… that would come later.\nThe wall was brick, mortar, cement, stone, and glass. There were places where you could climb up to a platform and look over and look into “no-man’s” land. No-mans land was an empty tract of land that was maybe fifty yards wide. It was full of barbwire. You could see the Russian guards on the other side. Next to the guards were German Sheperds.\nI took five photographs of the wall.\nThe wall worked.\nThe wall, the wire, the guards, the dogs, kept people from escaping from East to West. I wish I had taken more photographs. But I didn’t. I wasn’t thinking like a photographer. I didn’t know how a photographer thought.\nAt least I took five photographs.\nThere were no slides to buy in plastic sleeves of the Berlin Wall outside the Tabac store back in Paris.\nWhen I finally came home and loaded my carousel with my slides, I left the “wall” ones out. No Berlin Wall. I only showed the castles, the canals, the public sculptures, and the views from rooftops. I’m not sure what I had in mind when I excluded the five photographs of The Berlin Wall. MY PHOTOS. Why did I leave them out? All I know is that I mixed in the “store bought” castles with the castles that I took… thinking no one in my family would care or know the difference between mine and theirs.\nIn 2011… forty years after showing my slides to my family in my basement, I would return to France, and show the castles, the public sculptures, the canals, the views of from the rooftops. I would show them in Dijon at the Consortium. An alternative space, the same type of space as Artists Space in NYC.\nI managed to find one “store bought” slide of a castle that I put away, “kept”…that I bought back in '68 outside the Tabac store.\nI put that slide in the show.\nI had the slide mounted in a special frame and put the frame on a plinth, so you could look at the side from both sides, (thru the slide), and put the plinth in the middle of the gallery. I made 20X24” prints of all “the views” and hung them on the wall. Five castles. Five public sculptures. Five Canals. And five views from rooftops. It was strange after all these years to think what I made or didn’t “made”, in 1968… was being exhibited in an art gallery.\nI put up a show at the Consortium when it first opened in 1983. Now they wanted to me inaugurate a new “extension” to their space, and bookend what I did earlier in ‘83. I couldn’t remember what I put up back then, but this time around, it felt like the work from '68 was the Beginning AND The End.\nI didn’t go to the opening back in 1983. And didn’t go to opening in 2011.\nI went to Dijon in 1968.\nI wanted to see the town where James Joyce had Ulysses printed. (My bibliomania was already on me). I don’t think I took any photographs when I was there in 1968. And if I did take any, they’re long gone. I have my memory of the place and it's wrapped up in Greek Flag Blue, the color that Joyce labored over to dust his book in.\nThe Consortium published a catalogue of my new show, but it didn’t come out until four years after the show. I’m not sure why it took so long, but when I got it, I was happy with how it looked. It was radical and conservative at the same time. Small, wrapped in boards, a run of around five hundred. I wrote the essay for the catalogue. I didn’t know who else to ask. I tried to explain the work, the process, and talk about what I was thinking. What I was thinking. I called the essay the Magic Castle.\nI also made prints of the Berlin Wall and put them in the show too. Five “views” of the wall. This time I didn’t leave them out. This was different from my family’s basement. There was no carousel, no projection. My audience wasn’t relatives and ghosts.\nIt was time.\nA lot had past.\nThe wall was there and now its not.\nI took these photographs.\nFive photographs.\nThey were mine.\nWhat’s yours is mine.\nWhat’s mine is yours.\nEither way… the necky smuttoned the dues and I’m finally out the above, grapping and sorting thru piles of herms, delling the flats and saving the safes and pins, sticking and holding my dew waiting waiting… the pasture, the skies, the heaven.\nMine and yours.\n9/24/2014\nYou Tarzan, Me Jane.\nCheetah… now that’s a great name… for a monkey.\nGod only knows?\nNo he doesn't.\nHistory.\nThe word already has the word “story” in it.\nIn 1985 I put together a compilation of artist’s writings and downtown \"avant\" writers and did their portraits and called it Wild History. It was published by Tanam Press. The title comes from the Chinese. The Chinese have two types of history. The regular kind and the “wild” kind. The regular is straightforward. Mao on his way to the revolution. The second kind, the “wild” kind, is Mao FUCKING in the bushes… on the way to the revolution.\nThe second kind is soap opera. Heavy handed. Behind the scenes. Interpretive. The kind where you had to have been there to believe it. Up close. Personal. Drama.\nGod Damn Good Drama.\nMan, I can’t believe what just happened!\nI’ve always wanted to be in the room when history is being made.\nRoomy history.\nNot all the time.\nJust once in awhile.\nIf I could.\nIf not, at least next door.\nI’d like to be able to look back and say… man, that was something, wasn’t it?\nThe trouble.\nThe trouble is, when I READ about what happened, in the room, where I had been, when history was being made… the “report\", the “eye witness\", is fucked. It’s always different, slanted and “storied”. It’s never the same. I say, \"hey… REALLY?”\n“Say what?”\nThat’s not the way I remember it.”\nMore trouble.\nIt‘s never anywhere near what “really” happened. Never anywhere near what I saw and heard when I was there… when I was right there, close and being a part of what was going on. Participating. What I read later, in the paper, the magazine, the essay, the book, or on the screen, is way off, crazy, nuts, and just plain wrong.\nSo how do you react to this new version of “the truth.”\nYou don’t.\nYou don’t say a word.\nHow can you?\nAnd if you do… who’s going to listen?\nJUDAS!\nI don’t believe you.\nThe public version of history, the one that’s printed, HARD COPY, is what people believe. It’s what they believe from an author who has “sources”, most of them un-named. And even though the “story” will be “second-hand”, they’ll be no point in complaining or trying to convince anyone who’s reading the story… that what they just read, is fabricated, counterfeit, “cooked up”.\nWhy bother?\nYou want the truth about Franz Kline and Betty Page? You can’t have it. Why? You won't believe it.\nMy version will be irrelevant. My truth will have no consequence. My experience is just something that I’m going to have to live with. Alone. I mind as well write it down, put it in a bottle, and throw it in the ocean. I might be able to share it, but with whom? Who’s going to believe me? Who’s going to care? Who’s going to give a shit?\nGo tell it on the mountain.\nI’ve kept a diary of the different “rooms” I’ve been in over the years, the “history rooms”… but the diary is under lock and key and hidden away in a secret draw held down by a stack of bibles. It’s buried next to my last will and testimony, dutifully inscribed and written in code. “In the event of my death, my march to the revolution is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. My hand to God.”\nHand of God was one of those rooms I was in, on my way to the revolution.\nDefinition of Hand Of God…\nHand of god involves multiple women administering a hand job to one man. Each woman takes it, in turns, (which are timed by whatever means deemed appropriate). The winner is the one to bring him to climax during their turn.\nI swear.\nGym Joyce swear.\nThe whole truth and nothing but the truth. So help me God.\n9/22/2014\nUntitled Protest\nWe moved to Weymouth Mass. when I was ten. A couple of towns over from Braintree, my first home in the Americas after my family moved up from Panama. The house was on the water. Not a beach. It was more a large bay, greasy and filled with flotsam. The bay led to the Weymouth Navel shipyard. This beach is where I would start beach combing. Finding stuff. Things that washed up and were free. Claiming.\nBig tankers would pass by and every once in awhile a new cruiser or destroyer would sail by… to where, I didn’t know. I didn’t care. Maybe Vietnam. I wasn’t interested in anything military. I didn’t have any of the discipline it took to be a soldier. Following orders, being controlled, wasn't for me. And even though I was only ten, I had already associated, “in the service”, with disappointment, depression, being bullied and crapped on. Like I said. I was ten. What did I know?\nLet me explain…\nBack in Braintree, (before Weymouth)… my backyard neighbor was a woman named Mrs. McBride. I think her first name was Helen. Mrs. McBride lost her oldest son in Vietnam. The loss was in 1958, 1959? Way before we were suppose to be over there in what would become an undeclared war. Who knows why he was there. Secret stuff. Something to do with the French. Something to do with “special forces”. Part of a small liaison nosing around a foreign country, keeping tabs on communists and dominos. I was way to young to understand a death like that. Except what I did understand was the change Mrs. McBride underwent. The way she stopped talking. The way she stopped saying hello and asking me over. It was like a body snatcher invaded her body and the snatcher made her sit down in her closed-in porch and stare all day at her garden… a garden that was once full of all kinds of things to eat, but now, was quietly turning into a pile of weeds.\nMy age didn’t get the losing part. I got the zombie part but I didn't get the losing.\nAs long as I had known Mrs. McBride her son was someone she adored and talked about with beaming pride. I’m not sure if I even met him. All I knew about him was “hanky talk”. To me she was the milk and cookie lady. Someone who was kind and treated me like a relative. After her son died she closed down and walked around in her sleeping clothes and slippers. I knew she’d never be the same and never forgive whatever made him disappear. She called his disappearance, “missing in action”.\nShe would never get rid of the grief. She was done with life and hated that she had to go on living. For a parent, out living your children makes you give up. You get dark and collect dust.\nMaybe twenty years later? (1980?) I was in Washington D.C. and visited the Vietnam War Memorial. It was emotional. Complicated. I was in front of a slab of granite that had all the names of the dead soldiers who died in Vietnam etched into its surface. This was a war that I resisted and protested and denounced. I was standing in front of that huge blackish headstone and I started to cry. I’m not sure what took over. The feelings were overwhelming. I balled uncontrollably and felt like all these names were alive, right next to me, and were calling out to me saying “hey man, no biggie… wake us when it’s over. We’re all together now, still dialing it in… bad ass motherfuckers.”\nI started to look for the name Peter McBride. Born? Died? 1959? It wasn’t there. There were other McBride’s. Fifteen of them. And two Peter’s. But none off them with the right birth and death dates. This kind of absence was a different motherfucker. They left him off. He wasn’t included. He was erased. In government speak “redacted”. He should have been there and his exclusion was more than “regulated”, it was embarrassing.\nI’m not sure I’m capable of writing about what remains. What I can say is that when I think about the missing of Peter McBride I sometimes feel a little like his mother. I feel blank. Invaded. Hopeless. Other times I feel pissed off. I’m pissed that there was nothing there. No memory. He wasn’t part of anything and every thing that happened to him was forgotten and covered up and stupid. It’s the way things are. Peter McBride’s history is a fairytale. Fucked up, top secret, and classified. His life, like all the rest of the carved names, meaningless. A shallow grave. There’s no point in making any sense of it. War, truce, treaty. It’ll just keep happening again and again. Forever. Maybe that’s why I was crying. What’s set in stone is deader than a door nail. Or better, I’ll leave to Shakespeare… “I pray more that I may never eat grass again.”\nMrs. McBride was the one who died in Vietnam. And her name wasn’t on the Vietnam Memorial either.\n9/17/2014\n7th Heaven… A chapter from “Tell Me Everything”.\nJeff Koons was the first artist that I met, that when I saw his work I thought… this guy’s making art like I wanted it to be made.\nWhich is to say… he wasn’t making art.\nWhich is to say… he was making art but didn’t care if it looked like art.\nWhich is to say… he was making art, but it’s NOT ART YET.\nWhich is to say… maybe one of these days, it will, it might, it could...\nWhich is to say… I’m asking a lot. I mean, “I’M” not asking… the art that I’m making is asking.\nWhich is to say… I don’t give a shit.\nI don’t give a shit.\nJeff, I would later find out, would never say, “I don’t give a shit.” What he was making was the truth and he would never associate “his truth” with not giving a shit.\nJeff gave a shit.\nJeff believed.\nHe wasn’t punk.\nHe wasn’t beat.\nHe wasn’t hippie.\nHe wasn’t wave.\nHe wasn’t a “no” wave.\nHe wasn’t blank.\nHe was neo, post, or lost.\nJeff was hard to describe.\nAnd what he was doing was hard to describe.\nBy 1980 Jeff would describe.\nAnd how he would describe it was simple.\nHe was new.\nAnd what he was doing was “the new.”\nBut I’m way ahead.\nBeep Beep Beep.\nBack up.\nFirst… my first meeting.\nIn 1977, I had taken my first “re-photograph.” I photographed advertisements of living rooms. Four advertisements of four different living rooms that appeared in the magazine section of the New York Times Sunday Magazine. Instead of tearing out the pages and pasting them up on paper and “collaging” them… I took my camera and cropped the images with my 35mm lens and loaded 160Tungsten color slide film inside the camera, and snapped away at the magazine page… avoiding the copy and concentrating on what was being advertised. After staring thru the lens and making the exposure, I sent four slides to a commercial lab in Midtown and told them to blow the slides up to 20 by 24 inches on ektacolor photo paper. When I got the photographs back, I cut mats for each photograph and put them in generic wooden frames. I hung them up on the wall, side by side. They looked like real photographs because they were real photographs.\nSo that was where I was at.\nAllan Jones came by to see these “re-photographs.”\nI was living at 308 West 11th St. in the West Village in a garden apartment that I couldn’t afford and shared with a girl who wasn’t my girlfriend.\nI’m not sure where or how I met Allan, but I thought at the time, Allan was going to be my Andre Breton.\nHe smoked Gauloise cigarettes and even wore French “tinted” glasses.\nHe was a connector.\nHe introduced people to each other and was always saying he was writing about the connections. He connected all right. But I never read anything about what he connected.\nAfter he came over and saw my “living rooms” he told me about Jeff, and said, “you have to meet this guy.”\nIt would take about eight months before I made it over to Jeff’s apartment.\nJeff lived on the west side of the East Village. Near Cooper Union, next to Phebe’s restaurant.\nI can’t remember if Allan was there, maybe he left after we arrived… but I remember being alone with Jeff in his first floor street side studio apartment.\nHe had these half inflated plastic flowers that he’d bought on Canal St. and had carefully placed them on square mirrors that were on the floor up against the wall. They reminded me of Smithson a little. But only a little.\nThe first thing he said to me, almost like an apology, was that he felt bad that the “flowers” were only half filled with air but that he didn’t want to stretch them out at the moment. He said something like, “I’m afraid if I filled them up, all the way, with air right now, they wouldn’t be the same when it comes time to show them in a gallery.”\nAll the way.\nI thought about that… standing there… looking at the droops that were part of the positions the petals were in, and immediately agreed. “Yea, I get it... you want to conserve their potential and save them.”\nHe was deliberate. There was no irony or slapstick in his explanation. He was sincere. And his sincerity was a big fucking hello.\nTo say \"good morning and really mean it.\"\nYour welcome.\nI knew right there I had found a Compadre.\nA long fellow. A fellow traveler. Someone like-minded. Someone who I didn’t have to think twice about. There was no hesitation. Nothing was interrupted. I was meeting someone who understood details. Presentation. Someone who knew their subject and how to propose and marry it. How to show it off without fucking it up. How to take it and make it again. How to make sure it ended up looking as natural as it had been in the first place.\nWho cares if it looks like art…\nLets just fill this thing with just enough air to make it look like what it’s supposed to be.\nAnd what was it supposed to be?\nIt was supposed to be what it was suppose to be.\nHats off to Gertrude? To Marcel? To Andy?\nNo. No hats.\nNot even close.\nIf we were going to tip our hats to anyone, anything... it would be to Rod Serling, Jack Parr, Looney Tunes and Captain Kangaroo.\nLike I said, “in the first place.” And then, the second... and then?\nThird Place.\nI started hanging around with Jeff at an East Village bar called the Red Bar. The Red Bar was sterile and overly lit. It had no personality. It had just opened. There was some kind of retro thing going on with the décor and the jukebox played records by the Box Tops and Tommy James and the Shondells. I guess we hung there because it was convenient.\nWe tried picking up girls at the bar but were unsuccessful. Not once did we ever leave the bar in the company of a female.\nAfter two or three beers Jeff was a loose cannon. It took a bit more spirits for me to drop my guard. (Alcohol would later become a subject that both of us would process. Jeff, with “degradation”. Me, with monochromatic jokes).\nJeff wasn’t like those shmucks from Cal Arts. Or RISD. Or Hallwalls. (Places both of us were just becoming aware of in 1978). We had our own “shmuck” going on and it had nothing to do with institutions, schools, parties, groups, labels, movements, alternatives, friends.\nWe had no friends.\nJeff was in another orbit. The man who fell to earth. He didn't have any die-hard Bowie fans yet, but he could lip sync a pretty good version of Pop Goes The Weasel.\nJeff was looking to have a bridge named after him. \"If Brooklyn could, why not me?\"\nOr maybe the bridge was a Zeppelin thing.\nJeff wanted his work, \"lead\" heavy. Just like the stairways Jimmy Page use to saw on his guitar.\n\"Can anyone find the damn bridge.\"\nJeff had a job selling subscriptions at MOMA and I had a job at Time-Life. We worked in the same neighborhood.\nDead-ends?\nNot really.\nI think we both turned our situations into advantages. There was nothing else to do. We both had to work. We both had to make a living.\nHe turned his selling into a kind of performance and I turned the magazines that Time-Life published into art supplies.\nTwo things about 1980.\nThe New Museum windows and Jeff’s apartment on Fifth and 18th St.\nFirst the apartment…\nWhen I walked into Jeff’s apartment building on Fifth and 18th it was full on fancy. A palace? No. I wouldn't go that far. But it wasn't \"brick\". Let's just say it was pleasure to be sad.\nMy place on Ave. A and 12thSt. was a broken down tenement. One of those railroad apartments with the tub in the kitchen. Worn and torn. Dirt cheap. A shit-hole.\nJeff’s Fifth and 18th place was the complete opposite. Spruced. The Nines. Nice digs.\nHe met me in the lobby and I had to ask him, “You’re kidding me, right”?\nHe said, “No. When I signed the lease I paid the first and last month. It’s going to take them at least a year to get me out.”\nAt first I didn’t understand.\n“You mean you’re not going to pay rent anymore?”\n“Exactly,” he said.\nI think my response was, “FUCK.”\nLooking back, that way of negotiating your budget didn’t have anything to do with balls or hutzpah. It has to do with DETERMINATION.\nThe decision not to pay rent before you move in… to make the decision part of your plan, your future, your lifestyle… something that could be described as “under the circumstances”… wasn’t really brilliant as much as it was “getting the job done.”\nHe knew his legal rights but he also really wanted that apartment and this was the only way he could pay for it. He was willing to take on the wrath of the landlord. (Dear Landlord). Management was going to be royally pissed about not getting their money every month, but eviction and debt wasn’t what kept Jeff up at night.\nI could already tell that money wasn’t something Jeff gave two shits about.\nWhat kept Jeff up at night was “raising” money, not making it.\nWe go up to the apartment.\nI walk in and there’s no furniture. Wall to wall carpet. Clean. Whistle clean. There’s a brand new washer dryer, side by side, sitting in the living room. There’s a teakettle mounted on fluorescent fixtures hanging on the wall and there’s an upright vacuum cleaner encased in plexiglass with more fluorescents lighting the “Hoover” from beneath. This “cleaning object” occupied most of the tiny kitchen.\nIt was like the apartment was a safe house. A place to store stolen goods. “Fencing” came to mind. Witness protection. A wish list from Sears and Roebuck.\n“I’ll pick door number three.”\nI expected the apartment to suddenly turn around on one of those revolving platforms and I’d be suddenly stuttering my choice of door to Bill Cullen of the Price Is Right.\nCome On Down.\nSo I’m standing there, (again the standing) and looking around and the only sign of real furniture is a bed that’s neatly made. Looks like its been made for military inspection. I half expected the closet to hold a freshly laundered khaki uniform. Crisply ironed. With a bunch of merit badges highlighting archery and personal fitness.\nAttention.\nRevelry.\nSalute.\nAnd that’s it.\nNot a stick.\nI don’t think there was a nightstand or even a lamp.\nI don’t remember checking out the bathroom.\nBut if I did I’m sure the medicine cabinet would have been filled with lotion, aspirin, and mouth wash. I don’t think there would have been any surprises behind the mirror.\nSo what’s getting me is the washer/dryer. This “tag-team” even has the energy labels still attached. And I’m saying “so ahh…What-Is-Up?\nAnd Jeff says, “The New.”\nEverything is brand new.\nThat’s his turn. His twist. His contribution. His continuation. His \"third place.\"\nAnd his “new,” immediately makes sense.\nI like the sense and I like what it makes.\nMaking sense is something that good art does.\nSometimes.\nThe apartment is a showroom.\nAnd even though what he’s showing are store bought appliances… that small gesture of not touching what is generally… immediately, unpacked and “plugged in,” is, in the words of Madison Ave., “a big bright flash of white light.”\nTurn On, Drop Out, Plug In.\nThat’s what happened at the New Museum.\nWhen Jeff was invited to make a show in the windows. (This was when The New Museum was on 6th Ave. and 14th St.).\nHe somehow got the museum to buy him four vacuum cleaners and the story goes… that one of them got plugged in and he found out and told the staff that he couldn’t use it. It was “used.” Old. “No good.” Its integrity had been compromised. He told them they would have to go out and buy another. The same. The same kind. A whole new vacuum cleaner.\nAnd of course the New Museum had no budget, but what could they do?\nJeff’s foot was down and unless the object was BRAND NEW… the object became irrelevant, second hand, garbage.\nAnd who would know if it had ever been plugged in you ask…?\nWho would know that a perfectly fine vacuum cleaner without a scratch on it or even a “suggestion” of a scratch…\nSeriously?\nWho would know?\nWell…\nYou know who.\nWild History.\nBefore I forget… two things…\nWhen Jeff was selling Salvador Dali Gold Medallions for some Wall Street bullshit boiler room…(I don’t think Jeff was ever a real trader)… I was one of his few knuckle-headed customers who bought one of the medallions before the company got raided, shut down, and forced out of business. I bought the medallion for a thousand buckaroos and redeemed it after his office got busted for nine hundred and fifty dollars. I lost fifty but I still have the certificate of authenticity. That’s got to be worth what?\nA Bonanza…\nIn 1986 I was living at 303 Gallery on Park Ave. South and Lisa Spellman exhibited Jeff’s “equilibrium” tanks. She showed a one ball, a two ball and a three-ball tank. Every night when I got up to take a leak, the light from the street lamp would shine in the window and throw a spotlight, a beautiful religious glow covered the tanks and solarized the floating basketballs. For six weeks, every time I would get up to take a piss… the middle of the night would transform into a wonderful tangerine dream.\nThe Thief and The Soundtrack.\nThe turtle and the hare.\nA quick detour.\nI was always pissed at Meyer Vaisman for organizing that show in ’87 at Sonnabend Gallery which included Koons, Haim Steinbach, Peter Halley, Ashley Bickerton and Meyer Vaisman. (Yes, he put himself into the show). I didn’t even realize Meyer was an artist. My relationship with him was both as a friend and a dealer. I thought Meyer was terrific dealer and ran a great gallery and I couldn’t wrap my head around the do’s and don’ts of why he would want to give both himself and the artists he was showing away to an established blue chip gallery that was already well known and respected and steeped in a thirty year history of Pop, Minimalism, Post Minimalism and Conceptual Art.\nBlindsided.\nI didn’t get it.\nWhat I wanted was territory that “we” claimed. That belonged to us.\nMeyer’s International With Monument was the place to be. And I really liked its outsider status. I know outside can turn inside in a heartbeat, but I really thought I had finally found a gallery that was an “all for one and one for all”… a \"helluva\" clubhouse.\nI had a couple of shows there and so did Sarah Charlesworth and Gretchen Bender. Even Vito Acconci made an appearance. Halley, Koons, Steinbach, Bickerton all had at least two shows there. It was open on Sunday, like the rest of the East Village galleries, and everybody loved dealing with Meyer. He was a born salesman. I thought he was the next Leo Castelli. I thought he had it made.\nI was wrong.\nNaïve? Yes.\nDisappointed? Yes.\nWhat could I do about it? Leave.\nMeyer was the first “young” artist I'd heard talk about money. How much money his work was selling for. And how much it would sell for in the future. I couldn’t listen. The sound of his posture was a terrible rattle. Commands. It was like he was sitting in a rickshaw and I was pulling it.\nSong and dance.\nHeadache.\nMigraine.\nLife support.\nI told him I was the wrong artist to talk about the financial side of the art world. Commodities and \"positions\" were things I didn't feel comfortable with. Foreign. Foreign and fog. My relationship with money was complicated and I hated hearing Meyer bragging on about how much one his paintings would be worth some day. “Some day” implied the future and I couldn’t see past the afternoon.\nWhat future?\nThe Sonnabend show was accompanied by a cover story in New York magazine.\nI remember the article starting off with a portrait of Ashley Bickerton. The portrait was like a Hollywood publicity picture. Stock. Generic. Set up. Fake. What can I say? I thought it was good portrait. The way Ashley came over reminded me of a young Marlon Brando. I didn’t know Ashley very well but I recognized he was “on the make” and it didn’t take long to realize that young artists not only thought about making money from their work, but EXPECTED to make money from their work.\nMove\nOver\nRover\nLump me in?\nJose can answer that.\n“No way.”\nI was holding out for greener pastures. Fluorescent Pastures. Why?\nMamma Tried.\nBad genes.\nAngry.\nDisowned.\nI feed the hand that bites me.\nI almost cut my hair.\nGroucho Marx.\nWooly Bully.\nAll of the above.\nI shot the sheriff.\nI had a problem with \"squares.\" \"Straights.\" Something to do with my relatives. No need to bleed about it here. There was nothing kindly about the blood. I wanted to get as far away from kinship as possible.\nThe idea of being “understood” contributed to the fall of western civilization. I read that somewhere. The somewhere might have been referring to 1913 but certain ideas about misunderstanding never change.\nDo I really want to be part of a new wave?\nYes I know… I’m moaning and complaining and sounding like my shit don’t stink. Roses Are Blue. Violets Are Red.\nHere take my card... it's not engraved but it's creamy and sparkles.\n\"Rong & Rong.\"\nMy address is on the other side... it says it right there...\n\"Just around the corner.\"\nAnyone can find me.\nI sound like some kind of infomercial.\nThe show at Sonnabend that Meyer put together, which would be called “neo-geo,” ushered in another shift, and its participants would soon join the Sonnabend stable.\nThis is the show where Jeff showed his “rabbit”, and took off.\nSee you later.\nScram.\nWile E Coyote.\nIt was all up hill from there.\nRoadrunner Roadrunner.\n\"I knew a guy so rich, he could ski up hill.\"\nIt was hard to relate to Meyer as an artist but I tried.\nI bought some of his work and still own one of his “turkeys.” I went in “halves” on a giant painting of his with Lisa Spellman and after Lisa and I parted ways, I bought her out and unfortunately didn’t have the proper custodial “where with all” to curate the painting. I was dead broke in the mid-nineties, and had moved upstate and stored the painting in a barn. Sadly, the mice got it. Ate it. Literally gnawed the shit out of the canvas. I was selling off most of my collection to make ends meet but nobody wanted the Vaisman. This was 1995. Seven years after the Geo show. Things didn’t quite work out for most of the Geo’s and Meyer fell hard. Of the five, Koons continued to chug. He’s been working on the railroad ever since. Full steam ahead. Even when he tied his femme fatale Cicciolina to the railroad tracks, he rescued himself, instead of her.\nWinston ‘O Link.\nIron Horse.\nEasy Rider.\nHow The West Was Won.\nMonopoly.\nSeduction.\nO’Sexaul.\nWhat did the artist say to the porn star?\nAt least I’m not an asshole.\nI still have Vaisman’s Turkey sculpture and luckily it’s in great shape. Its wooden pedestal doubled as a storage box and for twenty years the stuffed turkey hasn’t been touched by feast or famine. I took it out about six months ago and it looks good. What I mean to say… it not only survived, but it LOOKS GOOD.\nLooks Good Survive…\nKind of a haiku.\nThat’s all any of us ever wants…\nA good haiku.\nThanksgiving.\nI parted company.\nI lost touch.\nI got divorced.\nAnd split.\nI’m not sure I spoke to any of those cats and kiddies for ten years.\nI met Colin de Land.\nI met Christopher Wool.\nI met Robert Gober.\nI met Charlie Ray.\nI met Cady Noland.\nI met Matthew Barney.\nI met Marlene Dumas.\nI met Dusty Rhodes.\nThe\nBIRDTALK\n3/27/2014\nSix Inches, Nine Months...\nSomeone just reminded me about D H Lawrence's paintings. Yea, D.H. painted. They're \"adult\" paintings and I've always thought that the few that remain are pretty interesting. (The reason there are so few is that he had one exhibition in England during his lifetime and the authorities closed it down on the grounds that it was \"pornographic\". Sounds familiar. After Lawrence died his relatives were \"embarrassed\" by the paintings and threw most of them out with the garbage). I just re-read Lady Chatterly's Lover and have to say that I wasn't impressed this time around. If it was a choice between the prose and the paintings... I'd take a painting. There are maybe seventeen paintings left. Most of which reside in New Mexico at some little hacienda near Taos. Who knew right? A lot of \"famous\" author's \"dabbled\" in the fine arts. Sylvia Plath. EE Cummings. T.S. Eliot. Even Kerouac. From time to time some of my book dealers call me up and offer me a pastel on paper from one of these author's. But I've never been offered a D H Lawrence. That I would go for. Strange fruit. That's what they remind me off... strange fruit. There's something forbidden about them and I can understand how back then... when he showed them, the authorities had little to say in the matter and had no choice but to shut it down. (Law abiding? Lawrence? I don't think so). Lawrence wasn't some Sunday painter. I'm sure he painted on Sunday but the final result had nothing to do with \"the day of rest\". In fact the \"nuns\" in his paintings have their britches hiked up to reveal their swollen vulvas and are pictured fornicating in fields of hay. Tropic of Cancer. Henry Miller. Candy. Terry Southern. Lolita. Nabokov. I've got them all. Every edition. Every permutation. The one thing I have, special, from Lawrence, is a limited edition of Chatterly's Lover. It's signed, in an edition of one hundred copies. The number on my copy? You guessed it... 69. What can I say? The re-read might not of held up this time around... but at least I got the one, the only... the lovely number.\n3/23/2014\nUntitled\nMy daughter and I went to the Whitney yesterday. And before going up to the fifth floor to see some of the permanent collection, went downstairs and had a bite to eat in their Untitled restaurant. We'd never been to the Whitney restaurant. We gave our name to the hostess and she told us it would be a twenty minute wait. We sat down on one of the four \"daybeds\" they have just outside the restaurant and waited. I sat facing a wall looking at framed art work that looked familiar. I got up and walked over for a closer look and recognized the work to be an edition of Dennis Oppenheim \"projects\". I told my daughter that this was what art looked liked when I arrived in NYC in 1973-74. (At least the kind of art that I was looking at). She said, \"really... it doesn't look like art to me\". \"Are you sure that's what you were looking at\"? Good question. I told her it's Avalanche Art. She said, \"what's that\"? I didn't bother to explain, except to say that a lot of the art that was being done back in the late sixties, early seventies wound up looking like a document. I said come over here and look at this one, the one where Oppenheim is shoveling concentric circles on a snow covered lake... this one is \"famous\". She said, \"famous for what\"? I didn't bother to explain \"the famous\". She sat back down and I loitered in front of the rest of the \"documents\" until our name was called. I kept thinking about how Oppenheim and the others in his crew (Smithson, Peter Hutchinson, Vito Acconci) used the camera in ways that would directly involved me later. I spent a bit more time in front the document of the guard dogs... the German Sheperds that he used in a fenced off area outside of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. I remember actually \"seeing for myself\" that piece. I think around 1970-71? I liked the format of the information. The way Oppenheim \"presented\" the results. Photos. After photos and \"plans\" and drawings on a single piece of paper. Schematics. The look of the document was \"engineered\".\nAfter we sat down... (my seat was such that I still had a direct view over to the wall of Oppenheim documents)... I couldn't help but notice that everybody who walked by the wall where the framed pieces hung, didn't bother to look at them or, if they did, they looked and quickly looked away... as if what they were looking at didn't register or if it did register, what they were registering was something that looked like architectural blueprints that had to do with the new building the Whitney was putting up downtown. It didn't take long before I realized that Dennis Oppenheim \"project\" pieces were invisible to the majority of the gallery goers. (If they were gallery goers at all). I figured most of the \"goers\" who were downstairs came down to eat. They were hungry. Looking at art, even Avalanche Art wasn't on the... menu. (that's a resist, no resist).\nWe finished our lunch and headed upstairs. My daughter made me walk up the five flights. (\"No elevator for you Dadee'O\"). The first room off the fifth floor staircase was devoted to four paintings by Jasper Johns and a suite of etching he did based on the \"four seasons\". There was one of his \"famous\" flag paintings and one of his \"famous\" targets... this one... all white encaustic. (I've always liked the encaustic \"target\" paintings). My daughter okayed it... (she was really here to see the O'Keeffe)... and asked what the big deal was about the flag painting. Again... I backed away.\nI'm not a teacher, I'm not an educator, I'm not a coach. And I wasn't about to go into why John's \"flags\" came out of the fifties and whole heartedly represented their time and continue to be looked at and fawned over and talked about. I've alway thought Johns \"made\" good paintings... I didn't want to talk to my daughter about \"construction\" and folk art or how I thought the \"flags\" weren't really paintings... I didn't want to talk to her about \"craft\"... I mean why bother... she'll see them again, another day... they're permanent...\nAnyway... before we went to see the O'Keeffe...\nJohn's painting, the one to the left of the flag... Untitled (1996)... man, what's that about? That's what I kept asking.\nMy daughter said, \"what\"?\nI said, \"what's this about\"?\nShe said, \"how should I know, your the one looking at it\".\nAnd that was that.\nNothing else to say.\nShe was right.\nI was the one looking at it and I didn't understand a thing about it. Nothing. The painting looked as confused as I was. Seriously, what the fuck? What was this painting doing here? I retreated and caught up with my daughter.\nI hate when that happens.\nTo leave a room of paintings feeling... disloyal. It's not fair.\n\"Hey wait... wait for me\".\n3/21/2014\nA blonde, brunette and a redhead are in a desert.\nThe brunette says, \"I brought some water so we don't get dehydrated\".\nThe redhead says, \"I brought some suntan lotion so we don't get sunburned\".\nThen the blonde says, \"I brought a car door\".\nThe other two girls say, \"Why did you bring a car door\"?\nThe blonde says, \"So I can roll down the window if it gets hot\".\nIn 1985 I hooked up with a girl who had just broken up with Jean Michel Basquiat. When I went to her apartment she had a large un-stretched canvas of one of his paintings hanging in her living room. I told her if she wanted me to move in with her the painting had to go. I didn't mean she had to get rid of it... just roll it up and put it in the closet.\nThe next day I came by carrying my clothes and stuff in some kind of garbage bag. The painting wasn't on the wall.\nI lived with this girl for a year before having a nervous breakdown and moving out to L.A.\nI often wonder what happened to this particular Basquiat painting. I know if I saw it again, I would recognize it.\nOf course I was wrong about Basquiat in '85... I couldn't see thru my own concerns and measures and didn't want to give him \"nothin\"... even the time of day. Was it jealousy? Not really.\nI was aware of what he was up to and it was, at the time, the total opposite of what I was thinking about.\nI needed to stick to my guns... even if it meant being on the wrong side of what the art world was going on about.\nNot giving in. Stubborn. Up against the wall motherfucker.\nIt was all good.\nI use to see him sitting alone in the middle of the Odeon, having dinner by himself. All alone at a table for four. Smack dab in the middle of the place. Out there for all to see. Like he was a parade of one. I thought this \"position\" was pretty great, pretty cool, pretty \"up yours\".\nThis ex-girlfreind of his... I couldn't imagine why she wanted to go out with me.\nI was nowhere.\nI was lucky to get a seat at the bar.\nBut she saw something and I think what she saw was this...\nThe something that I was doing... in the near future... would be the norm...\nNot anytime soon. But soon.\nLike I said... I was lucky.\nI was doing... making, \"gangs\" in '85.\nTaking images from \"lifestyle\" magazines, rephotographing them and then choosing around nine images from each magazine to represent what the magazine was about.\nSurfer magazines. Biker. Humor. Cartoon magazines. Beauty mags. Hotrod mags. It seemed back then every lifestyle had its own magazine. Sometimes several. There must of been twelve magazines out there for the \"outlaw\" motorcyclist.\nIf you were \"enthusiastic\" you had your own magazine.\nWhen I went to the news-stand I'd spend all afternoon picking up the monthly's and taking twenty-five away in a shopping bag. Getting home and opening them up and \"paging\" thru them was the best part. The anticipation of coming across a photo that I could zero in on and \"claim\" was exciting. I would \"tear-sheet\" the image and put it in a pile. After a day of looking I'd have a stack of good ones, great ones and \"almosts\".\nI'd re-photograph the best that night with color slide film... send the film into the lab the next day and by the day after that, empty the boxes of 36 slides out onto the my giant custom-made light box.\nI start to shuffle the \"chromes\" around.\nIt was kind of like dj'aying images.\nThe \"girlfriends\" from the Biker magazine's were the first \"gangs\".\nThese were photographs of real girlfriends that the boyfriend would take and send into the magazine and the magazine would then publish... and, I suspect, the boyfriend after seeing his girlfriend in the mag, would then buy the magazine. At least that was one scenario. It sounds it, but it wasn't complicated. The girl next door WAS the girl next door.\nI'd pick nine color slides and grid them together and hold them with scotch tap, tapping them together by their paper cardboard mounts.\nI'd send in the gird of nine and the photo lab would make an 8X10\" inter-negative and then we'd print from that one giant neg and put all nine images on a giant piece of photo paper. Fifty inches wide. Eighty six inches high.\nThe nine individual images were seamless and measured out to be around 8X10\" on the new giant photo. Almost the same size as I originally saw for the first time. The space between each photo would be the space of the original slide mount. Formally, there was very little aesthetic decision. The more formality that was dictated, the better I liked it.\nThe \"gangs\" were mounted and framed. It was like having a whole show of a particular subject matter in one frame. Instead of having a whole room of \"girlfriends\"... I could have a FRAME of girlfriends.\nThis is the way it worked for me in '85.\nI think MY GIRLFRIEND saw this way of working and didn't care if it fit into \"what was or wasn't happening\" in the art world.\nShe sided with me, with my \"gangs\"...\nShe lived with her Basquiat in her closet.\nIt wouldn't be to long though, before I'd build my own closet.\n\"MY PARENTS KEPT ME IN CLOSET. UNTIL I WAS FIFTEEN I THOUGHT I WAS A SUIT.\nI made some gang jokes but pretty soon I realized that I needed to paint the jokes. So that's what I did. I found a \"subject\" that I could paint. I started PAINTING jokes.\nShe hung one of the first painted jokes in her living room.\nIt was modest. Not very colorful. The ink in the \"screen\" of the joke (I remember) quickly faded and cracked.\nWe broke up soon after I painted it... soon after she hung it.\nWe broke up because I was always drunk and couldn't ever come to terms with the fact that she wanted to be with me.\nMaybe because she believed in me... I never believed her. Or something stupid like that. I don't know. That old Groucho story about any club that would want me as a member. Like I said... I was drunk a lot and the only thing I was focused on was my jokes.\nThis wouldn't be the last time. The drunk... the focus... the membership...\nI'm not sure where that first joke ended up.\nI wondered about the next boyfriend.\nI knew him.\nHe was a musician.\nA rock'n roll guy.\nMaybe he asked to have the joke taken down. Put in the closet. Next to the Basquiat. Side by side. I don't know. It was a hall closet. There were overcoats and boots and an umbrella and a couple of hat boxes and some yellow rain gear to wear when it got nasty out. Like a nor-easter. It was getting pretty crowded in there. That yellow rain-gear. I always wondered about that outfit. I could never figure that one out. It looked like it belonged to someone who worked in a lighthouse from Gloucester Mass.\nThe Blonde. The Brunette. The Redhead.\nThat's the joke that might or might not be in the closet next to the 'nor easter...\nThis last BIRDTALK is an uncorrected excerpt \"sketch\"... from an ongoing memory or memoir book entitled TELL ME EVERYTHING... a book that I'm trying to put together for or by the year 2018. I have an agent, but I won't sign a contract. Who knows. Maybe I'll just write it ALL OUT HERE.\nOn a side note about Basquiat: He had the chops... but he also had the subject matter. I think that's the difference. A lot of artists have \"chops\" but their subject matter more often than not is flimsy... false. It's like they're afraid to admit that they LIKE something. That they're CLOSE to something. They end up with GESTURE. When all is said and done there's nothing true about \"what\" they're painting. When Basquiat painted Sugar Ray Robinson you believed him.\nAnother side note about '85, the girlfriend and her apartment: The apartment was on the eleventh floor of a doorman building on Second Ave. and 21st St. Downstairs in one of the storefronts, just before I moved in... (like maybe two days before I moved in)... The World Of Video opened up. This was the first \"video\" rental store to open in Manhattan. And not only was it IN the building... my new girlfriend had cable TV AND a Betamax and VHS machine hooked into a fairly large Sony TV. (She had this hardware because she'd just started working for Warner Bros. making music videos). I don't know how cutting edge this stuff was, but all I knew now... was I could finally answer the question... Why I Go To The Movies Alone.\n3/20/2014\nModest Fury...(After Pete Seeger... or, \"With God On My Side\", unplugged)\nMullah Mohammed Omar. If you are dead... good. If you are not... you will be.\nYou destroyed the Giant Buddhas of Bamiyan. Yes I know. The destruction took place over a decade ago. But I have not forgotten this. There is nothing to fear from a pre-Islamic past. This is not the first time an illiterate shit for brains asshole has reduced \"graven\" images to ashes. (And I understand that it will not be the last). But I just wanted to remind you that in your case... your punishment will never be pardoned. I cremate you everyday.\n3/18/2014\nMy friend Hudson died last week. I loved him and will miss him. In one word... Sphinx.\n3/17/2014\nToday, Vito Acconci is my favorite artist.\nI'm two and half years pregnant.\nWashington DC might be the strangest city I've ever been too. (There's no pulse and I wondered if there was anything behind the buildings. They reminded me of false fronts. Like towns that are built on a Hollywood backlot). The first time I visited...in 1971... I was arrested for protesting the Vietnam War. I was put in a bus along with other students and we sat parked, in the middle of an avenue, in a cloud of tear gas. We were then taken to some jail, booked, fingerprinted and photographed, before being released. Somewhere deep in a sub-basement behind one of those buildings there's a manilla folder in a cardboard box with my rap sheet. How do I know this? I don't. I'm guessing. But if I was to bet on it, I believe that some half-ass silver tongue congress man would use this information to keep me from entering the straight world.\nThis past weekend I spent two and half days in the convention center watching teenage girls from all over the country, (one was my daughter)... playing volleyball. There were THOUSANDS of girls. There was no one demonstrating. It was peaceful. The focus was on competition. On Saturday evening my wife and I took a break from the kids and started to watch the second season of House Of Cards.\n(Unless you were part of the Wether Underground...this is the kind of BirdTalk that use to be scribbled into notebooks that were then put away into old wooden hope chests and left up in the attic next to a lot of other crap that no one in anybody's family cared about).\nOn May 9th I will show a new art piece entitled FRIENDS. Part of the piece will first appear as a page in a national magazine that's been curated by a good friend. The issue has to do with the idea of summer. Or at least that's what I was told. Asked to add a comment about the idea of summer, I came up the thought that summer reminded me of friendship. (It's about the best I could come up with). I don't like \"commenting\" on what, if anything, my work suggests. Interpretation isn't my strong suit. What I do try and focus on is Title. I've always tried and given my \"pieces\" the most descriptive titles that I can think of. Before the magazine \"went to bed\" I quickly added to \"friendship\"... The Family Stone. The Family Stone referring to Sly... and his hit song in the summer of '69. (I'm not sure if this addition made the deadline). But if it did or didn't, my thoughts on summer should read... Friendship and The Family Stone.\nFulton Ryder is no longer working on the railroad at 75th and Park Ave.\n2/12/2014\nThe Banal Zone\nA couple of people out there... people I don't know... have \"alerted\" me to the fact that somebody, (or bodies)... from China have been re-painting my Canal Zone paintings and are showing them in NYC until Feb. 16th. At the moment I don't know if any of this is true but I've been forwarded \"images\" of the \"repainted\" paintings and so far what I've seen doesn't faze me in the least. I mean, how am I suppose to react? My \"couldn't care less\" position is the only one I can come up with. I'm so tired of what has surrounded this body of work...(the original Canal Zone paintings have been locked up for five years), the only thing I can say to anybody out there who wants to \"bandwagon\" these paintings is... \"good luck\". Seriously... why would anyone in China, or for that matter, anyone in any other country, take the time to make \"another copy\" of works that according to the courts... don't belong to me in the first place? Sure, I got a favorable ruling by three judges on appeal, but they didn't clear all the paintings. There's still \"five\" paintings that are now back with the original judge... a judge Batts... and she still has the power to tell me to go take a hike. In other words... she can still rule that these five paintings are not \"transformative\" and thus lock them up again, (throw away the \"squaresville key\") and throw a very large book at me. (Sometimes I'm not sure the straight world is tricky or just plain stupid).\nBut aren't I curious about the \"Chinese\" paintings, my anonymous friends ask? No I'm not. (I'm so far removed from the experience it's like the actual canal of The Canal Zone has been filled in with art world rubble and no longer serves as a passageway for international shipping containers. The only remnants of the colossal earthen scar is an overgrown jungle teaming with giant spiders from Mars).\nFrom what I've seen of The Banal Zone paintings they look worst than some of the paintings I originally painted. You have to understand that when I started out painting my Canal Zone paintings I had no intention of making good paintings. In fact most of them were never finished and the majority were an experiment with new painting techniques. (This is the first time I've gone on the record about this stuff). Anyway... there are a couple of Canal Zone paintings that WERE aggressive and satisfying in ways that's hard to describe... they were done quickly and under the influence of certain music I was listening to at the time... AND... very much part of a \"screen play\" I was toying around with. They started out as storyboards for a \"pitch\" called Eden Rock. (You got to start somewhere). They started off innocently enough when I found this Rasta book on vacation and I simply started to use some of the images in the book for collages. (Early on I pasted a guitar over the body of one of the Rasta's, kind of lined it up so that the Rasta looked as if he was \"wailing\" away... The simple \"contribution\" of adding the guitar generated enough of a reason to go further with the image. Not unlike when I \"added\" the \"surgical mask\" to the face of the nurse). I can't say it more simply. These things happen. There's no plan. No ulterior motive. You go with a feeling. Sometimes you just get lucky. You end up creating your own new kind of history. Wild History.\nI can't even begin to articulate what the Chinese paintings... the Banal Zone paintings mean or don't mean.\nI'd like to try to put my finger on what they represent but then I'd probably need the rest of the month to figure out exactly how they function as \"objects\" and what if any, relationship do they have with primary experience.\nI'm just going to have to let the theorists and the idea people out there figure that one out.\nI'm not Chinese.\nIn the end I have no ideas. I have no theories. What I do have and always have had, is instinct, passion, and love and the need to see something that I've never seen before. If anything... I'm always in some kind of crisis. If there's a new chimney out there that suddenly appears... I try and see what kind of smoke is smoking out the top.\n1/31/2014\nIt’s all about the last ten minutes.\nCaptain Morgan and Dunkin Donuts.\nCruise ships and desert islands.\nThe Bermuda Triangle.\nCesspools and sewage.\nGirls who don’t shave.

The Belly Of The Beast. Abbott wrote it in jail while serving time for murder. Norman Mailer thought the book, the writing, genius... and lobbied to get Abbott an early parole. Abbott got the early parole and then stabbed a waiter over what he felt was some kind of \"slight\" from the waiter. (I can't remember the details of the slight and don't remember which restaurant the stabbing took place in. Some restaurant in NYC). The waiter was an aspiring actor. I remember thinking at the time that Norman Mailer should share in the Abbott's \"new guilt\". What a fucking ass Mailer was. What was he thinking? That art trumped human life? He was up to his eyeballs in crime writing. A couple of steps behind Capote... writing Executioners Song. A fucking gas-bag liberal who didn't give a shit about the life of an innocent waiter/actor. Anyway... that's what I was thinking. I was thinking that it was Mailer who killed the waiter not Abbott. I was pissed at Mailer for getting all busy bodied about a convicted murderer who wrote a \"talented book\". An expert \"artist\" with an opinion... and the opinion was an aesthetic one...\nThis whole \"Remembering Abbott\" thing came up because of an article that just appeared this weekend in the NY Time magazine. My wife has the magazine and is doing the crossword puzzle... so when I get the mag back I'll finish my thoughts about what triggered this \"memory\". Hopefully it will touch on some of my \"views\" about why \"artists\" should stay the fuck away from people who murder. Yes it's complicated. And yes I should probably take my own advice. And yes I know about forgiveness and redemption and rehabilitation and never having a chance in life. That your marked right from the start. It's a stacked deck. Natural born killer. And that my position about people who murder is a dead-end and probably not worth shit but still... I need to what? What is it that I need to remember...That's what I need to find out...\nI'll try finding out tomorrow...\nIt's tomorrow and I still don't have the magazine. It might of gotten thrown out. According to my wife, Sunday's crossword is the hardest of the week. But basically the story I was referring to, (in the NY Times magazine section) involved an incarcerated inmate who wrote a \"detective novel\" and sent it to a publisher who was sponsoring a prize for the best \"crime story\" written by a beginner... someone who hadn't been published... someone who was a \"new voice\". The inmate had spent most of his adult life in prison for robbery, arson, and murder that he committed along with his brother when they were in their late teens, early twenties. Their plan was to rob a jewelry store and and part of their plan was to set a fire in a building a couple of blocks away so as to \"distract\" the police while they made off with \"the goods\". The plan worked except for two things... they got caught the next day and a young woman died in the building that they had set on fire. (Their \"big\" heist netted them two hundred dollars worth of women's wedding rings). The inmate and his brother pleaded guilty to avoid a death penalty and both are currently serving life sentences.\nLong story short: the inmate started working in the prison library... started reading Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett and wrote his own hard-boiled Elmore Leonard/James Elroy type of detective story.\nAccording the article in the Times the inmate found out about a small publishing house giving away prize money for a best new book based on the \"hallmarks\" of James M Cain or more currently Michael Connelly.\nAnd the winner is...\nWhen the publisher read the manuscript and awarded it the prize ... they or whoever read it had no idea that the manuscript was submitted by an inmate serving a life sentence for murder.\nThe publisher got in touch with the inmate's sister and sister got in touch with her inmate brother. The prize was his. And the book was published and has recently come out. Because of some new changes in the law the inmate gets to keep the prize money and there's even talk about maybe him getting out... in other words... his life sentence might be commuted due to these \"new developments\"... these \"new circumstances\"...\nSo what I need to find out, what I need to remember is the victim. The girl who died in the fire. The fire that was set by the inmate who planned to rob a jewelry store.\nNow... I know the inmate came from a broken home and had all kinds of bad shit happen to him when he was young. (Never had a chance). His mother beat him with a baseball bat. She was a crack or meth head. Makes no difference... she treated him like shit. The inmate had no education and could barely make a living washing dishes. His step-father was no better. In and out of foster homes... often separated from his brother and sister. He had a bad deal. I get it. I'm not ignoring \"his circumstances\". There's thousands of people who have the same bad deal and get the shit kicked out of them everyday. That's a given. It happens and will continue to happen and there's nothing anybody can do about it. But... and this is where I get confused... am I suppose to applaud the inmate for \"recovering\" and writing a \"spectacular\" work of fiction. Sure. Why not. I'm not unsympathetic. It's not like I have to treat everything black and white...But but but... there's always that fucking \"but\"...\nWhat about the victim?\nI'm not going to get fuzzy and do Norman Mailer and lobby to get this guy out of jail. That's none of my business. That's not for me to decide. I don't have the skill, the background, or the expertise to make that kind of judgement. And I'm certainly not going to stick up for the guy just because he wrote a prize winning book. (Maybe the victim's relatives should decide).\nMaybe the woman who died in the fire would have written a book. That I can talk about. The inmate \"might never of had a chance\"... there's a question there... but the woman who died in the fire CERTAINLY didn't have a chance. That's a fact. She died, she's dead, she's gone... and she didn't get to do anything in last forty years that the inmate has gotten to do. Deal? I don't think so.\nThat's my \"position\"... right or wrong. And I don't give a fuck because I know I'm right.\n1/10/2014\nNotes from Budapest...\nBeing born in the Canal Zone you are referred to as a Zonian.

Other then that, nothing. I've written about this relationship before. I think what I wrote was published in Art Forum. (You'll just have to look up what issue).\nI love and respect Warhol's work but I don't think he would of ever admit publicly that he didn't like something. If he answered at all he would probably just say, \"oh, ah.. gee, you know... I don't really know\".\nMe, on the other hand... I'm angry. And I'm not sure why. I've spent years on the couch and it gets me nowhere. I've also suddenly realized that some aspects of the social media is like having a \"giant\" psychiatrist. ( I went to see my followers.

First I have to deal with trying to get thru the next twenty years to even finish the fucker…\n1970? (I’m bad with dates)… I’m a junior in college… avoiding the draft, in Springvale Maine. The college is Nasson College… a real shit hole, mostly for losers who couldn’t get accepted anywhere else or kids who barely got out of high school and just decided not to apply to other colleges because they were too lazy to leave their neighborhood and comfort of their own bedrooms. (I'm one of the losers, not one of the local lazies)...AND I’ve discovered since I’ve been hiding out there, an amazing small art program located “off-campus” in a carriage house that I’ve managed to work my way into and make sense out of and take advantage of and help turn me onto the side effects of something that I can hardly believe... art.\nBut then this happened…\nI kind of got tripped up and found myself outside of what had become my small private art world on May 4th 1970.\nWhat tripped me up?\nKent State.\nEverybody was freaking out about the Kent State shootings. I had pretty much stayed away from any political commitment. I had grown tired of hippies protesting the war and then coming home after the protest at 4:30 in the afternoon to listen to their Neil Young albums. (Never trust a hippie).\nI didn’t give a shit about what the government was trying to put down. For me, I had already come around to thinking Gauguin’s paintings were a political statement. Painting beauty was where it was at. I mean… can anybody tell me who the president of France was when Gauguin was off painting his beautiful paintings in Tahiti? I thought so…\nBut the Kent State shootings were different. That got to me. The shootings pissed me off and I found myself wandering around the campus trying to come to terms with the murder. Nixon and Agnew were shitheads and already dead people to me. I really thought they were going to try to stage some kind of coup and take over the government. I was ready to pack it up and retreat to the upper parts of the Adirondacks… put a hold on “beauty” and work out and get in shape, stockpile supplies, turn on the ham radio, do some reconnaissance, get camouflaged and ambush, (hit and run)… and guerrilla the shit out of the republican army.\nInstead…\nAfter more wandering I found myself sitting on the stone wall that surrounded the flagpole which was planted in the middle of the campus. I’m not sure why, but I decided to lower the flag to half-mast. It was a spontaneous action. There was no thought to the gesture. It was probably just that… a gesture. A way of coping with the murdered students. I don’t know. It seemed like something that needed to be done. There was no one around and I just got up and did it. I untangled the rope that was fixed to the cleat and lowered the stars and stripes. What did I know about patriotism? The only thing I knew about flags was that Jasper Johns painted them.\nWhat happen next was surprising, maybe even bizarre. Students started coming out of their dorms and came over to the “quad” and stood there… silently. More came. In a minute or two it seemed like the whole student body showed up. It was like a congregation standing still with heads bowed down. I half expected them to get down on their knees and start praying. What was it I had just done?\nThe campus police showed up and then the real police. Officials from the administration arrived. The president of the college was called. (“The vice-presidents gone mad. When? Last night. Where? Downtown. Gee, that’s to bad”… Just so you know that’s not me, that’s Dylan from the Basement Tapes)\nThe police asked who lowered the flag. I said, “I did”. (I wasn’t fingered, I volunteered the information).\nI was told to “come with us”.\nI was escorted to the president’s office and questioned by the president himself.\nHe seemed like the kind of guy that would rather be off campus somewhere doing anything but running the day to day affairs of a college. He was the definition of a dick.\nThis was a “hassle” for him. What I did was apparently confusing to him. I don’t think anybody knew if what I did was exactly against the law. But what I did wasn’t something I was told I should “get away with”.\nThe taking over of “our flag” was against the rules. And if it wasn’t it should be. “Private property.” “Off-limits”…”Son, there are some things you just don’t touch.”\nHe was struggling to make me see that what I did was something that I shouldn’t have done. His struggle was useless. What I had done had nothing to do with his “god and country”. I could give a shit about his god, his country.\nHe asked me again why I did it.\nI sat there, silent.\nHe spoke.\n“Don’t you know that a flag at half mast means honoring the dead.” “It fucking stands for something”. (I don’t know if he used the word “fucking”…but he was clearly upset and was trying to rattle me with his outrage). He started babbling on about the “state of affairs”.\n“dignity” and “national mourning”.\nI wanted to say your talking to the wrong guy about “regulations” “respect” and “good government bullshit”…but I kept my mouth shut. I should of quoted Marcel Duchamp… “Can one make art that is not a work of art”? I should have buzzed him with some jive and rap from Lord Buckley… messed his mind and shined his eyes… but I was way to new and uniformed to think about “indifference” or be defined as “meta-ironic”. (Shit… I don’t think I even knew who Duchamp or Lord Buckley was).\nI just wanted to split and get my ass out of the big wooden chair they had me sitting in and get back to the art studio and disappear and blend in.\nInstead I was hauled down to the Sanford police station, arrested, fingerprinted, and had my mug shot taken. I was put in a jail cell with other scumbags, lowlifes and wankers. I tried to keep my chin up. I kept singing to myself the lyrics to Arlo Guthrie’s Alice’s Restaurant. (“You can get anything you want at Alice’s Restaurant”).\nMy arrest warrant stated that I had “interfered with government property”. In other words they didn’t know what the fuck I did.\nWhile in custody I heard from one of the police officers that the campus was on “lockdown” and that there were a “good number” of students trashing their dorm rooms.\n“There’s a riot going on”.\nI was being referred to as “the ring leader”.\nIs this some kind of joke?\nThat’s what went thru my mind.\nI didn’t want to lead anything.\n(Even back then collaboration gave me a stomachache. I was a loner. Anti-social. To me that Three Dog Night song about the “number one” being lonely was wrong.\nI made bail and scrammed. I didn’t even make it back to the parking lot of the campus. I avoided any applause and pats on the back and made it over the border to New Hampshire and phoned an uncle who was a janitor at UNH and camped in his garage and tried to make sense of the sudden glare of the limelight.\n(Recognition can sometimes be the anti-Christ).\nNew Hampshire.\nLive Free Or Die.\nThat’s what it said on the states license plate.\n(I was thinking maybe I’d be making them soon).\nI was still pretty much shaken up by the National Guard opening up on innocent civilians who thought they had inalienable rights. The picture of the woman kneeling next to a student’s dead body with her arms and hands outstretched would soon be seared into my senses and become one of the icons of that terrible afternoon.\nWay to go Ohio.\nI needed to find a way to bring the flag all the way down.\nAll the way would mean finding my own beauty, on my own island.\nMaybe I should check out Manhattan. There’s a place there called Soho. South of Houston. I’d read about it in the magazine section of the NY Times. About how a crappy industrial neighborhood full of burned out cast iron buildings (lofts) was suddenly taken over by “squatters and creative types”. The picture accompanying the article showed two girls and a guy outside of a restaurant they “cobbled together”. The name of the restaurant they were standing in front of was called Food. That was it. Simple, direct. Almost a no name. Maybe I could start there. Go down for three months and check out all the hullabaloo… sign up under a different Uncle Sam.\nI’d have to ignore my parole and jump bail. I’d be a minor fugitive…wanted or “almost” wanted… a small time hood. But the numbers where on my side. New York was a big place… a “melting pot”… a place an artist could get lost in and start over. Take on a new identity, a fresh start, a clean slate. “I never had a penny to my name, so I changed my name”.\nSo that’s what I’ll do.\nI’ll go and paint the protest.\nWalter Dahn\nTHE DAY THE ART DIED (catalogue essay for a show of Walter's work I curated for Venus Over Manhattan that opened Sept. 12th)\nI don’t know if I can but here goes. One Two Three Four.\nHow can I describe a Walter Dahn work? Maybe by describing “96 Tears”…an early sixties song that was recorded in one take into a radio mic on a hit parade show in a radio station somewhere up in Bay City Michigan by a band that called themselves Question Mark and the Mysterians. A song every kid with a new Harmony guitar first started to play after they could finger two chords and then tried to figure out what the fuck Question Mark was singing about. Sometimes stupid shit turns into cool shit and cool shit makes you “glad all over”.\nI’m not sure when we went to Coney Island. The late 80’s? Walter wanted to shoot some super-8 so we got on the subway and took it all the way out. This was when the subway was still covered in graffiti. Walter liked American graffiti. He liked American rock ‘n’ roll too. He grew up listening to it on Armed Services Radio in Germany. On the trip out to Coney Island he carried with him a transistor radio with an attachment that he placed in his ear so he could listen to the transmission privately. It wasn’t headphones. It was a single wire that plugged into the ear. It looked like half a hearing aid. Walter was the coolest artist I knew.\nIt was the middle of winter when we went. Walking on the boardwalk was freezing. Walter had a girlfriend along. I was alone. (Walter always had a girlfriend). I was kind of the third wheel. I made believe I was Harry Lime, the Orson Wells character in the Third Man. Instead of black-marketing penicillin I had pockets full of speed. Walter shot his girlfriend and me like we were in a Roger Corman film. The closed up amusement rides and the absence of people made for interesting backgrounds. The only sound was an occasional gull, some wind and the flapping of torn pennant shaped flags that seemed like a leftover message from a scene straight out of the movie On The Beach. It was like his shooting anticipated one of his silkscreens. The girl and me were superimposed on all the different configurations of the shuttered “amusements”. The canvas covered rides and closed down games of chance on the mid-way were married onto our bodies.\nWalter had left behind his days of spray paint and used silkscreen to hurry along the process of making images. Silkscreen was a dead medium and Walter wanted to add its deadness to the way he “Americanized” found images. The final result was never large or grandiose or shouted out or called attention to itself. The results were “throw-a-ways”. “One offs”. Works that he would drop on the floor and let lay there for days at time. At the end of the month his studio floor would be carpeted with the built up softness of layered paper and canvas. It was like walking on his own homemade magic carpet ride.\nWalter didn’t need to prove to anyone that what he made was good. It didn’t matter to him what people thought. Good Bad Indifferent. Walter was a natural. Just like Howlin Wolf. Just like Junior Wells and James Cotton. Just like Buddy Guy. Just like all his American “unsung” heroes. Walter was unsung too. “Don’t matter if you know my name”, he’d say… “a piece of paper and a pencil is all I need. I can play the guitar with one string”.\nWalter’s band was named The Jewels. (He’d also played in a band called Slinky Gym School… something to do with climbing a rope…but I don’t know anything about that one). Straight ahead rock’ n roll. Hand to hand. More limitations. The band gave him a wedge. An option. Provided a release. Something physical. Another kind of sensation. Slurping guitars, messed up and tangled. A real dead-end. It wasn’t like he needed another end. The un-need was an extra layer… a “coating” that got rotated in after a day in the studio. Cologne After Dark. Jeff Beck instead of Joseph Beuys.\nNothing Fancy.\nWalter Dahn, born in Kerfeld, Germany 1954. Might have been the year Elvis walked into Sun Studios. Walter would know. He was listening to Little Walter when I was listening to Little Richard.\n“Conceptual Painter”. That’s what he called himself. Lives and works in Cologne. If Wallace Berman and Jack Smith were alive they could all hook up to a parade and make a float. Maybe it’s better not to think about what could have been… just introduce him to Ed Ruscha and screen Sunset Blvd.\nIs this really the fourth time around? Someone just reminded me I did an interview with Walter for something called The Journal of Contemporary Art. The interview was published but I’m not sure when. Never saw it. They s\n11/11/2013\nTELL ME EVERYTHING\nI went to a psychiatrist. He said, \"Tell me everything.” I did. And now he's doing my act.\nI was born in the Panama Canal Zone, August 6th 1949. The same year that George Orwell came out with his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. In 2004 I bought a copy of Orwell's novel at Christie's at the Rechler sale. What I bought was a trial \"file\" copy... probably some editor's copy, with a brown dust jacket with the title penciled on the jacket as just a date...1984. Maybe a unique copy. Hard to tell. File copies of most published books have always been altered a bit by an \"in house\" reader... many treated like a student's textbook... This copy of Nineteen Eighty-Four looked like it had a brown bag wrapped around it. Like someone was going to take it outside, sit on a stoop, tip it up, hold it to their lips, and drink down what was inside. In 1949 Big Brother was the secret word.\nSpy Vs. Spy\nI was in the Canal Zone because my parents worked for the OSS. The OSS would soon turn into the CIA. My parents were spooks. My mother told me she used to hide in people's closets. I always thought she was messing with me. Pulling my leg. I could never decide what to believe. Was she joking? (My parents kept me in a closet. For the first fifteen years of my life I thought I was a suit). Right from the beginning it was always hard to tell the truth.\nFrom Russia With Love\nI remember a house on stilts. A sidewalk. Really stiff grass. (It hurt when I crawled on it). And bugs. Big bugs. If one got in a shoe, the shoe would move across the room. There's not much else unless I watch the home movies my father use to shoot. I'm not sure if you can remember anything before you're five. Maybe even six. I know I don't. If I didn't have those home movies I wouldn't believe I was from Panama. In one of the movies there's a guy called Uncle Ian. He's holding a long silver stem with a cigarette attached to the end. Turns out that Uncle Ian was Ian Fleming. The creator of James Bond. My mother says she knew him from her time working for Joseph Kennedy in London just after World War Two. They reconnected in Jamaica where Fleming owned a large property called Golden Eye. I was at the \"Eye\" when I was four. If I try to regress there's something about being underwater. The memory of the \"being\" isn't really clear. Maybe this is where I get my attachment for desert island cartoons. Fleming's first book Casino Royale was published in 1952. It's hard to find in decent condition. A fine copy goes for four figures. I've got an inscribed copy to Alan Turing. The guy who helped break the enigma code and enable the British Navy to keep up with the whereabouts of Nazi submarines. When books are inscribed to friends or family, fellow authors or well known people... they're called \"association\" copies. There are degrees of associations. If you got the one that's inscribed to the person the book is dedicated to... you've got the top, the best, the one and only. To the mother or father, son, daughter... the second best. Premium association copies are what book collectors are after. I like to think of my Casino Royale copy as something that might or might not exist. You've heard about it, but you don't believe it. I mean really... from Ian Fleming to guy who broke the enigma code...?\nCitizen Kane\nAmericans who were born in Panama are called Zonians. To be described this way is like the word itself... other worldly. Sometimes when people ask me where I'm from I say... \"Not from anywhere really.” Then they say, \"What...born in a balloon\"?\nFenway Park\nIn 1954 we moved to Braintree, Mass. To a development built by the Campenelli Brothers. Peach was the name of the street. It was a dirt road and it was a dead-end. There were around thirty houses pretty much looking all the same. Single story, three and four bedrooms, living room and fireplace... separate dining room, shiny new kitchen. Lots of Formica, a new finishing surface that was something between wood and plastic. The selling point was the \"den.\" Never the library, always the den. A finished basement and a two car garage that for many of these \"stylized ranchers\" was never really completed. When most of these \"add-ons\" got finished they were customized by the husbands. A lot of them turned into mini-social clubs. The electric door could be opened by a new \"fangled\" appliance called a \"remote.\" (Husbands would always be showing you their remote). Wet bars and lawn chairs and a new kind of carpeting called \"astro-turf\" decorated these outside additions. The \"guys\" would sit around Saturday afternoons and drink beer and talk about baseball. Always the Redsox. Mostly about Jimmy Piersall. The new right fielder. He was different. Strange. He was described as \"off.\" Unstable was another description. He once hit a home run and went to third base, then second, then first, then home. In other words, he ran around the bases backwards. He went the \"wrong-way.\" He was my favorite player. The first \"celebrity\" that acted unconnected and went out of his way to make-up his own rules. As a ballplayer he only lasted a couple of years and then when he left, checked into a mental hospital. They put him in a straight-jacket. When he came out he worked for the big super market Stop & Shop. He was some kind of executive promoting products like marshmallows, cool whip, and margarine. Products from \"outer space.\" They called them \"substitutes.\" My mother ended up working for his company as a food demonstrator. She would dress up like June Cleaver and stand behind a little folding table and try to hand you a piece of beef jerky. She always kept Kool-aid in small paper cups... \"doctor's\" cups... just in case you didn't like the taste and flavors of what she was trying to demonstrate. She said the \"refreshment\" was her contribution, her \"brain child\" to the job. Okay. If that's what you say. I just turned six so it's not like I'm in a position to beg and differ and congratulate. (What the fuck do I know about \"contribution\"). I always thought the fact that she ended up working for Jimmy Piersall bizarre, troubling, but at the same time par for the course. (I think uncanny would be a good description, but I don't think I would of known what inexplicable meant back then).\nMy mother didn't believe in psychiatry. She didn't believe in medicine in general. She dabbled in Christian Science. And was a follower of Mary Baker Eddy. (Mary turns out was the one needing institutionalizing). My mother and Jimmy Piersall. Perfect sense when you're a kid. Later Hollywood would make a movie about Piersall's life. \"Fear Strikes Out.\" It starred Tony Perkins. Tony Perkins would later play the lead in the movie Psycho. In the end of that movie when he appears at the top of the stairs dressed up like his dead mother... scared the shit out of everybody. Perkins playing Piersall. My mother working for Jimmy. Perkins cross-dressing under that bird's nest of a wig. Piersall taking a lead off first base and turning around to face right field, his ass to the pitcher. My mother handing out dosages of Kool-Aid and Lemon Fizz. See where I'm going? And this started happing to me when I was six when everything was brand new.\nSister Ray\nWe had a sister. Susan. I say we, because my mother had seven miscarriages and never let us forget them. One actually died in her womb and she had to bring it to term and then bury it. My mother had lost her mother when her mother had my uncle Bob. My mother was twelve when this happened and she basically raised her brother. My mother never let us forget this either. I think losing her mother when she was a pre-teen turned her cold, bitter, distant. When I paint that joke about the guy asking his mother to please pass the butter and instead he says \"you fucking bitch you ruined my life\"... the expression of that joke when I paint it, is part of the reality of our relationship. It's no joke. The \"ruin\" part is the amount of guilt I have. I feel like I owe her. What do I owe her? I owe her seven babies.\n\"When I was just a young boy.\"\nSome of the things that stand out about Peach Street. The road was dirt. That's how new the development was. Our first dog was run over and we buried her in the backyard. The dog was new, a puppy. She was hit by an ice cream truck. The kind that comes around late on summer afternoons. There was always that ding- dong pre-school tune coming out of its loudspeaker. In 1985 I would hire a Mr. Softee and park it outside the Guggenheim and film myself getting a cone with a swirl that resembled the shape of the museum. MTV would use the footage for one of its promos. Instead of me talking I had a dog barking for my voice. My shrink at the time asked me about why I wanted to have my voice sound like a dog. I told him puppy love.\nI was sick a lot and missed most of the second and third grades. I hardly ate and had headaches and sucked my thumb so it was easy to get colds and fevers when I forgot to wash my hands and put that thumb in my mouth still dirty and covered with germs. (Germs was big word in the early fifties. The word always came at you in 3-D. They would throw it at you like a sinkerball. I would continue to suck my thumb until I was forty-two. I swear to fucking Christ. What can I say? Proud of it...The minute I stopped sucking I stopped getting colds).\nI was born with a cleft palate. A deviated septum. I'm not sure why you get them. They're called \"hair-lips.\" They're somehow associated with a German family, the Hapsburgs. They're also associated with being a hillbilly, kissing cousins, and Appalachia. I thought I looked contaminated. Like I was tested deep in Nevada at a proving ground. For a long time I felt retarded. I was never going to be Ricky Nelson. My relatives treated me like one of the Stooges. Do you ever get use to the way you look? If you have a scar that runs down your face like a river I don't think so. When there's something you hate and you can't change it, you change the hate. Eventually I would come to terms with the beautiful scar on my head. It became a censor. It stopped me from finding the spotlight. It helped keep me in the background. I would never run for class president. I would never join the Army. I would never make friends with my congressman. I would never become a Senatorial aid. I would never become an asshole.\nAnti-social, Guarded and Suspicious\nWhen I turned eight I started to pay attention to my bedroom. I use to re-arrange the furniture once a week. I once tried moving my bed and made it \"kitty-corner.\" I was always asking my mother to buy real plants and flowers instead of the plastic kind. I would vacuum the wall-to-wall carpet three times a week. I became obsessed with the pattern I could create by crisscrossing it with the vacuum so it resembled the checkerboard of an infield. We had nothing on the walls except someone else's wallpaper. One day my father hung a painting. That's what I settled for... one painting. A reproduction of an exotic yacht surrounded by an abandoned beach and palm trees. This would be the only picture to hang in any of our houses. It was purchased in Panama and it moved with us each time my father would change jobs. Even today I know where this painting is. It's completely worthless except that it's probably the painting that I know and love and hate the most.\nI never had a penny to my name, so I changed my name.\nMy mother and father were impossible with money. It's not like they really had any. They were always siting the effects of the \"great depression.\" I always got the \"when I was a boy\" speech. If we spent a summer weekend out on Cape Cod we'd always stay in one of those motels that was described as a \"motor court.\" I use to beg them... \"Can we stay at one that has a pool? Please? Just once?\" Never happened. It didn't take me long to figure out that we were broke. \"You want water...go to the beach.\" That's what they would say. It would take even longer, but eventually I would figure in \"cheap\" right after the broke.\n\"They say I shot a man named Lee\nAnd took his wife to Italy\nShe inherited a million bucks\nAnd when she died it came to me\nI can't help it if I'm lucky.\"\nI painted that joke I NEVER HAD A PENNY TO MY NAME, SO I CHANGED MY NAME... in 1987, just after I moved out of the back of the 303 Gallery on Park Ave. South. I moved down to Reade St. in Tribeca and rented a loft just above an electrical supply store and got to work silk-screening my new found subject matter on paper and canvas. I used two panels stretched with canvas to stencil the \"name\" joke on... thinking that the divide or crease between the two panels when butted up against each other could function as the comma in the joke. I used disappearing ink when I silkscreened the joke. I sold the joke. The collector paid me fifteen grand. Serious coin. The joke part of the painting vanished. Just like it was supposed to. It left a white \"ghost\" behind. You could still read the joke, but the color that it had been silkscreened with, had gone \"into thin air.\"\nAt the time I had friends who were punk rockers and hip hop rappers and porn stars and they all changed their names.\nThe sale from the joke was the most money I had seen in my life. The money was good because I wasn't a rocker and I wasn't a rapper and I wasn't a porn star. And yes, you guessed it...I kept my name.\nJohnny Sheffield, boy Tarzan\nOne winter on Peach Street we had a chimney fire. Shitty construction. Half of our house burned down. There was always some kind of break down in the houses in our development. Foundations cracked. Siding turned green. Cesspools overflowed. Appliances shorted out. Basements filled with water. Windowpanes turned pink. Strange stuff. Suburban stuff. A lot of the lawns were seeded with chemicals. Sometimes I think Peach Street is where cancer was introduced. Anyway our fire...\nMy grandfather, in the town over, in Milton, was the retired chief of the fire department. He lived in the back of the fire station in a red house. When there was a fire in his neighborhood, his area, his \"vicinity\"... bells would go off in his kitchen and tell him the exact address of where the fire was. That's how he knew and that's why he showed up that night at our house on Peach Street. His kitchen bells told him.\nAfter he retired he got old fast and lost his hearing and spent most of his time playing with the rabbit ears on top of his television, trying to get the snow and fuzz to mix into a resemblance of an image. He was the first one in our family to have a T.V. Small screen in a big piece of furniture. There might have been a \"hi-fi\" in there somewhere too. He introduced me to Milton Berle, Ernie Kovacs, Sid Caesar, and Lucille Ball.\nI could never figure out if he liked me. He seemed to think I might have been a \"love child.\" Out of wedlock. A bastard. He kidded my father... always kidding... \"Hey Lou... you sure Ricardo there isn't your bosses son?”\nOne night we were watching The Tonight Show with Jack Parr... And one of Parr's guests was Jonathan Winters. Parr asked Winters about his childhood and Winters said, \"Why Jack... don't you know... I'm a legitimate bastard.\" My grandfather looked at me and said, \"What did he say?\" I said to my grandfather... I said, \"Winters knows dad's boss.\"\nThe smiling T.V.\nOkay, so that part about me saying Winters knows dad's boss I made up. (I never said this is a fucking 'memoir').\nBack then I couldn't answer my grandfather's question \"what did he say?\" I didn't get Winters punchline. I didn't understand the two words... legit/bastard. And I didn't understand how the two words cancelled each other out. The \"gag\" was out of my league. Parr's reaction was the only thing I could laugh about. The way he turned and looked into the camera. He knew something. The skinny on Parr was that he was too cerebral. Not enough slapstick. A lot of his \"bits\" were \"over our heads.\" Smiles instead of guffaws. My mother would say about Parr, \"to smart for his own good.\" Parr's comedy would soon be championed by Bob Newhart and Shelley Berman. They would get popular by putting out comedy on albums. Something new back then... \"For your entertaining pleasure.\" For some reason my hard-of-hearing Grandfather would buy these new wax \"word recordings\" and play them next to the T.V. in that big piece of wood... somewhere in the hi-fi. Maybe my grandfather was the spy who loved me... (Calling uncle Ian)...Who knows, maybe my grandfather knew what Parr said all along.\nI was part of the first generation to grow up with T.V. The thing it came in was called a console. A large piece of brown wood. More wood than T.V. The screen was tiny. Black and white. Three channels. You were lucky to get one. My father's mother Teddy called it... the bad babysitter. She had no use for it. Didn't understand how it worked. Couldn't understand the concept of this \"new campfire.\" She used it as another surface for knick-knacks. She put the family photos on top of it next to a bowl of fish. I really loved Teddy. And she really loved me. She was the only relative I wanted to be with. My parents would drop me off on Saturdays. From age six to ten, maybe eleven... I spent Saturdays with Teddy. Nine in the morning. Overnight. Then picked up \"For church\" on Sunday. Teddy was all Saturday Evening Post. Right out of on of those set-ups painted by Norman Rockwell. She lived in a two family house. She was the renter. You could count on her. She behaved. She always stuck up for everything good. Jesus was her savior. And the Ten Commandments were her way of life. The only thing exciting and different about Teddy was her choice of wallpaper. It was striped. Green and white. The green was dark. Forest green. The white was cream. Half-and-half. The memory is clear. And it's clear because I loved this wallpaper. For me this addition to her interior was radical. Walls of other people's houses weren't graphic and loud. Everybody in my family hated the paper. This was the first time I became aware of aesthetic judgement. One of my aunts said the stripes looked like a prison. One cousin went so far as to suggest a movie stars pajamas. Like I said, I thought it was great and couldn't understand the umpiring. Thirty years later I'd meet up with Daniel Buren and watch him stripe a nation. His \"covering\" was Teddy all over again. I know he wasn't part of her \"set up\" but I asked him anyhow... \"How did you get so lucky\"?\nMe Tarzan, You Jane\nI wanted to be Johnny Sheffield. He played the \"boy\" in the Tarzan movies. He beat out 300 other \"boys\" for the part. He wasn't Tarzan's son and he wasn't Jane's son either. I'm not sure whose son he was. (The Priest to the Rabbi: \"You see that choir boy over there? You want to fuck him?\" Says the Rabbi, \"Fuck him out of what?\") Boy didn't take any shit from anyone. He was loyal. And he would do anything for Tarzan. The Legion of Decency wouldn't allow Jane and Tarzan to have a son since they weren't married, so the script doctors made up a story about Boy being the only survivor of a plane crash. They titled the movie... Tarzan Finds A Son. Edgar Rice Burroughs who wrote the original story Tarzan The Ape Man sued MGM for screwing around with his \"vision\". (In real life Sheffield would die from falling off a ladder while pruning a palm tree. It's true. Read the obit). Along with Dracula, Superman, Frankenstein, and King Kong... Tarzan is a key book in my collection of twentieth century first editions. It's hard to find in an unrestored dust jacket. And if you do find one your going to pay 30k. I once had a chance to buy about twenty various Tarzan books all \"warmly\" inscribed by Burroughs to his only son. (There were about fifty in the series). They were being offered by Biblioctopus out of Beverly Hills. I passed. I tried to \"cherry pick\" the Ape Man out of the twenty other titles but the seller wouldn't budge. All or nothing. This was thirty years ago. I haven't seen an inscribed Tarzan The Ape Man since.\nOne of my first erotic memories has to do with Tarzan. There was an episode where a white woman was captured and taken into a hut by natives. The natives were black and the natives in the hut were black women. There was a suggestion that the black women in the hut were getting the white women ready for some kind of unspeakable pygmy punishment machine. The white woman's body would be spread-eagled on a cross with her arms and legs tied to four different trees that were bent over and held in place with rope. When the rope was cut the trees would return to their original upright position and the force of the return would catapult the woman's severed limbs in four different directions. The dangling bloodied amputations would then be gathered up and put into a big black pot of boiling water along side the already par-boiled body of one her guides. (The guides head had been decapitated and taken to a neighboring village to be shrunk, traded, and worshiped).\nAs a viewer you didn't get to see the \"getting ready\" part in the hut. You could only imagine what the black women might be doing to prepare the white woman for sacrifice, for ceremony, to appease the bone-pointing witch doctor. The \"imagine\" part is where I filled in the blanks. My fantasy of what happened inside \"the hut” is still clear, still weird. I might sound like a \"head-case\" but my hard-on involved peanut butter. I had this idea that the black women would put the white woman on a table, naked... face up, stretched out... and then slather the creamy caramel colored sandwich spread all over her luscious curvy cleavaged body. Since I was nine years old the brand they used was Skippy. (I got a boner so bad it could only be calmed down by shoving it into a jar of the lip smacking spread). That's as far as the fantasy went. There was no marshmallow, no jelly. No tasting, no licking. No dildos, or strap-ons. No clamps, whips, or chains. There were no bodily insertions. There was some mild exploration and knowing smiles from the natives... but that was it. For the most part the fantasy was strictly kid stuff. (To be continued)\nA set of encyclopedias from A to G\nThat's what we had. An incomplete set. I remember it was from Funk And Wagnall’s. The deal was... we'd save up enough S&H Green stamps and after filling up a book, my sister and I would go to the supermarket and together with the groceries and the newly glued in stamps, a clerk would come over, add up our tab and if we bought enough food and if the book of stamps filled all the pages, we'd be given another volume from the encyclopedia company. (Whatever the grocery store was giving away we always tried to qualify). We did this seven times and then it stopped. I don't know if we changed supermarkets, changed neighborhoods, or maybe the people who were promoting the encyclopedia \"give-away changed their minds. All I know is that we never got \"H\" or any other of the nineteen letters in the set. Maybe we weren't fast enough. It's not like we didn't try. We were always telling our mother to buy more groceries so we could get more stamps. The more food you buy the more stamps you get. And the more stamps, the more free stuff. In the end what I know is that I got pretty good at knowing information if the information started with letters from A to G.\nOther than the abbreviated set of encyclopedias there was Life magazine and Reader's Digest. That was it. That's all the reading material that was in our house. There wasn't a novel, a biography, a book of essays, a dictionary. I'm not sure where I got my jones for books. It certainly didn't come from my family. None of them were readers. Not even a newspaper. When I sit in my library today I can't believe all the books I have. My library is a separate room specifically designed for my books. It's the kind of room I would dream about having when I was a kid. Floor to ceiling books, with one of those ladders that's hooked on a steel runner that glides from side to side. I love that ladder. According to my psychiatrist this dream of having a room like this has to do with wanting to be alone and keeping the outside world outside. He told me my books are insulation. Bricks and mortar. Poured concrete. It's sound proof. \"You've created your own bunker. Your own fall out shelter.\" He told me I was getting ready for the end of the world. I showed him my special copy of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451... the limited edition that's bound in asbestos. Show and tell. He asked me why that one? Why out of all my books did I bring him the Bradbury? I told him that Fahrenheit was in my head. It's one of the few books I've memorized... just in case I get kicked out. \"Kicked out of what\", he asked. \"Out of my hiding place. You see it’s just a matter of time before they start burning books again. I'm just preparing. I know my library won't protect me from the know nothing fanatics who believe in religion and ghosts\". He looked at me and nodded his head. He agreed. \"So you know it’s coming,\" I asked. \"Yes,\" he said, \"it's right around the corner.\" \"Good,\" I said. \"So let's begin... Let me be my book.\"\nMEM (MORE)\nSaturdays and Saturday nights were full of \"programs.” In the morning, game shows. And in the evenings, comedy and variety. In no particular order... What's My Line? Who Do You Trust? Truth Or Consequences. Queen For A Day. The Honey Mooners. Leave It To Beaver. Ozzie And Harriet. The Jack Benny Show. The Howdy Doody Show. The Wonderful World Of Disney. I'm not sure when I started on cartoons. Right away. The Flintstones. Yogi Bear. Rocky And Bullwinkle. Tom And Jerry. It was all great. I loved watching. There was nothing else. They were friends.\nThe Lone Ranger\nI always liked the quiet type. The guy people would underestimate. The \"lowly cook.” The cape crusader. The mild mannered office boy by day... then some kind of \"transformation.” I was obsessed with Zorro. One evening my mother returned from work and with great fanfare gave me a package of \"official\" Zorro gloves and sword. I went berserk. I'm not sure what I did to deserve the present and was completely surprised at my mother's \"soft spot.” I remember the gift was given to me in the kitchen and it was given to me without strings attached. There were no ulterior motives. She was being a mother and that night I hugged and disappeared into her completely. I made drawings of Zorro all the time. In school I would draw all over my notebook. I would start with the \"Z\" and with my head bowed down and my hand cupped around the book, slash the letter a million different ways. I would draw Zorro's mask and cape and horse. I was pretty good with pencil and paper. Drawing came naturally. God given. It wasn't a big deal. Kind of like playing the piano by ear. Drawing replaced everything that I was supposed to be learning.\nThe early episodes of Superman were another favorite. (Especially satisfying). \"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.” Who would of suspected Clark Kent to be that \"super.” George Reeves who played the part never got another chance to act after he left the series. He was typecast. Pigeonholed. A one-hit wonder. When he finally got a chance to co-star in a dramatic movie the audience laughed when he appeared on screen. By the late fifties he was playing guitar and singing folk songs in coffee houses up and down the West Coast. I once did a drawing of George Reeves. It was based on a publicity picture that his agent would send out for casting calls. I did the drawing with a number 4-H pencil on hot press darche paper. I did it in 1981. It was spot on. My thinking at the time was to do a \"portrait\" of George Reeves. Not a portrait of George Reeves playing Superman. The point of view had to do with normality. It was against the grain. I wanted to present him as he was. Not the person he was famous for. POPULARITY had nothing to do with it. I always felt bad for George. I always felt bad because he couldn't get out of what he got himself into. (Painting yourself into a corner is half the battle. How you get out is where the real story begins).\nWhen I worked for Time Life in the mid-seventies I did some research on George Reeve's death. I spent time in the library reading obits and collecting \"clippings\" from a file that Time Magazine had organized after he died. It's true he died falling out of a window. Whether he jumped or was pushed out by his girlfriend was never determined. (Supposedly the night \"he went out\" there was an argument about money between him and his girlfriend). What was determined was that he fell straight down into the ground. There was no net. No stunt double. No special effects to save him. That's what you get for getting famous. A one way ticket. When I turned ten a light went on. I said to myself, \"I think I'll go after third place... leave first for the hero.\"\nWhat Me Worry?\nBozo. Clarabell. Captain Kangaroo... No these clowns weren't part of Ringling Brothers... they each had their own T.V. show. Bozo and Clarabell were local and Captain Kangaroo was national... on in the mornings just after the Dave Garroway show. (Two cannibals eating a clown. One turns to the other and says, \"Does he taste funny to you?\"). And you wonder why there's an Insane Clown Posse.\nI was always partial to the clowning around of Alfred E. Newman. The mascot and chief icon of Mad Magazine. He was the kind of character that could grow a Hitler mustache and explain it away as an \"ironic\" mustache. In the mid-fifties getting away with it was a sensibility that could be misinterpreted as Un-American. You had to be careful when you combined humor and artistry. Mad Magazine was something I had to smuggle into our house. The congressman Charles Keating was trying to ban comic books and pornographic magazines. (It would take me another year... eleven years old... to focus on \"men's\" magazines). My parents were friends with Keating. My parents were Republican. Anti-communist. Anti-Semitic. Anti-black, hated Catholics. My father was a Mason. The kind of \"racist white folk\" that Saul Below wrote about in his novel The Victim. I was never sure what Masons did. They dressed up in funny costumes and wore strange Moroccan hats. They had secret handshakes and had meetings in \"temples.” It was an old club. Very old. Apparently going back to Egypt. The eye on top of the pyramid on the dollar bill has some Masonic meaning. \"Keep out\" instead of \"welcome home\" was all I could ever figure out. Masons wore sashes that were covered with pins and ribbons. Each pin each ribbon meant you passed some kind of test. The more tests you passed the more pins and ribbons on your sash. These Masons reminded me of boy scouts and wizards.\n(Back at my ranch). My mother would find my Mads. (I was never good at hiding things... and my sister would always rat me out anyway). My mother would incinerate my treasures and treat me like a delinquent. My sister would jump on the bandwagon and use one of her new big words and call me a \"degenerate.” My mother was the principal and my bedroom was the black board fucking jungle...\nIt was too bad too because now a Jim-mint copy of the first issue of Mad Magazine goes somewhere between two to four thousand dollars. (The what me worry Alfred E. Newman character didn't make an appearance until the fifth issue). In 2001 I paid fifteen thousand dollars for the first Zap comic. I bought it from Ken Lopez, a rare book dealer from North Hampton Mass. One of my go-to guys when I need to have my collecting habit fixed. Collector's thought I was crazy. Fifteen K? \"What are you CRAZY\"? I don't know... it's like that. Why? Hard to explain. You like it. You want it. You think it's important. For me Zap is part of the seven suns. After you fork over the cash you forget about what you paid, put on some shades, and start staring at the fucker.\nLearning how to hustle\nThe best cartoon in Mad Magazine for me was Spy Vs. Spy. The graphic was original, sophisticated, subtle, and musical. How I learned to love the bomb. It had all the Strangelove you could ask for. The Cold War never looked colder. It was a perfect \"tune\" for a paranoid population. And the story lines always spoke about current events. Things like...The Berlin Wall. It was real. You could touch it. It really was a wall. There really was a no man's land. It really did separate East from West. The barbwire at Check Point Charlie really was part of a stalemate. The Wall was the perfect architecture for pen and ink. The vibe of the cartoon? Sitting on a fence. What was true, what was false? Right and wrong hardly existed. Good and bad up for grabs. And of course for the sparring spies... musical chairs and lots of backstabbing. (In 1968 I will visit Berlin and take photographs of the Berlin Wall... but that will come later).\nI once heard that Terry Southern started writing storyboards for the strip in the early sixties. This made sense. (He got a screenplay credit on the film Dr. Strangelove). Southern wrote the erotic novel Candy under the pseudonym Maxwell Kenton and had the book published under the title Lollipop after French authorities declared the book obscene. (Candy was a send up of Voltaire's Candide). I have a 1958 copy of Candy by Maxwell Kenton published by the Olympia Press part of their Traveller's Companion Series. It's inscribed by Southern to Nelson Lyon who produced William Burroughs Dead City Radio LP. Nelson would later produce Southern's Give Me Your Hump CD. I read Candy one summer just before turning fifteen living in a tent with seven other pre-teen boys. The tent was part of a camp out on the back nine of the Hyannis Port Golf Club. We were all caddies, living there before going into the tenth grade trying to make tips to pay our own way. We'd all been dropped off at the beginning of the summer. Most of us were there because parents felt the experience of working and paying for your room and board would provide a life lesson. Discipline we were told was what we all needed. The place was run like a military camp for junior cadets. Golf was beside the point. Survival of the fittest was the way things worked.\nWe were all masturbating like mad and Candy helped get the spanking going. We took turns with the book, passing it around with a flashlight to read it under the sheets. Sometimes we would hand-job each other. Sometimes we would sit around in a circle and \"circle jerk.” Whoever could shoot their cum the farthest got an extra ten minutes with the book. By the end of the summer you could hardly open the book. The pages were glued together with so much cum. This was 1964. President Kennedy had been shot the fall before. Eighteen year olds would soon start dying in Vietnam. Bob Dylan would pick up a telecaster, plug in and go electric. And Terry Southern would help write the screenplay for what eventually became Easy Rider.\nThinking back on Nelson Lyon... he was the one who came up with the idea for the Rolling Stones LP with the zipper on the cover. Warhol liked Lyon and appreciated his eye for design and stole the concept without ever giving him credit. When Lyon later confronted Warhol, Warhol sheepishly admitted taking the idea and gave Nelson half a dozen Cow prints as payment. For me and my tent mates, we were all Lord Of The Fly boys wishing, hoping, and thinking about boning Candy Christian. Who the fuck cares that nobody can be trusted? We just wanted to collect enough of our jizz to fill the cup on the thirteenth hole, (that night)... and in the morning watch the first golfer retrieve his ball after he sunk his putt.\nEncore\nFriday afternoon right at 3pm during the sixth grade was the best part of the week. That's when I got to go home and stop thinking. I hated school. The rest of the afternoon I could sink back into my beanbag, watch Leave It To Beaver and bond with Eddie Haskell. I don't know how they let Haskell into the living rooms of boys who were trying to grow sideburns and sneak cigarettes from older brothers and sisters. It always amazed me that they didn't arrest the screenwriter or Haskell himself for acting like a snot nose, brown nose, scheming little shit. One minute polite... the next, he'd be behind your back giving you the finger. I remember when I was seventeen going to the Boston Tea Party, a rock club in Boston and going because Eric Clapton and Cream was playing. (They were the \"cream\" of the crop). Before they came out though, there was an opening act. Two guys... a drummer and base player... They started thumping and pounding their way thru Tommy James' Crimson And Clover and then proceeded to destroy the Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons hit Sherrie. They played in their underwear, had wigwams on their heads and something around their calves that looked like big black elastic bands tightly wound. Put the Mother's Of Invention, The Fugs, and The Stooges all together and you come up with these two flaming creatures. They were nasty. They drooled. They blew their noses at each other. They couldn't play for shit. They were worse then the Shags. And that's on the other side of pathetic. (The Shags... another local band out of New Hampshire. Three sisters. All plainer then the next one. Frank Zappa's favorite group).\nI didn't know shit about improv or performance and video art. And it was way to early for punk. The two creatures called themselves Eddie Haskell And The Junior. In between songs they'd recite Eddie Haskell lines from the Beaver show... The drummer to the base player... Hey Beaver... gnaw any trees down lately? Lame can't begin to describe their act. The audience threw food at them, yelling, \"get the fuck off the stage... we want Cream\". (It was like the Gong Show and they got gonged). The two \"juniors\" started eating the thrown food. Just when you thought they were ready to give up and beat it backstage, they did a complete 360 and finished us off with a twenty-minute cover of Billy Paul's Me And Mrs. Jones. The Chamber Brothers reincarnated. What just happened? I swear it was the biggest badass cover anyone had ever heard. They played like Keith Moon meets Howard Hughes meets Godzilla. What the fuck? They completely fooled us. The played us for saps. They took us all in and we fell for it. \"We don't need no stinkin badges\", said Junior. Eddie Haskell And The Junior fingered us and brought down the house.\nPink Slip\nWe moved to Weymouth Mass. when I was ten. Fifth grade. Another school. More being the new kid. More slipping on the banana peel.\nMy father lost his job and started working in the Weymouth Ship Yard. The direction was downhill. He made minimum wage, lost his government benefits and took on part-time work as an electrical engineer. Making ends meet meant Rice 'A Roni, casseroles and meatloaf. (My father never talked about why he was sacked. I was to young to understand his getting \"pushed out\" of the CIA. It wouldn't be until 1967 when he was recruited by LBJ's government to help \"defoliate\" the jungles of Vietnam that I began to get a handle on exactly what my father was up to. I always thought he was talking thru his hat. According to my mother, in the early fifties he had something to do with a program the CIA ran called MK-Ultra... a special operations division researching biological and toxic substances. This \"info\" all sounded like something out of Three Days of The Condor. I would later look up MK-Ultra and find that it also played a role in testing the effects of LSD on humans. Yikes! This was around the same time I was listening to Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds).\nClipping coupons and delivering newspapers was my job. Those S&H Green stamps I was talking about before? For us they weren't something on a painting. We were fucked. What had been a new \"streamline\" two-tone Pontiac \"88\" every September was now a 1948 a fifty dollar Ford clunker. (The shape of this ride was like driving a small Quonset hut). We were so far underground I would get the bends. No more zipadeedoodah. Describing us as Lower Middle Class would be putting a gloss on our lifestyle.\nOne thing that was cheap was gasoline. Nineteen cents a gallon. This was 1962-63. A couple of stations gave away free \"drawings\" of the N.Y. Giants football team if you filled up your tank. The Giants were my team. (There was no Patriots back then). I'd beg my father to pull into one these stations and ask him to \"filler up\" so I could get a new drawing. I started collecting them. I wanted the whole team. They were really nice pencil drawings on fairly thick paper and the way the players were illustrated was flat out impressive. It's hard to explain my attraction to them. (When I became a senior in college I was introduced to the drawings of William Bailey. They were figure studies. Delicate. Crosshatched. Lovely. I had the same reaction to Bailey as I did the Giants).\nAnd it's hard to explain why gas stations were giving away frameable reproductions of sports memorabilia. You'd have to fill up twenty-two times to get the whole team. Maybe that's why.\nAnyway, I started to hang them up in my bedroom... pinning them to the wall and arranging them like a class reunion. There was Kyle Rote. Andy Robustelli, Rosey Grear, Sam Huff, Y.A. Title, Frank Gifford. I also added a photo from Life magazine of a defeated Y.A. Title on his knees in the end zone, Helmut knocked off, blood trickling down his balled head. It was the end of his career. He had had it. Except for the baldness he looked like my father. It's funny to think about my first collection of someone else's art being free.\nThe Velvet Future\nOne of my first movie experiences changed the way I thought about where I might belong. It was a musical and the actor I loved the most in the movie was George Chakiris. The movie was West Side Story. Growing up in the suburbs I wasn't charged with city energy. Seeing a semblance of New York City on the screen opened something up. Especially the first scene, shot from above with the camera positioned in the belly of a plane or helicopter or blimp, roving along the tops of the skyscrapers and panning the grids of the streets and finally settling on a gang of kids dancing on an asphalt playground passing a basketball... leaping around like Merce Cunningham and Yvonne Rainer. Their moves, what were they... \"Choreographed?”... I had no idea. Ten minutes in and I was besotted. Dumbfounded. It was finally happening. I was so fucking happy.\nI always felt oppressed by the way I looked. (Or had to look). Part of it had to do with the \"authoritarian\" dress code dictated by my parents. Chinos, loafers, patterned button down shirts. No dungarees. No engineer boots. No turned up collars. My crew-cut hairstyle was waxed and uptight. What I really wanted was Elvis hair. A conk, ducktail, sideburns, and a can of grease up there that would help shape my couffe into a Hawaiian wave.\nIn front of West Side Story, (in front of the screen), I could see and hear and know there was something else out there. Something that wasn't next door, down the street or after school. (It would be another decade before I would pick up Adolph Huxley's The Doors Of Perception. Another decade too before I would walk into the Whiskey on Sunset Blvd. and catch a set of Jim Morrison and The Doors and know right then and there that the other side was the side I wanted to be on).So many doors.\nThe kids in West Side had sleeveless shirts. Some had light grey sweatshirts with the sleeve cut off just below the elbow. Some of them had three-inch thick black leather belts with a silver square buckle pushed over to the side of the hip. (I wouldn't find out until later this \"fashion\" of putting the buckle off to the side had its origins in practicality. It had to do with hot-rodders not wanting to scratch the paint when bent over \"souping up\" their cars).\nKed sneakers. Another accessory. Scuffed up with holes at the top of the big toe. I'd see some of this fashion later on, on other screens in other movies. Steve McQueen in the Great Escape. Mick Jagger on the Ed Sullivan Show. Maynard G. Krebs on Dobie Gillis). A wardrobe for heads.\nThe outfit I liked the best in the movie was what George Chakiris wore to the YMCA dance. He played the part of Bernardo, the gang leader of the Sharks. When he went to that dance he was \"decked out.” Black suit, purple shirt with a \"tab\" collar. Skinny black tie and Puerto Rican boots with the zipper on the inner side... the same kind James Brown would shimmy and shake on...the kind Warhol would silkscreen, the kind the Beatles would wear and later come to be called Beatle Boots. Bernardo's suit was tapered. A perfect \"V.” The pants were beltless, stove piped, and cuff-less, landing just above the heel of the boot. Where did these clothes come from? I had no clue. Nine year olds had no clues. The best I could do was a clean white t-shirt.\nSometimes I would forget I was watching a movie. A general lowering of wakefulness would come over me and I'd be transformed by the cone of light behind me and the make-believe would work its way into my brain and turn everything into a giant fantastic novel.\nI would stay in my seat after \"the end\" and watch the credits roll and wait for the costume designer's name to appear. Edith Head. My new cape crusader. By the time I moved to NYC in 1973 I would settle on a simple black suit and white shirt. I would buy as many as I could in thrift stores. The tailoring would be generic. (The lapels not too wide not too thin). The only customizing I would add, was to button the top button of the shirt. There was nothing fashionable about it. Day in day out. The same outfit. It would help me blend in. It would be my uniform. My armor.\nLittle Richard\nI've told this one before. This happened before West Side Story. I guess you could call it my \"holy shit\" story.\nI was around nine and hanging out in our basement that got turned into a playroom by my father. It was always the first thing he'd do when we moved into a new place. Take over about half the space \"down-under\" and panel the walls and tile the floor and then set up his \"ham\" radio. Being a ham radio operator was his hobby. It was a strange way to spend time. Talking into a small microphone to like-minded people you'd never meet, talking about family, jobs, and the weather. My father with his radio could reach people all over the world. He had a map up on the wall and when he made a new contact he'd stick a pin in the place where the contact was made. He must have had a couple of thousand stuck pins. Sometimes he'd get a postcard from the contact with their \"call letters\" printed on the card. He scotched taped these cards next to the map. He'd also send out a card of his own \"call\". His call letters were...W1UOH. His \"handle\" was UNCLE OBO HOW. So when he turned on his radio and start to spin the dials (like he was opening a safe), he'd lean forward and put his mouth up to the transmitter and say, \"This is W1UOH UNCLE OBO HOW\"... say it a couple of times and then ask, \"Is there anyone there?” (Think: The Man Who Fell To Earth, by Walter Tevis).\nThe kind of frequency a ham operator was on, allowed the operator to talk even when telephones were down. This frequency came in handy in case of emergency or storms. The wavelengths were up in the sky, invisible, always ready to receive and transmit. It was the kind of signal that the commander of the submarine in Nevil Shute's book On The Beach tried to hunt down. The commander and crew were stationed in Australia. They'd been a nuclear holocaust in the northern part of the hemisphere and it was only a matter of time before the fallout would drift into their part of the world. After locating the signals' origin as San Francisco, the Captain decided to sail all the way to the Golden Gate... to see if the signal might be a sign of life. Turned out the signal was coming from the pull on a window shade that was wrapped around a coke bottle that would, from time to time, settle on the kind of \"key\" that sends out dots and dashes that a finger would normally tap onto. The gizmo and the \"caught coke bottle\" were next to an open window and the fluctuations of the wind would send the shade up and down to create the effect of a human's touch. Da Dit Dit Dit. Dit Dit Da Dit. There was nothing human about it. The signal turned out to be an empty balloon. Nothing to do but return to Australia and wait to die.\nI've always thought that if one were to try to define what art was... one might refer to what the coke bottle was doing in On The Beach.\nTo the best of my knowledge my father never got any rock-n-roll on that radio of his.\nPraise The Lord\nI'm hanging out in my basement in the playroom next to the ham radio listening to my record player. When I was nine I was a huge fan of Louis Prima and his lead singer Kellie Smith. They were on the Ed Sullivan show a lot and after I'd seen them several times I saved up paper route money and bought one of their albums. I was also listening to this monster hit, Trailers For Sale Or Rent by Roger Miller. He was from Nashville, part of the Grand Ole Opry. I could never figure out how this song took over some of my afternoons. Sometime you take a detour. Either that or that's why they call them \"monster hits.”\nMy sister had some Patsy Kline, Connie Francis and Doris Day. About as far out as she got was the Everly Bothers. But she did buy this one record called Tutti Frutti by Little Richard because it was my birthday and more important she said, \"you have the same name.” A ton of bricks was how much Tutti Frutti hit me. The sheer womp of the song floored me into thinking it was from Heaven Above. Boy O Boy. I started shit'in those bricks.\nI woke up.\nAfter I stopped shrieking and wailing I found out that Little Richard was a black man. A negro. I'm not sure if I'd ever meet a black man before. And not only was he black but he wore eyeliner and lipstick and had shiny kinky hair going six inches straight up like the bride of Frankenstein. I wasn't sure who the monster was. Little Richard or me.\nHere I'm down in the basement getting high on his falsetto and I can only think... holy shit... my parents just put the kabosh on rock ‘n roller Jerry Lee Lewis for marrying his thirteen year old cousin... calling what he did \"incest\"... wagging their righteous finger from side to side like I'm suppose to know what that kind of union is... (What me worry)? I mean I'm romping around the clock calling myself Little Richard and sooner or later their going to check this routine out and raise the roof and bring the wrath and suck the spirit of my new born again choir right out from underneath my fancy dancing feet.\nBIRDTALK\n11/16/2012\nTell Me Everything\nI went to the psychiatrist and he said, \"tell me everything\". I did. And now he's doing my act.\nThat was the first joke I used to make art. That was back in 1986. I was living and working at 303 Gallery on Park Ave. South.\nThe question is this...\nAre you the psychiatrist?\nAre you the teller of the joke?\nAre you the writer of the joke?\nAre you the publisher of the joke?\nAre you the reader of the joke?\nNone of the above?\nMe, I was the artist of the joke. I wrote the joke down on an 1X14 inch piece of paper with a pencil and scotched taped it to the wall.\nThis bit of patter is an excerpt from my forthcoming novel TELL ME EVERYTHING... to be published by Fulton Ryder in 2013. In the coming months more excerpts will appear here, first... maybe even the whole thing. Maybe. I'm not sure. I don't know. What do I know?\nWhat do I know?... that's a pretty good too...\n11/15/2012\nWhere's is Jack Goldstein? (Another one of my \"question\" paintings).\nOne of the best essays I ever read on an artist is David Salle's essay on Jack Goldstein. Salle wrote it when Goldstein had a show up in Buffalo N.Y. at Hallwalls in 1978. Now there's another, (essay)... this one by Ashley Bickerton... that accompany's a small catalogue put out by Adam Lindermann for Goldstein's show at Venus Over Manhattan. The show opened last night. Lindermann's gallery is at 980 Madison... a building that I like to refer to as the Brill Building for Art and Design. Lindermann's space is warehouse like... deliberately unfinished and lit like a nightclub. (EYE.like.It).\nGoldstein's show there reminds me of nothing that I thought I remembered from when he showed at Metro Pictures in 1980. The work now looks like \"good yesterday\" and what was good yesterday is good today. (The paintings could easily hang alongside John Stezaker's early silkscreen paintings from 1982. Goldstein and Stezaker are of the same generation. John was Jack's counterpoint in London in the late seventies).\nThe first painting I saw of Jack's was in a summer \"preview\" show at Janelle Reiring's loft in Tribeca in 1979. The painting was all one color and in the middle of the painting there was a small \"right on\" representation of an astronaut falling. Falling falling and falling. It was summersaulting through a monochromatic field of colored space. The painting was magical.\nGoldstein was the reason why Metro Pictures opened. Or at least that was my impression at the time. And even though I was part of the original line up, I never really felt part of the \"family\". I knew most of the artists... Sherman, Longo, Welling, Laurie Simmons and Troy Brauntauch... but I never fit in. If I talked to Jack twice during the three years that I was there I don't remember... it might of been once. I know he didn't want anything to do with me, and he acted as though he had one thought in mind... \"how do I cross you off my list\"? He wanted the spotlight and he never got it. And you can see why... the paintings that he showed at Metro are the same paintings that are being shown at Venus Over Manhattan. Do you think it takes time? Just wait. Now is as good as time as any.\nI think what Bickerton says about Jack's position of being \"dead set against being overly 'artistic' and unnecessarily 'painterly', pretty much left him in open water... To quote Christian Metz... \"his paintings had that general lowering of wakefulness\"...\nHis barking dog, his flaming window, his records with sound tracks of cars crashing are part art history. That's what we know.\nI have a couple of his paintings in my collection. That's what I know.\nHis paintings are the fucking turtle.\nJust like that \"summersaulting astronaut\"... right on.\nThe Brill Building has just put out some more\"hit\" paintings.\n11/14/2012\nThe Deep End\n\"Hey Hey I'm a potter. And people say I potty around. But I'm to busy potting, to put anybody down\". (Last night I had a dream that I had a Monkee on my back).\nWhat does this have to do with Carl Andre?\nThe pottery everything.\nThe Monkees not so much.\nI met Lawrence Weiner in Vienna in 1985. We were both part of a group show called Wien Fluess, at the The Session. Before that I would see him at the Ocean Club on Chambers in Tribeca hugging Carl Andre. They were always glad to see each other. It seemed to me that they were truly good friends.\nLawrence was a good guy. He took me under his wing in Vienna. Introduced me around. This show was one of my first encounters with a European art scene. I was impressed with all the languages Lawrence could speak. We did a lot of sitting around in cafes smoking and drinking. The language thing came in handy. Half the time I would just have to sit there. I didn't speak shit. The next time I run into Lawrence I'm going to ask him if he's ever written a sentence about deadly kissing.\nCarl Andre didn't have wings.\nHe was full of himself and he wouldn't give me the time of day.\nIn 1972 I had just gotten back from a backpacking trip to France. I was broke. Desperate. I was staying with my mother in Braintree Mass. and she said I should go speak to her boss at Thayer Academy. (Her boss was Peter Benelli... the headmaster of Thayer. Thayer was and is a private country day school on the south shore of Boston... twenty minutes south maybe. It's where I grew up). She said go speak to Mr. Benelli and ask him for a job teaching pottery to the high school seniors.\nI didn't see much of a choice. I hated going to where my mother worked and asking for a job. I really wanted to go to New York but I needed to save up before I went. I caved. I figured I could tell Mr. Benelli... \"sure, I know how to throw a pot\"... spend a couple of semesters, stash some cash and then split and live my version of West Side Story.\nSo that's what I did. I got the job. I lied about being able to pot and I spent the first four weeks teaching the kids how to coil and fire and after school I locked the door, pulled the shades and taught myself how to throw. (It's all labor. It's awkward at first but it's like leaning how to chord a guitar. After fits and starts one day you just find yourself humming along).\nPart of the pot job was curating The Thayer Academy Art Gallery.\nBenelli's wife was friends with Carl Andre. And had already arranged for him to come and have a show. Andre had grown up in the neighboring town of Quincey.\nI took a crash course in minimalism.\nThe gallery had a total budget of three hundred dollars which we spent buying bricks for Carl Andre.\nAndre showed up in May of '73... just as I was leaving... just as I was trying to get up and go.\nHe spent three days hanging around the Thayer.\nHe'd just come from his alma mater, Andover Academy where he'd also done a show.\nHe introduced me to his parents and we all went out to lunch. It was something like Red Lobster.\nWe went to the local dump where he rummaged through a pile of scrap metal.\nHe bought several strips of steel.\nI paid for them.\nHe never used the bricks that we spent all our budget on. (I was kind of impressed by that).\nHe placed the strips of steel on the floor in grids, in patterns.\nWe went out to lunch again, just him and me and he told me about working on the railroad and reading Walt Whitman.\nHe told me how he use to go up to the Quincey Quarry's when he was a kid and sit and look at the rocks. He liked how they got configured after they were mined and abandoned.\nHe hit on my girlfriend.\nI have to say I was taken by the way he worked. That kind of \"post-studio\" way of making art was new to me. It felt liberating. You could work anywhere.\nI got to NYC late that summer. August of '73. I went there with two grand in my pocket and figured I could last three months... four tops. I got a sub-let on Prince and West Broadway for ninety a month. Outrageous. Full of roaches. And fuck me, I couldn't afford it.\nI didn't know a soul. I knew a guy across the street... Bevan Davies. Barely. I had met him in Maine thru an old teacher of mine. He had a twin brother Jordan. Identical. I couldn't tell them apart. I would go three, four days without talking to anybody. I would sleep all day, get up, do some drawing, go eat dinner at Food and then drink at the Spring St. bar. I'd come home at four in the morning and watch the one channel that was still on...\nI met Vito Acconci at that same group show in Vienna. He was good guy to. He also extended his friendship. He was a poet first then an artist. Now he's an architect.\nWhen your new it's great to meet people who are older and who have been there and are not full of shit.\nCarl Andre was full of shit. Okay... he murdered the pedestal and took sculpture off the plinth but he was still full of shit.\nNothing wrong with being full of shit.\nThose stories about working on the railroad and reading Walt Whitman sound like something I would make up. And as far as hanging out at the quarries? The only people who hung at the quarries were guys with duck tails and chopped cars and girls who put out. You had to be in a fucking gang to hang at the quarry. People who went to Andover Academy didn't hang out at the quarry.\nShe came in thru the bathroom window.\nI don't what happen to Carl Andre's wife. No one will. Lawrence Wiener says Carl didn't have anything to do with her death, and that's enough for me.\nI went on a blind date. Her name was Linda. We said over the phone we'll meet at the coffee shop. When I got to the coffee shop I thought I saw Linda. I said, \"Are you Linda\"? She said, \"Are you Richard\"? I said, \"Yes\". She said, \"I'm not Linda\".\nThe were several times when I would be walking back to my sublet alone, late at night, after last call, four in the morning, and I would run into Carl Andre. He was probably doing the same thing. It was always on West Broadway. No one around. It was amazingly peaceful. The first couple of run-ins I would stop and say. \"Hey Carl... it's me, Richard...\" He'd just stare at me in his bib-overalls and walk on by. He would look right through me... X-ray vision. The way he would stare was what bothered me the most. His eyes told me, \"I'm fucking Carl Andre and I already know the time\".\nCan I bum a cigarette? That's all I wanted.\n11/10/2012\nAfter Dark: The Family Feud meets The Dating Game meets The Newlyweds... black bars and fuzz-tone blockers optional...\nIf you're not doing anything Tuesday night December 15 try checking out my new XXX-rated game show on Showtime called \"Who Gives A Shit.\" They'll be a revolving number of hosts... Jimmy \"Dynomite\" Walker, Peter Marshall, Gabe Kaplan, Jenna Jameson... and the \"Who\" girls... Pia Zadora, Kelly Madison, and Karen Black will be doing their best Vanna White. The show will be based on tired old formulas from Who Do You Trust, Truth Or Consequences, Queen For A Day, What's My Line, and You Bet Your Life. (The Price Is Right as of this date will not be sampled. We are waiting for the rights to Password and Hollywood Squares). Kinescopes from Your Show Of Shows, The Ernie Kovacs Show and Here's Johnny have been licensed. Contestants will \"emerge\" from behind a specially designed \"canned\" curtain by John Dogg. Upon entering, they will be \"naked as a blue-jay\" and will then proceed to re-dress themselves with every correct answer. (Starting with socks and stockings). Depending on the way panelists vote, the contestants can and will be subjected to being stroked, whipped, kissed, fondled, pissed on, blown or eaten out, sucked or pinched, clamped and masturbated. (If a contestant misses three questions in a row they'll be fucked in the ass... or if they use a one time \"life-line\"...piled on by a secret guest).\n\"The Envelope Please\"\nQuestions: one example...Who was the actress who starred in the 15 min. \"smoker film\" in 1956 called Smart Alec\"? Bonus question: \"Who did this actress eventually \"date\" in 1962\"? Double bonus: \"What put her in federal prison for five years\"? Clips from Smart Alec will appear on screen while a clock's \"face\" covered with a hairy ass tick tocks away. We tried to get The Roots for the house band...but they were already booked on the Jimmy Fallon show... Later we lucked out and were able to contract Woody Woodbury for the first seven shows. We have put out \"feelers\" to Joe Franklin, Pinky Lee, Soupy Sales, and Richard Dawson to be the \"announcer\" but none have returned any of our calls. (This lack of \"return\" may be due to the fact that three out of our four \"feelers\" are dead). We hope to talk to Scotty Crane, the son of Bob Crane, and try and get him to give us the rights to his father's super 8 \"swinger\" films. We would like to use the footage from these \"home movies\" as our lead in and also as background when the credits roll. The show will be up tight and out of sight. Laugh-In meets Boogie Nights.

Prince last seen instagramming pics of himself lap dancing with John Currin's Bea Arthur.\nMemo to artists who use stencil: Check out... Sigmar Polke: We Petty Bourgeois!\nSpecifically his 1978 painting \"GDR-Emblem\". His 1971-75 painting \"Lucky Luke and His Friend\".\nWhite Paintings: Per Skarstedt... just opened yesterday...has it really been twenty years? Painted them all at 94 Reade St. Tribeca. Before Tribeca turned. I remember renting a room in my loft to Sheryl Lee who played Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks. Also rented a room to Tim Burton's first wife. (Walked into her room once and the walls were covered with whips and chains. Immediately retired my leather chaps). Spent every night eating mash potatoes and spinach at The Odeon. Blacked-out on martini's for Mother Cabrini. Had \"movie nights\" on Thursdays. Richard Flood, Larry Clark, Matthew Barney, Christopher Wool, Glenn O'Brien would bring their favorite five minutes of film or video for \"viewing pleasure\". For lunch, I once went 165 days in row there eating chicken fried rice from a Chinese take-out. I painted and silkscreened these paintings on the floor. My back got fucked up from bending over all day and I had to kill the pain with pain killers. Pain Killing Paintings.\nThese paintings have never been shown in the states. A few times in Europe. In a museum in Wolfsburg. And in Berlin at a show called Metropolis. Shows that no one remembers. Eleven \"white paintings\" were made for Documenta in 1992? (I don't know the number of the Documenta. I managed to buy back on of these painting and lent it to Skarstedt's show).\nFrancois Pinault owns the four 'white paintings' I made for Metropolis. Tall paintings. Over 15ft. I remember seeing them when he showed them in Venice at one of his Palazzo's. When I made them I had my assistant Daphne Fitzpatrick video the making. This was 1993? A couple of years ago I looked at the footage for the first time. It's either the worst documentation ever made... fuzzy, out of focus, under lit, and with sound you can hardly hear and understand... or maybe it's good... unwatchable... maybe, instead, you have to see the paintings, in person... either way, the White Paintings are art made and from and for, what I like to call, Even Lower Manhattan...\n11/8/2012\nHoward Johnson says, \"declares\" Art Forum and Frieze magazines irrelevant. \"I pick them up and I don't know what the fuck I'm reading. Frieze is especially frustrating. It's like I'm in Sharon Lockhart Anne Hamilton Bill Viola world. The soup is goo! I thought Documenta was suppose to be limited to every five years. Didn't they get the message? Rod Serling might have something to do with it... I don't know... it's like Rod The Mod is occupying the minds of the editors and sprinkled quicksand in their \"marginalia\". I wish they'd do more historical pieces. Or publish blasts from the past. Not another story about artists dipping elastic bands in paint and flicking them at gessoed canvas. Sure the ads in Art Forum are everything... but please don't take any out on me\".\nHoward Johnson will be hosting the first episode of Fulton Ryder's X-rated game show WHO GIVES A SHIT on Showtime December 16th 4am central 16pm Pacific. For more information please contact wesleysnipes@artforum.com.\n11/7/2012\nYour Jammin Me Up Here... Or... Could You Get Your Head Out Of My Ass..\nAm I suppose to me nice to people who write about me?\nThere's a guy out there, his name is Andrew Russeth or Judd Tulley or something like that... I think it's Russeth...(doesn't matter, they probably both share the same brain)... and this guy Russeth describes himself as a \"cultural observer\"... (whatever the fuck that is)... And this guy Russeth keeps thinking about me and puts out what he's thinking for anyone stupid enough to listen. (I'm probably the only one who reads his crap so it's not like I've got anything to complain about). I think Russeth also works at Metro Pictures. (Now that's creepy). Anyway... four years ago he started drooling over my Tiffany Paintings... Well \"drooling\" might not be the operative word... more like heavy breathing than drool.\nHe went on to say (after he stopped breathing), that the Tiffany Paintings were a dead end... empty... and clearly the work of an artist who had run out of ideas. MMM MMM GOOD.\nSo... I would like to continue to \"run aground\" and come up empty and instead quote, (re-bird) my friend and artist Howard Johnson when he said, \"Richard, you know better than anyone... get use to eating shit or your going starve\"\nWhich brings me to... the cliche of the \"starving artist\"... Eat shit or die! (Right after this cliche you should hear a drum roll followed by the theme song to Groucho Marx's game show You Bet Your Life...\nWhich brings me to... I'd like to extend to both Andrew Russeth and Judd Tully an invitation to appear on my new X-rated game show Who Gives A Shit... soon to appear on Showtime. (A three show deal has recently been optioned). If they would like to appear as contestants please contact Fulton Ryder at richardprince.com. They can appear separately or fuse themselves together to Vincent Price their \"easier said than done\" shit...\nFile under: \"I hadn't thought of it\"... I wonder if Manzoni ran out of ideas when he canned his own shit...\nSlappin Da Base Mahn: Tomorrow on the show... Filling in the Canal Zone. Laundering money. What happen to Noreaga? Why I can't vote. Growing up with spooks. Ham radios. W1UOH uncle oboe how. Who or what was sending out the SOS signal in the movie On The Beach?\n11/5/2012\nNo. Yes. Yes. No. Yes and no. Maybe. I don't know. I don't care.\nThat's the trouble with art. It's subjective. It's in \"the eye of the beholder\". Yea that crap. \"I know what I like\". Well Richard Prince is here to tell you... \"you don't\". You don't know shit and never will. Why can Prince say this? Let me answer this question with another question. How many Clifford Stills are hanging in living rooms between the city of New York and Chicago? One? Two? Sixteen? That's the answer. None of the above. And I don't even like Clifford Still that much. I like the \"idea\" of Still... but if you've seen one you've seen them all. And I don't even mean that. That's just another lazy-ass way of talking about art. Clifford's main problem for me is that he didn't allow any other art to appear in his immediate surroundings. Studio or house. Even beach house. All that was there was his work. Not even a fucking postcard. What was he afraid of? Sure, you might call that kind of discipline, \"focus\"... but Richard Prince calls it \"fear\".\nRichard Prince is the one to decide whether its good or not.\nIt's up to me. I don't need another badge. I am the art world. Stay out of it. Your not welcome. It's none of your business. And unless I ask you your opinion your point of view will be wrapped up in a garbage bag, put in a trash can, (with the lid solidly secured), and left out in an alley way down in Even Lower Manhattan. I don't need an audience. What I do is for me and a few. Very few.\nFranz Kline is another idea that Richard Prince likes. The paintings are great too... don't get me wrong... \"don't get me wrong\" sounds like something I should say once a week.. I fell in love with Kline after I saw one of his paintings hanging in Hugh Hefner's bedroom. Is that anyway to fall in love with art? Probably not. I never said \"Richard Prince is a genius\". (But he does have unusual feelings) I think I said that about Richard Prince somewhere in an early \"writing\"... somewhere in Why I Go To The Movies Alone... Try getting that book, the hardcover... the limited edition with a dustjacket... I beg you, if you find one please sell it back to me...I have maybe two... it's one of my publications that has its own dreams. There were 150 signed and numbered copies that were suppose to see the light of day but the publisher, Tanam Press, disappeared along with it's publisher, Arthur Cravan... Arthur was last seen dropping off Lew Welch at Pettycoat Junction near Mayberry just down the road from Don Knotts farm... where was I?\n\"Where Was I?\" (That's a phrase I should repeat every couple of months). Rain it in. Slow it down. You can coast from here. Breath... and yes, I know I misspelled \"rain\"...\nBack to Betty Kline... Hugh Hefner's bedroom was the room I wanted to live in. I wanted to live in a bedroom and never leave a house. And it would be double pleasure if the house was mine. That's why I like the idea of Hugh Hefner. He did his job in his bedroom... in his pajamas... in his robe, smoking a pipe... and looking at pictures of naked ladies all day. Wait a minute. Is that true? Is that what he did? God Damn! And he did all that with a Franz Kline hanging on his wall.\nQuestion: did Hefner invent the centerfold? And if he didn't, who did?\nOne of my first impressions of Kline was a photograph of him in his 14th St. loft staring out a front window with his foot up on the sill with a cigarette in his hand. Whatever there was in that photograph I wanted to be in...\nAnd now I'm in it and I'm not done... Before I leave two \"birds\" with one stone...\nFat Fuck Dean Valentine has recently \"blown up\". A spokesman for Valentine said his recent \"gain\" prompted the West Coast collector to declare himself a \"desert island\". Richard Prince says he will refuse to pay his docking fees.\nDave Hickey, the American art and culture critic, (sort of)... has just received the Barbara Cartland Award for his book of essays, Air Guitar. (Is that what it was? A book of essays? I don't remember reading it. That's sort of like him talking about art without having actually seen it). Anyway, he will soon be amongst those precious few to be granted exclusive rights to Barbara Cartland's Pink Collection.\nOne more \"bird\" for tomorrow... John Dogg would like to know why is Tom Wolfe taking art \"tips\" from his idiot daughter...?\n11/6/2012\nWoke Up Got Out Of Bed, Dragged A Comb Across My Head.. Thoughts on the New Social.\nI talked this morning to John Dogg about his \"gripe\" concerning Tom Wolfe's daughter. \"It wasn't a gripe\", he said. \"I'm angry\". \"Besides\", he said... maybe idiot wasn't the right word, the right description... maybe I should of said idiotic\".\nAngry... why is Dogg angry? He doesn't know. All he does know is that it's a relief to get it out. He told me he stopped going to his shrink. \"It wasn't doing any good. I can't spend the rest of my life talking about my mother\". I told him some of the best artists were \"mamma's boy's\". Cezanne. Mondrian. Warhol. His anger he said is part of the of the way he deals with his lot in life. \"It's just part of me, and I'm not going to try to ignore it or hide from it, or take it to bed with me. I want a good night's sleep and when I wake up in the morning I'm not going to turn the other cheek\". Wolfe's daughter blind sided me. Double-crossed me in an interview. She shit in my face. I know I can't even the score and shouldn't even try... I should ignore her and point a bone at her and do some secret voodoo shit to her... but this is just as good. Besides the rules have changed. The 'mediums' are here. The New Social has leveled the playing field\".\nApocalypse Now\nFour weeks ago I lost power at my place upstate. During a rainstorm. Lots of hale. Big winds. The telephone pole came down in my yard. It had been there for thirty years. I owned it. It's the only one in the yard and it's maintenance is my responsibility. We were three weeks without electricity. I don't know anything about electricity. I've probably bought sixty seventy flash lights during my lifetime. Maybe more. I've put all kinds of batteries in them and when it comes time to use them they never work. I lived upstate for fourteen years. Two thousand feet in the air. Just behind the Catskills at the end of a dead-end dirt road. During those fourteen years I've learned to live with the \"elements\". Not really my choice but you adapt and end up buying every snow removal piece of equipment known to mankind. (There's was a snowstorm on April 1st in 1998 that blanketed my yard with 38 inches of that fucking \"white rain\". I spent the morning removing the stuff riding my tractor slash plow and ended up getting sunstroke... very unpleasant... right up there with shingles and food poisoning).\nIce storms were the worst. They usually come in November. There's no snow. Just freezing rain that attaches itself to every surface in your immediate surrounding. You can't move. You stay in the house next to the wood stove and candles. Your \"landlocked\" for three days.\nYou learn about fuel. The difference between gas, diesel, propane. Generators are a luxury. You start off with one that's gas fed. It'll run up till six hours before it needs a re-fill. Pain in the ass. You can run your fridge and boiler and a couple of lights. You shut it down when you go to sleep and fire it back up in the morning. You don't want to get out of bed.\nIn January of 2001 we had thirty inches of snow on the ground and it turned unseasonably warm and it rained, so the warm temperature and down pour and melting of the snow flooded our yard and basement and our stream became a river and overflowed into our barns. One of the paintings I lost was a fairly large Meyer Viceman... I don't remember how many art works I lost that day but I mention the Viceman because the sides of the painting had already been eaten by mice.\nOne of my building got hit by lightning. Went up in smoke. The building was going to be part of the Guggenheim. Most of the art in it had been removed for re-modleing but there still several pieces installed. The lightning storm happened in August of 2006? I remember getting the phone call. \"Lightning\"? \"Are you sure someone didn't start a fire\"? (We have our share of meth labs in the area). What are the fucking chances? Sure... I know building get hit by lightning, but fire too? (Turns out the strike went right into the junction box that was located in the garage).\nI learned about\n11/7/2012\nFirst let me send out a huge FUCK YOU to Artinfo.com for \"re-blogging\" my \"blog\". This isn't a blog asshole... (I don't know what the fuck artinfo is so that's why I'm guessing singular\")... It's \"birdtalk\". And I've been \"birding\" since 1990. Check out early issues of Purple Magazine if you don't believe me. And yes, 'twitter\" stole my idea and even had the one testicle to use a \"bird\" as their icon. But did I sue them? No. And why? I don't believe in copyright. You can take, steal, use, borrow, share and \"appropriate\" any idea I have and I won't give a shit. It's a free concert and I've got plenty of ideas. (More where that came from). And why do I \"bird\"? So I can empty all the stupid crap that piles up in my head before it explodes into fingernails on a blackboard and drives me insane. (I would take drugs again but I've got a family to feed) Do I care if anybody reads this shit? Does the Pope Smoke Dope? No. For all I care, artinfo.com can fuck the horse that I rode in on and fuck the bartender too.

Put them together and you get Crosby Stills and Nash. Went to see them last night at the Beacon. They were there to perform their first album from start to finish. I'll always remember seeing that album cover. When did it come out? 1968-69? The photograph on the cover was down home. Very unrock like. I wasn't much of a fan until Neil Young joined. But I aways loved Stills and Crosby's voices. And they still have them. (I was reminded too what an amazing guitar player Stills is). \"I almost cut my hair today\". Killer song. It was great to see sixty and seventy year olds getting up and out of their seats last night and letting their freak flag fly...\n10/24/2012\nA Real Bronx Cheer... a new book by Dan Colen came out last night. The launch party was at Smalls in the West Village... a \"small\" jazz club that's literally underground. The book party was MC'd by Ron Delsner with special guests Glenn O'Brien, Stephanie Seymour, David Blaine, Uncle Dirty, and the ghost of Phillis Diller. Ron's been around show biz so long when he started out nickels were made out of wood. (rim shot) The book was published by Fulton Ryder and the event was organized Fabiola. (I'm trying to convince her to keep it single). Fulton Ryder would like to thank Dan and Ron for putting on a great show and showing us how to put our faith in good revolution.\n10/18/2012\nIt's funny to see a work of art that you've made but never shown... that you've kept behind and out of sight and then see the very same thing \"show up\" and done by another artist. And I'm not talking about a variation. I'm talking the \"same thing\". It happened to me today when I was looking at the \"outdoor\" sculpture that's accompanying FIAC spread out in the Tuileries. (I wasn't there. I was looking at the art on line) The piece was a sunken boat. A row boat. The edges were the only thing above the surface and the continuous line they made turned the shape into an erotic opening. Maybe \"opening\" is the wrong description. The outline was more of a negative and the harmony of the object and its surroundings made perfect sense. It was actually better than what I had done in one of my upstate ponds. A couple of years ago I was making a video where part of the story called for the sinking of a ship. I didn't have a ship but I had a rowboat and I basically scuttled the tiny vessel until the only thing showing were it's edges which formed a perfect cunt like shape. (I wanted to sink one of those large cruise ships and have everybody jump overboard but Shelley Wintered it so I made due with what I had). The sunken row boat stayed like that until the cold set in and the pond froze and when the Spring came and everything thawed it had disappeared into the depths and the only way you could view it was to scuba your way down to its graveyard. I was glad to see the piece in the Tuileries today. It was simply called \"Boat\". As I said a better boat. Its purpose was more abstract, more artful and straightforward. It's kind of a relief. I guess I can leave my boat in its graveyard and leave it to its own adventure.\n10/17/2012\nLast night I asked my wife how to spell the name Robert Hughes. She asked me \"why... did he say something bad about you\"? I told her yea, but that had nothing to do with what I wanted to say. \"Bad about me...that I'm use to.\" What I wanted to say was how I reacted to a text I had just read... about the fact that Robert Hughes was to be \"remembered\" at the Met tomorrow. That's exactly what the text said. She said, \"and what was your reaction?\" I told her my reaction was, and what I wanted to say was... \"Robert Hughes is to be \"forgotten\" tomorrow at the Met\". She kind of physically recoiled and said, \"that's pretty mean. Why are you even bothering to say anything? Don't you always ignore these irrelevant people?\" I said, \"yea, but this reaction about being \"forgotten\" came pretty quickly. It rings true.\" \"Yea, but even so\", she said, \"it's still mean spirited and shallow\". She said, \"didn't he write for Time magazine? I mean Time magazine... come on. They wouldn't know how to spell the word cat if you spotted them a \"c\" and an \"a\".\" \"Yea, your right\", I said, \"but it's hard to put it out of my mind. And why the Met? The fucking Met? What the fuck is that about? I don't see the Met remembering any of my dead friends.\" \"Don't go there\", she said. I said, \"Where\"? \"The Met\"? \"No\" she shouted. She shouted \"shit head\" too.

Black bra... terrorist or friend?\nTHE JET GENERATION\nOr how would they put it... Generation Jet? The process of ink jetting images on paper and canvas has been around now since the mid-eighties... maybe even sooner but I know I first came to use it when I printed a monochromatic joke painting and tried to give, (to feed) the process something that was hard to read. (Jeff Koons had used the same process a year before to print advertisements on canvas.) Back then you would farm an image out to a commercial lab and a technician would put the image thru, (scan) a commuter and the hardware would literally blow out four colors onto a chosen surface. My choice of giving the lab a monochromatic joke was deliberate. I knew the software would have problems reading the color. The results would be \"mixed\" at best. The interpretation of the mono(ness) would be off. I would get a color that was different, not the same, \"almost\" true. Fast forward now. Now you have your own printers, in your own room, and the control in your own hands. (At least you think you do.) And if you so chose to, you could use the printer, the process, the ink, as your medium. Well someone did. And that someone is now the subject of a mid-career retrospective at The Whitney Museum. The Whitney isn't open today. Tomorrow? Yea, tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow I can go over and see Wade Guyton's show. Right now he's the guy who's printing up the storm.\nBase. Basic. Base(ism).

They wouldn't let me take photos with my I-phone even though I did) And I liked the giant piece in the back room... the two part stripe piece. I think with these two pieces he gets it rolling. The printer as medium makes more sense and the fact that there's less to look at is more satisfying. I also know that the older the printer the less I like the surface of what's printed.

Frank Zapper looked like he should have a name like Zapper. He looked like the character that Muldaur's hit song was about.

Specifically, fondling the Pope's private parts and inserting rubber bands into the Pope's anus to retrieve fecal matter that was then, when removed, \"flicked\" at the Pope's heavy clerical robes. At first, the brown stains on the garments appeared random and abstract, but upon closer inspection the secretions began to take on an \"outline\" that \"articulated\" the same kind of “ghost like apparition of Christ” that some say is embedded on the Shroud of Turin. An anonymous source told me that when placed under ultraviolet light the pattern on the robes appeared to \"steam\" and emit a foul odor as if something dead had not died. The accusations against the butler, Paolo Gabriele, were set out in a 35-page indictment that for the first time also accused a second Vatican employee, Claudio Sciarpelletti, a 48 year old \"computer expert,” of aiding and abetting the crime. Previously the Vatican had said Mr. Gabriele was the only person suspected of sexual perversion. Mr. Sciarpelletti however, was described in the indictment as a \"close friend,” not an accomplice whose only role was to make sure any extra discharge from the Pope's anus and erection was saved, bottled, and dated in order that the mix of fluids from the Pope's \"back and front\" could be soaked into wafers that would be then presented and placed on the tongues of pilgrims for future communions. The Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said that the two friends described themselves as \"the immortals\"... a reference that was sympathetic to a forbidden organization of neo-Nazis based in Munich, Germany.\nBenedict could at any time pardon the two lay suspects although it was not clear if he would do so. In any event, Father Lombardi said no trial would start before late September because the tribunal is in summer recess until September 30th. The two men would most likely be prosecuted in a single trial, Father Lombardi said.\nMr. Gabriele whose tasks included serving the Pope's meals and helping the Pope select altar boys for afternoon trysts, also admitted to frigging and fellating the Pope before bedtime. According to Gabriele...\"The Pope has enormous testicles that hang in a pimply sack somewhere south of a lint filled groin. The testes are outsized to the point where the fulcrum of their seesaw would jab into my cheek like a well-delivered rabbit punch. Their movement reminded me of a pit and a pendulum. When I gulped the last squirt from the pontiffs member I would black out from the repeated blows to the side of my head. Another duty of mine was to transfer all of the Pope's pubic hair and place the curls under both of his arms. I would snip the pubes with specially blessed and wine-soaked scissors and attach the hairs with my saliva to his underarms. After they dried and fell away, I would restore them to his special pillow. It would take approximately two years of cutting and stuffing to achieve the proper fluff.”\nThe indictment, said Mr. Gabriele, had confessed to taking certain \"sensitive\" documents. The sensitivity at this time can only be guessed at, but sources close to the prosecution said at least one of the documents alluded to soiled undergarments that were used as restraints, masks, and a substitute for toilet paper.\nThe case has shaken the Vatican since January when leaked documents detailing claims of \"devilish behavior\" began appearing in Italian newspapers. In May, an Italian journalist, Gianluigi Nuzzi, published a book suggesting material based on sheaves of documents stolen from the Pope's office, highlighting the Pope's displeasure at the ways in which Jews and Arabs fornicated and procreated. Apparently, there were references to the lack of hygiene between the sexes. The derogatory term \"towel-head\" was used when describing the way the two cultures douched. There was also some misunderstanding on the Pope's part in wrapping his thoughts around a woman's cycle. He believed, it seemed, that the blood from a period was used to block light on stained glass windows. The Pope suggested this \"filtering\" of light contributed to the darkening of heaven. When asked about the report, the Pope’s only response was to chant and cheer like a monkey... the same kind of sounds favored by Italian soccer fans.\nIn May, Mr. Gabriele was arrested. At the time, he was handcuffed to the steering wheel of the Pope-Mobile located in an underground garage on Vatican grounds. Mr. Gabriele told investigators that he had taken the documents because he believed that the Pope was not adequately informed of \"evil and corruption.” That the Pope had \"gone too far\" and that he, the butler, wanted to \"expose and expunge.”\nThe former butler was said to believe that a \"shock,\" perhaps through the media, would provide a \"healthy\" way to bring the church back on the right track. In some ways, he told investigators he saw himself as an “infiltrator” acting on behalf of the Holy Spirit. Asked why he was found \"tethered\" to the steering wheel of the Pope-Mobile when arrested, Gabriele smiled and said, \"It's where the Pope would send me after I dogged his arse. He told me I would be safe there. It's bullet proof.”\nThe indictment also said that a search of Mr. Gabriele's apartment at the Vatican had unearthed items including a check for $123,000 made out to the Pope along with a golden nugget and sixteenth century translation of Virgil's \"Aeneid\". Found too, was a papier-mâché sculpture of a crucified Jesus made out of pages torn from James Joyce's Chamber Music (it's rumored that Joyce selected Chamber Music as the title for his first book of poetry after hearing a prostitute urinate in a chamber pot). When asked to explain his behavior and how he planned to respond to the charges, Mr. Gabriele told investigators that he had \"no excuse\" and only removed those items due to \"degeneration of my disorder.”\nHoward Johnson re-porting from an article based on a report that appeared in the Herald Tribune by Paola Nuvola.\n8/24/2012\nWho wrote the famous ditty Funculi-Funicula?

I remember seeing a catalogue of his \"fantastical structures\" in 1975? Anyway I loved them and the way he drew them and the fact that he retreated to his farm and built \"underground\" bunkers on his property. I loved them so much that I aped his style of drawing back in the mid-seventies and made several \"after\" Pichler drawings myself. I used hot-press drache paper and a number two-h pencil to do them. I stretched the paper with water-tape and applied a watery acrylic that would \"pebble\" on the surface of the paper. Fast forward... I just completed a small house shingled with \"vinyl\" long playing records on my own property upstate called \"Loud Song\"... It's just a simple one room structure, maybe 150 sq. ft. at most, with the most amazing views looking back at the Catskills.

Well, maybe the word \"fan\" isn't the way to describe it. Indifferent is perhaps a better description. But I have to say after seeing the HBO doc. on Marina Abromovic I was kind of bowled over by the simplicity, and all the elemental stuff in that last piece of hers she calls The Artist Is Present. I think the title is brilliant. I can't think of a better way to describe what she was doing. And what she was doing hardly anything. I liked the way she muted her performance so that the audience became the real performers. Some of the relationships between her and her \"sitters\" almost became religious. (I wonder if she thought about providing them with a day bed instead of a chair.) I've always thought that piece she did with her boyfriend Ulyee back in the seventies of just her and him standing naked in a doorway so that when and if you went thru the doorway you kind of had to step in sideways and maybe even the stepping in sideways might make you brush up against their nakedness. That piece for me is the spiral jetty of performance art. And while I'm on the subject, don't forget Valerie Export. I met her once out in L.A. I've always loved that photograph she did where she's sitting down full frontal holding a gun and has cut a hole in the crotch of her jeans exposing her vagina and a big bush of pubic hair... I mean the whole vibe of that image was so \"right on\" late sixties up against the wall motherfucker don't cry for me Patty Hearst. The way she \"electrified\" her hair in that picture kicked the ever loving jams out of the park. On an aside... Valerie's \"tits\" in a box piece is in the top ten. Just to re-aquaint... she strapped a cardbox over her chest and if you gave her something like a dollar you or a friend could put your hands in the box and, well... cop a feel. There's great footage of her walking around somewhere like Prague and having complete strangers coming up to her and fondling and holding and squeezing and basically just getting it on with breasts. (Oh and and)... before I forget one more performance piece. David Hammonds selling snow balls on St. Marks Place. I don't know what to say about that one. To good to be true? Pure? Perfect? (This \"oh and and\" could go on) Chris Burden hiding on a platform he built into the corner of a gallery in the late seventies in NYC, (I forget the gallery... it was uptown). The platform was built \"kittycorner\" and just high enough off the floor so when and if you stood in the gallery you wouldn't know he was there. I mean I was there. I remember. I was. Standing, looking up, wondering... is he there? I'm here but is he? I once did a performance piece in the late seventies. At a place on Broadway in Soho called the Gromet Theater. It was pretty lame. I put my girlfriend on a swing, naked... and I laid underneath her in a black suit and as she passed over me swinging, she would mark me with a piece of chalk. It had something to do with Jesus but exactly what I forget. Flesh? Sacrifice? Pulling a \"dater\" from a fishes mouth? As I said pretty lame. (At least the audience got to see a naked lady). Maybe that performance was why I've always been a bit ambivalent about the art form.\n7/1/2012\n\"Horsing Around\"\nThe Priest says to the Rabbi: \"See that alter boy over there?

He was an artist that was linked to Playboy Magazine and the sports world. He created a character called the Femlin for Playboy back in the late fifties that continues to appear in the publication to this day. I own one of the earliest \"studies\" of this \"character/cartoon\" and have it hanging next to a copy of Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation. (The album is signed by Gerhard Richter, whose painting appears on the cover) Neiman's work was never embraced by the art world or its critics. He didn't stand a chance. He was a stud muffin. A guy with a mustache that crossed his entire face. A bon-viant. A rake. A man about town. He was right out of central casting. I always thought if Hollywood were to cast an artist for a movie they couldn't of gone wrong casting Leroy. Neiman wore ascots and favored Nehru jackets. He was never without a cigar known as a \"charute\" (not sure of that spelling) The guy had style. Not only in the way he presented himself but, if and when you look up \"painting style\" in the dictionary, Leroy Neiman's name is part of the definition. Neiman, in an interview in 1996, said he didn't care what the critics said about his paintings. He knew he wasn't going to be part of the \"inner circle\". (What can you say when your muse is Leon Spinks) October and Art Forum were never going to put his work on their covers. The best he could hope for is a \"listing\" in Elle Decor. Neiman's paintings were a concoction from a fanciful dandy. A head-on collision of abstract expressionism and Monet's water lilies. (Monet was Neiman's favorite painter) They were done quickly, in a day, sometimes done on camera, right in front of a television audience that would burst into applause after he \"flourished\" his name and signature on the bottom right of the painting. Yes, Neiman was a showman. A master of ceremonies. Step right this way. His paintings? To me? It's simple...they're naked and they dance.\n6/13/2012\nThis coming Tuesday I have a meeting with the folks from HBO. They want to talk to me about my idea for a new game show. It's called \"Who Gives A Shit\". I think the fact that they don't have game show in their line up appeals to them. Either that or they just want milk my brain and be polite. (Humor me? I don't think so...Fuck me over and steal my first born is more like it). My pitch to them will be simple. Holograms of dead TV stars mixed in with real live celebrities. For example Bob Krane and Richard Dawson, (dead) saddled up next to Mason Williams and Jimmy Walker. I was thinking about Art Linkletter as the host, but I think he's still pissed about his kid thinking he could fly out of a ten story window when he was on LSD. (Kids say the darndest things) That's all I can tell you right now. I'd let the cat out of the bag but then I'd have to have a cat to let out of a bag. This much I can tell you. The show will be a serious mash up of Soupy Sales. Queen For A Day. Uncle Floyd. Glenn O'Brian's TV Party. And the Joe Franklin show. As they say in La La Land... \"stay up, stay hard, stay tuned\"...\n6/1/2012\nWhen Richard Brautigan was told he wrote like a sixteen year old, his reaction was \"really?\"...\nBrautigan was \"gruesomely loathed to talk critically\" but when asked to comment on the new James Jones book he said, \"terrible, everything is in there, nothing is left out.\"\nOut now... \"Jubilee Hitchhiker\", (the life and times of Richard Brautigan), by William Hjortsberg.\nAnd if you happen to come across this post Mr. Hjortsburg, I read your books Alp and Grey Matters years ago and really liked them.\n5/30/2012\nJacob Zuma, the president of Johannesburg? Cape Town? South Africa?... all three? had his portrait done by Cape Town artist Brett Murray. The painting portrayed Mr. Zuma \"in a Leninesque pose with his genitals exposed\". Mr. Zuma has four wives and more than 20 children. The artist titled his portrait of Mr. Zuma \"The Spear\". This is something that the artist Mark Flood might interested in commenting on. If he is aware of this story I would welcome his thoughts. I asked my new artist friend Howard Johnson his take on the matter and he said, and I quote... I'm still a bit puzzled over the word \"genitals\".\n(On another matter) To Russia with love: Let my Pussy Riot go!\nHenry Ford once said \"I wouldn't give you five dollars for all the modern art in the world\".\nWilliam de Kooning would spread his arms out and say, \"this is all the space I need\"....\nIs there such a thing as God Paintings?\nWhen I was growing up the Lone Ranger and Tonto were an important part of my day.\nLew Welch, the beat poet, once worked for an advertising company in Chicago in the fifties, and came up with the jingle...\"Raid kills bugs dead\"....\nIt's hard to ignore the influence of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone.\nLothar And The Hand People was one of my favorite Boston bands.\nIn 1954, Lord Buckley wrote a little book of verse called \"Hipporama\"...

I always liked the fact that Picasso grounded his work in the figure. And... when he was in his \"rose\" period, he used black and white photographs of Greek and Roman sculpture as source material for inspiration. The way the photographs would \"shade\" the features of the marble and stone figures was something that he certainly \"eyeballed\"...\nI wonder if Jack Parr and Oscar Levant were on a t.v. show today... would people watch it?\nWhat was Victor Hugo's real name?\nThe movies Blue Velvet, Bullitt, The Fast and the Furious, Drive Angry... have something in common...\nA book of my writings has just been published...

It's true. I'm not making it up. Check it out yourself if you don't believe me. He actually said that! The movie is on DVD. Painters Painting...\n5/23/2012\nI was walking by Phoebe's restaurant on the Bowery the other day and was reminded that Jeff Koons first apartment was right around the corner. I met Jeff in 1977 and visited him in that apartment. It was on the first floor, right behind the restaurant. He showed me his \"inflatable's\"... these store bought flowers that you would blow air into to make them complete. I asked him why they looked \"limp\", not fully blown up... and he said, \"I don't want to stretch them out and damage their 'newness'...\" I thought right then I was dealing with an artist I could grow up with.\nAbout a year later Jeff moved into an apartment on Fifth Ave around 18th St. I asked him how he could afford the rent and he told me he couldn't. \"All I had to do was come up with the first and last month... it will take them a year to kick me out\".\nWhen he was asked to do something in the windows at The New Museum on 14th St. he decided to show his three vacuum cleaners. New ones. These were part of a series he called \"The New\". I remember when one was accidently plugged in he told the Museum staff that they would have to buy him a \"new\" one. The one that got plugged in was \"used\". This request, (it wasn't really a request...it was a demand) caused a big stink. The New Museum didn't have much of a budget and didn't get the point. It was only plugged in for a moment they argued. The mess was cleared up when of all people my pill doctor who use to sell me \"ludes\" stepped up and made a donation... (the doctor lived right across the street from the Museum and was an early supporter) Jeff believed in the \"new\". I believed it too. To this day I think Jeff's idea of the \"new\" is the real deal.\nWhen I met Jeff he was selling subscriptions, \"memberships\" at MOMA. He use to stand in the lobby and meet and greet the \"oldies and goodies\". It kind of reminded the way the character Max Blaylock use to sell shares in the Broadway play Spring Time For Hitler in the movie The Producers. Jeff would stand there, dressed in jeans and a vest and a short sleeve shirt and a bow tie and over the bow tie he would add on a regular tie. So it was a tie over a bow tie. I did a portrait of him in 1982 with this get up, this look... He also sported a pencil thin mustache. The same one that John Waters sports. Jeff's comedy was serious.\nAfter Jeff had his first show at International With Monument in the East Village... around 1984-85, I was living at 303 Gallery, with Lisa Spellman and she got Jeff to show his basketball tanks in the gallery. The bedroom was separate from the gallery space so when I woke up during the night to go the bathroom I had to walk by the exhibition. I'll never forget walking by those basketball tanks. I had seen Jeff put them together and couldn't believe the crazy science involved and when I walked past them the light from the street lamp outside on the street cast... \"bathed\" the tanks with an other worldly glow. It made them look alive. A new form of life. Something un-nameable. The last place on earth that God didn't finish.\nI wanted to buy one of those \"tanks\", maybe the one with two balls... but I didn't have the money. I couldn't afford one. I think the \"two ball\" was thirty-five hundred dollars, ($3,550.00) I was also a bit hesitant about how I would curate such an object. It wasn't until years later, when I walked into a collector's home and saw one of Jeff's \"tanks\" with the basketball sitting on the bottom of the tank without any of the \"liquid\" holding it, suspending it in place that I realized... fuck... that's how you curate it. When you want it \"filled\"...one of Jeff's assistants will come over and fill it. Until then you can just show it off \"high and dry\". Okay I didn't have the De-Niro... but still, the opportunity knocked and all I did was piss the pot.\n5/24/2012\nOut now...

Palais de Tokyo. (the modern part) Pretty amazing. It really lays out the argument and answer, that Wool's the best painter painting. Wool did his own curating. That's probably why it's a great show. All the violent tenderness is there. To quote Herta Muller... \"you can think all kinds of things. But you can't know for sure\".\nIf I owned a small piano bar, somewhere in the Florida Keys... I'd hire Woody Woodbury to tickle the ivories. The fantasy comes from watching an old Elvis Presley movie. He's on his way to Key West when his car breaks down and instead of getting the car fixed and continuing on... he decides to stay put and set up shop right by the side of the road. I think he opened some kind of hot dog stand. He'd sell you a dog and sing you a song.\nAccording to my daughter, The Morning Benders.\n\"Is it safe?\"\nMarmottan... in the 16th, Paris.

There was a bar-bee-que for Dan on the patio. Pee Wee Herman was there. I asked him if he helped Dan tip the choppers over...\nThere's something about the basketball player Blake Griffin. It not just his dunks. Or the way he looks. It's more about the way he acts. His act is a new kind of cool. Strange cool. I don't know how to explain it. His advertisements for Ikea are weird. It's like the producer assembled him from different dead people and jump started his brain and this mesmerizing charming monster becomes your next best friend. The guy never gets rattled.\n5/15/2012\nI met Frank Geary in Hong Kong. I was there for an exhibition. I was complaining to him that I was disappointed by the way the city looked. I thought it was going to be more \"Bladerunner\". He said to me, \"you were misinformed\". The other day I passed by the building he designed on 11th Ave. and 20th St. This is one of my favorite buildings in NYC. I couldn't tell if they had removed the signs that the occupants put up on the facade, to advertise their occupancy. I had done a u-turn off of the West Side Highway and from sitting in the car couldn't get the right angle to check out if this un-warranted \"addition\" had been left up or taken down. This building is like a big piece of beautiful sculpture and shouldn't have anybody in it anyway. At least not anybody who needs to advertise themselves.\n5/12/2012 (PART II...ON THE PAINTING)\nJonathan Meese. Jules de Belincourt. Barneby Furnas. Dana Shultz. Heran Bas. Andre Butzer.

There were to many people there and I kept getting interrupted. I had just run into Adam McEwan and he told how much he liked the show. He said something like, \"every young artist should see this show then go back to their studio and quit making art for a year\". I started the show by going the wrong way, backwards I was told... I didn't know there was a forward, a beginning. I got annoyed. Luckily I had seen a Fontana uptown the day before, alone in a room, (also at Gagosian). It was the only art around. And I was the only person looking at it around. Sometimes my physical situation affects the way I feel about what I'm looking at. In any case, this Fontana made me collapse and fold in and swoon. There were four \"slashes\" on a grey background and the painting was framed in what looked to be a \"vintage\" frame. The painting was plain gorgeous and made me want to stand and stare and look. I wanted to take it back to my house and live with it.\n5/5/2012\nPraise the Lord!\nThe Holy Land Experience... part of the Trinity Broadcasting Network... what is referred to as \"Prosperity Theology\" (not bad)...\nWho loves you baby?\nJanice Crouch and her husband Paul Crouch run the world's largest Christian television network. And it's tax free. They have this \"theme\" park in Orlando Fla. (a side business)... kind of like Disneyland for people who believe in God and the Bible. Not that different from the Vatican. And it's tax free. The TBN, as it's called, is a pot-porri of Mormonism, Scientology, Christian Science, and Catholic mumbo jumbo. And it's tax free. Janice is known for wearing large bright pink wigs. (Anyone remember Tammy Faye Baker?) And the wigs are tax free. Paul and Janice live in \"his and hers\" mansions one street apart in a gated community in Newport Beach Calif. And it's tax free. People of faith gave them $93 million in 2010. And it was tax free.\nShakespearean Echoes. Non-profit practices. Excess compensation.

I told him I checked out his new catalogue and that in couple of weeks I'm going to see his show in Paris. Christopher is one of my favorite artists.

We all scream for ice cream.\n4/28/2012\n\"Everything Must Go\", a movie based on a Raymond Carver short story. Very good movie, very \"steady\". (Netflix's with the family). At the end of the movie you hear the Band playing Dylan's, \"I Shall Be Released\"... I couldn't help thinking about Levon Helm, the Band's singer and drummer. It's sad... his passing is such a loss. \"They should have never taken the very best\".\n4/27/2012\nAgain at the Frank Stella show. Did he really \"duct tape\" the edges of his \"notch\" paintings? Had a preview of the Picasso show at Gagosian. Right now it's \"out of sight...\"\nHad a visit with James Nares the other day. Went to his studio in Chelsea. His new paintings are rightfully beautiful. He's using metallic paint. I've known James for a while and I've had one of his small paintings on paper hanging in a bedroom for years. I'm not sure what happened but a light bulb went off in my head and I said to myself... you got to go visit James and really look at what he's doing. He manages to loose and find in every painting. He also showed me his new film \"Street\". Soundtrack by Thurston Moore. If you ever get a chance to see it, see it. So fucking good. It produces, (just like his paintings)... a general lowering of wakefulness...\nIf you don't know the work of Walter Dahn...don't say you don't know it.\nWent to Dan Colen's new studio in Tribeca.

But they kept hammering away. Pressing me. Trying to get me to remember what I did or didn't do thirty years ago. I told them that the \"cowboy\" in question was probably a gift. Since no one bought them thirty years ago I gave it away. I told them to leave me alone. Mind your own business. I said to one of them, \"where were you thirty years ago when I owned half a stereo\".\n4/21/2012\nDan Colen just gave me a \"Whoppie Cushion\" filled with cement. I'm not sure if I'm spelling \"whoppie\" right. But who cares? Dan removed the \"whoppie\" from the cushion. It's the cement that matters.\nA guy walks into an apartment and looks at the Warhol, the Basquiat, the Hirst, and the Prince... and says, \"that's not interesting\". I ran into the guy at a party the other night and said to him...\"I am the art world\".\n4/20/2012\nWent out to Bushwick yesterday. Spent the afternoon with Peter Hopkins. Google him and check out his artwork from the early to mid-eighties. He used to show with American Fine Arts when it was on 6th St. in the East Village. We talked about Colin Deland, (Colin use to run American Fine Arts) and how much we miss him. I had Peter up to my place upstate to repair a painting of his that I had purchased from Colin... it had been badly damaged... mice got to it... I was embarrassed to tell him... but he was cool with the crappy curating and actually did all the repairs himself. He took me to Roberta's for lunch... a great place to eat, right around the corner from his \"gallery\" that he runs out there in the far reaches of Brooklyn.\nI went back to see the Frank Stella show this morning. I know Stella talked about how he figured out the \"edges\" of his paintings. That's what concerned him the most. The edges. Me, I kept looking at the \"middle\" of his paintings. That's the place that I kept looking at. The middle. Right down the middle. The center. I'd love to talk to him about the middle of his paintings. I can't imagine that he ever would... want to talk about it... the middle... but who knows? Maybe I could take him to Roberta's out in Bushwick, have a pizza, talk about the middle...\nI'm a Knicks fan. Started watching them again two years ago. Maybe it's about being back, living in the city. Years ago I used to bet on basketball but when I found out that some of the officiating was \"tainted\", \"compromised\", \"in the bag\"... I stopped. Part of the pleasure of watching, was knowing I had money on the point spread.................. so where was I? Oh yea, the betting. I didn't like betting or watching after I found out that some of the referees were on the take. I always suspected it, but didn't know until it came out in the paper. The allegations turned me off to watching all sports. Soccer, forget it. The World Cup? Are you kidding? Completely corrupt. Anyway... when they started to put instant replay into the mix it got me interested in watching again. I've never really been able to saddle up next to any game that has a judge. That's why I like golf. Golf has two things going for it. One it's handicapped... so it provides a level playing field and two it's one of the only artificial \"make-ups\" that doesn't have some kind of official making judgment calls. It's up to the player to call a penalty... and... and this is the most important part of the game... you either put the ball in the hole or you don't. It's that simple. There's no one calling the game. And no one holding up cards with numbers on it telling you your game is a seven or a nine or even a perfect score. I know all the arguments against the game. It's boring. It takes up to much time. It's elitist. The dress code sucks. It's a game for big fat white guys. Yea, maybe some of that is true... but what most people don't know is that the game is set up perfectly for betting. Waging mucho dollars on each hole is it's best kept secret. As I said before, the game is handicapped. Doesn't matter how well you play you can play someone who shoots a seventy even though you might not be able to break one hundred. No matter how bad you play you can still bet money against a superior more seasoned player. If someone is a \"scratch\" player... (a player who shoots par... somewhere around seventy-two) and you come along and play to an average round of ninety-five... the par player will give you 18 strokes. An extra stoke on every hole. So if he shoots a four on the first hole and you shoot a five... you tie the hole. No blood. The money, the bet, roles over to the next hole. The whole reason to play the game (besides exercise) is playing for money. So, if you like to bet, if you like playing a game without an umpire, if you like to walk... who knows? Grab a hybrid, a seven iron, a wedge, a putter, and take the subway out to Pelam and walk onto one of the public links out in the Bronx... you just might find something that's down to earth and out of this world..\nFor all you cats and kiddies, (just so you know)... Iggy Pop is a \"scratch\" player... yea, that Iggy Pop!\nTalking about sports... right after Jimmy Piersall... Pumpsie Green... one of my favorite (all-time) Red Sox players.\n4/19/2010\nWent and saw the Frank Stella show at L&M. Really early paintings. 1958 to 1962. The black and aluminum paintings. These are some of my favorite paintings. Ever. I've always liked that he described the reason for the width of the \"stripe\" was because \"that's the width of my brush\". I was curious about the homemade frames that were hammered onto the sides of the canvas. I assumed that Stella put these frames on himself. I would love to talk to him about the frames. It's hard to explain how much I like the \"notch\" paintings. I've always read about these two bodies of work but had never experienced them in person. The show is right down the block from where I live. I feel privileged to be able to walk into the gallery anytime I want... spur of the moment... on my way to get a coffee..\n4/18/2012\nWhen a father in India saw his new born daughter, he started punching her. This happened last week. He punched her until she died. He punched her to death because she was a girl.\nA couple of months ago, a nineteen-year-old Egyptian girl videotaped herself nude and sent out the images of herself over the Internet. The country freaked out and demanded she be stoned to death.\nJust this past year, in Afghanistan, a woman was raped, and because of the rape, had a kid and was given the choice of either marrying her rapist or going to jail.

He has ten kids with eight different women. During a 2010 \"chat\" with the HBO behind-the-scenes football show \"Hard Knocks\", he couldn't remember the names of all his kids. Cromartie is twenty-eight years old. He is expecting identical twins, his 11th and 12th, in November.\n4/15/2012\n\"Dick carried the flashlight when we went to tape Mr. Clutter and the boy. Mr. Clutter wanted to know how his wife was, if she was all right, and I said she was fine, she was ready to go to sleep and I told him it wasn't long till the morning, and how in the morning somebody would find them, and then all of it, me and Dick and all, would seem like something they dreamed. I wasn't kidding him. I didn't want to harm the man. I thought he was a very nice gentleman. Soft-spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat\".\nThat's what I read this weekend. Capote's \"In Cold Blood\". I guess I should say I re-read it. I've read it several times. I was in Book Soup this weekend in L.A. and I ran into Wallace Berman's son Jesse who works there and we got to talking about James Ellroy and James Lee Burke and the conversation wound its way back to Capote's masterpiece. We talked about how unforgettable Robert Blake's portrayal of Perry Smith was in the movie version of \"In Cold Blood\". His greased hair. His motorcycle jacket and boots. How he formed his way into Smith's truncated body. I told Jesse my plans for maybe coming out to L.A. and doing some kind of \"After Dark\" show at one of the museums. He knew about my collection of letters from Perry Smith to Capote and Harper Lee. I told how it might be cool to zero in on Philip Dick and Jim Thompson. Put some of their letters and manuscripts in vitrines and some of my After Dark paintings on the walls. Maybe show original treatments of Thompson's \"After Dark, My Sweet\" and Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\". Put together some kind of sci-fi film noir show. Maybe get Brett Easton Ellis to write an introduction to the catalogue. (There's a great interview with Ellis in the new Paris Review).\nBefore I left the bookshop, I noticed my American Prayer book on the shelf. It was turned out and had a little \"employee recommended\" card attached to the front of the book. Jesse asked me to sign the book. I signed my name and added, \"answered prayers\" after my signature...\n4/11/2012\nIt's a Mad Mad Mad world. Went to the Modern last night to see Kraftwerk. Had never been to the museum at night. It was dark and there weren't that many people there. I brought my stepson Graham, who's twenty-one and \"really\" into electronic house music. He's turned me on to Cascade and deadmau5... (Deadmouse). When Kraftwerk came on we were told to put on three-d glasses. After a couple of minutes into the first song, I couldn't help think I was stuck in an elevator watching a lost episode of Star Trek. The whole experience was strange. I remember Kraftwerk from a video that rotated on MTV back in the mid-eighties. (On the way to the concert I mentioned to Graham a contemporary band of Kraftwerk... Devo... and talked about the funny hats and outfits they use to wear) Anyway, the outfits that Kraftwerk wore at the Modern looked like they were styled from the movie Tron. After their third song Graham and I faced each other and wondered aloud... \"Should we leave?\" On the way out we ran into George Condo. \"Leaving so soon?\" he asked. \"Yea, what about you?\" George was outside with his wife having a cigarette. George said, \"We have to go back in.\" (Taking one for the team) On the ride home, Graham talked about going to Electric Zoo this spring and I talked to him about seeing the documentary film on EDC... Electric Daisy Carnival... I talked to him about how much I liked the rave music in Larry Clark's film Kids. And Kraftwerk? I don't know... I have no idea... I mean I do, but I'd rather go off the deep end and talk about Dick Shawn's \"send-up\" of that shit head Adolph in \"Springtime For Hitler\"...\n4/8/2012\n\"Having trouble falling asleep... these hotel walls are cheap\".\nI never really listened much to Paul Simon but have had him on the turntable recently. (Always liked his song The Boxer). For the past couple of years his song American Tune has become one of my favorites. Listening to it again the other day, I was reminded that back in the summer of 1985 my girlfriend was in charge of a photo shoot with him. She had just started doing music videos and he hired her to shoot an album cover. What I remember most about it was how many photos were taken. I forget the photographer but I remember thinking after they spent eight hours shooting Mr. Simon... I remember saying to some people involved in the shoot, \"Christ, I could have taken a dozen shots and be done with it\"... This \"comment\" was not appreciated. \"Who do you think you are?\" was the reaction I got. We were out on the East End, at the beach in Wainscott, and there were like twenty assistants for the photo shoot. I was just hanging around watching... the boyfriend. I was on my high and mighty... rephotographing \"cowboys\" and \"girlfriends\" and trying to re-wire the whole way photographs could be taken. Even the hairdresser, this guy Christian, ended up hating me. According to him I was a \"piss-ant\". At the end of the day there were hundreds of rolls of film. I think Mr. Simon was a bit uptight having his portrait taken. I wish I could have pulled him aside and told him about my own method for taking a portrait, but I didn't, couldn't... I wasn't that self-possessed. (My method was simple. You, the sitter, would give me five images that you yourself already liked of yourself, had already been taken, over the years... and then I would pick the one that I liked and then I would take that pick and rephotograph it and that would be your portrait. You didn't even have to pose. It was \"fool-proof\"). Anyway, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend. She accused me of embarrassing her. Even though I knew I was right, I shut up and retreated back to the city and waited out the rest of the weekend at my local bar. A couple of months later when Mr. Simon's album came out I looked at the cover and could hardly make out his image. He and his management team had chosen a blurry outtake off of a video monitor. It figured. All that effort. All that work and energy... and for what? A portrait that didn't even show up. Just goes to show. That's what I thought. But American Tune is still a great song. And the portrait of Mr. Simon on my CD package, a re-issue, a new and \"up-to-date\" compilation, is one where he's young, \"just starting out\"... looking cool and calm and very collected.\n4/6/2012\nGetting over Rimbaud. Lucien Carr boy Aphrodite. Allen Ginsberg wanted to dedicate his poem Howl to Lucien Carr. Lucian declined. I'm going to run up to my library now and check out my copy of Howl to see if this happened...\n4/5/2012\n\"Say it ain't so\". I think Phillip Roth is one of the best American writers in the past forty years. It seems like he comes out with a book a year, and every time one comes out I look forward to reading it. So it's pretty distressing to hear that he and his lawyers sent a cease and desist order to an artist over in Brooklyn who put himself inside a plexiglass box reading from Roth's book, The Great American Novel... (apparently he's reading it \"silently\"). Another part of the performance is he's getting hit with baseball cards. (I'm picturing a kind of baseball card snow globe). It's strange, because Roth was good friends with Philip Guston up in Woodstock and hung out together, and was exposed to Guston's \"crazy\" cartoon paintings. I thought that would have been enough to sign off on any \"shenanigans\" put out by an up and coming, \"starting-out\" artist. Instead, more paper work, more depositions, more briefs, more letters, more money. Fuck it...I would have thought that some of that Woodstock vibe would have rubbed off on Roth... you know... \"It's a free concert from now on\".\n4/4/2012\nMy mother called me this past Sunday and told me she had just watched a segment on the art world on Sixty Minutes, (she's 94)...and wanted to know if I'd seen it. I told her \"no\". She said they talked about Cindy Sherman and Barbara Gladstone. (My mother has trouble seeing, but no problems hearing.) I asked if they mentioned Arthur Cravan? She said she didn't think so. Then I asked her if they talked about Walt Kuhn? \"What about Arthur Dove\" I asked. \"No, I didn't hear any of those names\". I asked her if she remembered giving me a book on Larry Rivers when I was eighteen. She said, \"Kind of\". I asked her, \"Did they at least mention Larry Rivers\"? She said, \"They talked to Larry Gagosian\". I asked her who did the reporting for Sixty Minutes. She said, \"Morley Safer\". I said, \"oh... isn't he the guy who paints watercolors of the hotel rooms where he stays when he's out on the road?\" She said, \"Yea, he's a Monday morning painter\". I said, \"Don't you mean he's a Sunday Painter\"? \"No\", she said... \"On Sundays he's on T.V.\"\nSo after thirty years of collecting books, I finally got an inscribed copy of Raymond Chandler's \"The Big Sleep\". (\"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts\"). It's a great copy, inscribed to his secretary in the year of publication. The book is in original condition with an unrestored (unsophisticated) dust jacket. When I read it again I couldn't help but think of the voice-over in the film Blade Runner. (For some reason Ridley Scott got rid of this part of the movie when he put out the director's cut...) I always thought the \"voice-over\" gave the movie a kind of social science fiction. It made the \"future\" of the movie more believable. Anyway, after re-reading The Big Sleep, \"I went to bed full of whiskey and frustration and dreamed about a man in a bloody Chinese coat who chased a naked girl with long jade earrings while I ran after them and tried to take a photograph with an empty camera\".\n4/1/2012\nWoke up, got out of bed... dragged a comb across my head... Read today about two addresses in NYC that I used to have something to do with. The first one... 437 E. 12th St. between Ave. A and First Ave... I use to live there in the late seventies, early eighties... there's an article in today's Times about the place... Seems to be on some guide's list of places to be \"pointed out\". Allen Ginsberg lived there while I was there. My friend Richard Hell still lives there. It was pretty gnarly back in 1978... living there... I remember having to run from the building to First Ave late at night if I wanted to keep from getting mugged. The other address that was talked about (in some style section) was 5 Rivington... that's the place I had my gallery in back in 1983. I called it Spiritual America. It was a storefront. I guess the place that's there now is some kind of clothing store. It says in the article they're calling place Spiritual America... The past has never been in my forehead. When I read about things that I've been inside of... it all seems like Wild History...\n3/30/2012\nRead today that the author Harry Crews passed away. When I started to read fiction, forty years ago, he was one of the first people I started reading. I especially liked his essays... \"Blood and Grits\"... he wrote a great one profiling the actor Charles Bronson... His biography \"A Childhood: The Biography of a Place\" was pretty great too... When he was a kid, he somehow he fell into a vat of boiling water... or some such shit, and was burned \"all over\"... He had a lot of \"ex's\".... ex-wife, ex-kid, ex-dog, ex-house... check out his books... \"The Gospel Singer\", \"Car\", and \"The Knockout Artist\"...\n3/29/2012\nRecommended reading: \"The Swerve\", by Stephen Greenblatt...\n3/28/2012\nJust came back from Upstate. Went up there with Mark Grojohn, (sorry about the spelling Mark)... it was nice to hang out with another artist. I'm not sure when the last time I've done that. Just him and me. Talking about stuff. I have one of his paintings hanging up in the back of my \"body shop\"... We both agreed how much we like Chris Burden.\n3/25/2012\nWent to the Met today. Saw the \"Steins Collect Matisse and Picasso\" show. Especially interested in Picasso's 1909 \"Head Of A Woman (Fernande)\"... Does that remind me of anything I asked myself?... I couldn't help thinking what the difference between collecting art and making art is...\nBefore exiting the Met, I took out my iPhone and took some self-portraits alongside some Greek and Roman sculpture.... the busts...mostly the ones that had pieces missing... the ones with missing noses and mouths... the ones that had been worn down, chipped, scarred and cracked...\nAfter lunch I went over to the Whitney. For some reason I wanted to see the biennial. I'm not sure why. Before checking it out I went up to the fifth floor. That's where they hang work that's in the permanent collection. I'm glad I did. There was a gorgeous late fifties Lee Krasner painting hanging in a room of its own. After staring, I walked down to the fourth floor and it looked like people were exercising on a huge black rubber matt that took up the entire floor. There were maybe fifteen people following the commands of a woman who was talking into a microphone... telling the fifteen people what to do. I think the fifteen people following the commands were people who had walked off the street. They kind of just \"joined in\". I've heard this type of activity in the art world is called \"relational aesthetics\"... or something like that... It felt like I was interrupting the \"relation\". I quickly got out of there. I walked down to the third floor and in the back there was a room filled with artist's junk. There seems to be a room filled with artist's junk in every biennial I've ever been to. I'm not sure why this artist's junk was there. (Don't get me wrong, I like junk... but I like it when it's in a yard). I walked around the corner and there were fifty Dana Schutz paintings on the wall. At least I think they were Schutz's paintings. (I walked by pretty fast). I skipped the second floor and went down to the lobby. What happened to the bookstore? There was none. There were some catalogues thrown out on tables that looked \"remaindered\"... what was there looked like a bake sale. I walked out of the Whitney having spent less than twenty minutes... fifteen of those standing in front of the Krasner.\n3/24/2012\nNonfiction novel... the best of both worlds...\nHats off to Sigmar Polke. He was a sexy guy. Someone should do a comic book called The Polke...\nSomeone just asked me why I collect books? I told them I'm saving up for a rainy day. They said, \"What does that mean?\" I said, \"History would be a great idea, if only it were true\".\nRecommended reading: \"Mary's Mosaic\" by Peter Janney... a book about the CIA conspiracy to murder John F.

At least that's what they looked like in her self-portrait 1976-77.\nHer \"Portrait of a Reputation\" was especially beautiful. Personal more than political. A \"fiction of the real\" was what came to mind...\nI love hairy women. I don't like it when women shave. I like it when they let their underarm hair grow and their pubic hair grow... It's the way it's suppose to be. Woodman had beautiful underarm hair.\nI wish I had met Woodman forty years ago. It would have been great to live with her for a year. She didn't save anything.

I would like to talk about photography and how it coats and pours over what's out there in front of me...\nI just had a show in Malaga... at the Picasso Museum. I always liked the fact that Picasso grounded his work in the figure. And... when he was in his \"rose\" period, he used black and white photographs of Greek and Roman sculpture as source material for inspiration. The way the photographs would \"shade\" the features of the marble and stone figures was something that he certainly \"eyeballed\"...\nI wonder if Jack Parr and Oscar Levant were on a t.v. show today... would people watch it?\nWhat was Victor Hugo's real name?\nThe movies Blue Velvet, Bullitt, The Fast and the Furious, Drive Angry... have something in common...\nA book of my writings has just been published...

The Affordable Care Act requires plans and issuers that offer dependent child coverage to make the coverage available until the adult child reaches the age of 26. Many parents and their children who worried about losing health coverage after they graduated from college no longer have to worry.\nQ2:What plans are required to extend dependent child coverage up to age 26?\nThe Affordable Care Act requires plans and issuers that offer dependent child coverage to make the coverage available until a child reaches the age of 26. Both married and unmarried children qualify for this coverage. This rule applies to all plans in the individual market and to all employer plans.\nQ3:Will young adults have to pay more for coverage or accept a different benefit package?\nAny qualified individual must be offered all of the benefit packages and cannot be required to pay more for coverage than similarly situated individuals.\nQ4:Can plans or issuers who offer dependent child coverage impose limits on who qualifies based upon financial dependency, marital status, enrollment in school, residency or other factors?\nNo. Plans and issuers that offer dependent child coverage must provide coverage until a child reaches the age of 26.\nQ5:Does the adult child have to purchase an individual policy?\nNo. Eligible adult children wishing to take advantage of the coverage up to age 26 will be included in the parents' family coverage.\nQ6:Does Medicare cover adult children in the same way that private health coverage does?\nNo. Medicare does not provide coverage for dependents. Dependents must be individually eligible in order to have Medicare coverage. This provision, therefore, does not apply to Medicare.\nQ7:Are both married and unmarried young adults covered?\nYes.\nQ8:Are plans or issuers required to provide coverage for children of children receiving the extended coverage?\nNo.\nQ9:I understand that there are tax benefits related to the extension of dependent child coverage. Can you explain these benefits?\nUnder a change in tax law included in the Affordable Care Act, the value of any employer-provided health coverage for an employee's child is excluded from the employee's income through the end of the taxable year in which the child turns 26.\nQ10:When did this tax benefit go into effect?\nThe tax benefit became effective March 30, 2010. Consequently, the exclusion applies to any coverage that is provided to an adult child from March 30, 2010 through the end of the taxable year in which the child turns 26.\nQ11:Who benefits from this tax treatment?\nThis expanded health care tax benefit applies to various workplace and retiree health plans. It also applies to self-employed individuals who qualify for the self-employed health insurance deduction on their federal income tax return.\nQ12:May employees purchase health care coverage for their adult child on a pre-tax basis through the employer's cafeteria plan, if an employer chooses to offer a cafeteria plan?\nYes. In addition to the exclusion from income of any employer contribution towards qualifying adult child coverage, employees may pay the employee portion of the health care coverage for an adult child on a pre-tax basis through the employer's cafeteria plan - a plan that allows employees to choose from a menu of tax-free benefit options and cash or taxable benefits. The IRS provided in guidance Notice 2010-38 that the cafeteria plan could be amended retroactively up until December 31, 2010 to permit these pre-tax salary reduction contributions.\nQ13:It seems like plans and insurers can terminate dependent child coverage after a child turns 26, but employers are allowed to exclude from the employee's income the value of any employer-provided health coverage through the end of the calendar year in which the child turns age 26. This is confusing.\nUnder the law, the requirement to make adult coverage available applies only until the date that the child turns 26. However, if coverage extends beyond the 26th birthday, the value of the coverage can continue to be excluded from the employee's income for the full tax year (generally the calendar year) in which the child had turned 26. For example, if a child turns 26 in March but is covered under the employer plan of his parent through December 31st (the end of most people's taxable year), the value of the health care coverage through December 31st is excluded from the employee's income for tax purposes. If the child stops coverage before December 31st, then the premiums paid by the employee up to the time the plan was stopped will be excluded from the employee's income.\nQ14: I'm a young adult currently covered on my parents' health plan. What are my options for health coverage once I reach age 26?\nOnce you reach 26 and \"age out\" of your parents' coverage, you may have several options. If you (or your spouse) are employed and that employer offers a health plan, ask whether you are eligible for coverage under that plan. Losing coverage under your parents' plan may qualify you for special enrollment in any other employer plan for which you are eligible. Special enrollment in another employer plan must be requested within 30 days of your loss of coverage.\nIf your parents' plan is sponsored by an employer with 20 or more employees, you also may be eligible to purchase temporary extended health coverage for up to 36 months under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). To elect COBRA coverage, notify your parents' employer in writing within 60 days of reaching age 26. In turn, your plan should notify you of the right to extend health care benefits under COBRA. You will have 60 days from the date the notice was sent to elect COBRA coverage. If your parents' plan is sponsored by an employer with 20 or fewer employees, you may have similar rights under State law, instead of under COBRA. You should ask your parents' employer, or your State Insurance Department if this applies, and if so, how you would request the extended coverage.\nYou may be eligible for special enrollment in individual coverage purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace. To special enroll in Marketplace coverage, you must enroll within 60 days of aging out of your plan.

Enrollees across income levels have benefitted from these tax credits.\nEnter your income, age, and family size in this calculator to estimate how much you would pay in premiums with and without the enhanced premium tax credits.\nEnter Information About Your Household\nNotes\n-\nThis calculator is intended to show you an estimate of how much you may pay for premiums with and without enhanced premium tax credits and the amount of federal financial help you may be eligible for if you buy coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. It does not provide definitive results for premium amounts. Enhanced premium tax credits are currently available through the end of 2025. Premium payments in the column “With enhanced premium tax credits” are based on subsidy caps as established in the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. Premium payments in the column “Without enhanced premium tax credits\" show what enrollees currently expect to pay for Marketplace coverage if enhanced premium tax credits are not extended, using 2026 subsidy caps provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\nPremiums for this interactive were obtained through data published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), rate filings, data received directly from state exchanges or insurance departments, and data collected from state-based exchanges by KFF researchers. The silver premium refers to the \"benchmark silver plan\" (second-lowest cost silver plan) while the bronze premium refers to the lowest-cost bronze plan in the county of the entered ZIP code. Not all plans are available in all parts of the county, so actual premiums may vary depending on plan availability. Premiums shown for the benchmark silver plan are the premium portion used for Essential Health Benefits, when this information is available. Actual premiums may be higher if plans include \"non-essential benefits\" such as dental or vision care. Financial assistance cannot be used for the non-essential benefit portion of a premium. Estimates for some families with children may vary due to additional Essential Health Benefits for children such as dental or vision care.\nThe premium is adjusted for family size and ages of those seeking coverage. The calculator does not display a tobacco surcharge. However, in some states, insurers can charge a tobacco surcharge of up to 50% of the total premium, and tax credits do not apply to the surcharge. Actual tobacco surcharges will vary by plan. Additionally, some states offer financial assistance for premium payments that are not accounted for in this tool.\n-\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThe FAQs below are intended to help you understand this Calculator. More detailed questions and answers about signing up for coverage are available on our Marketplace FAQ page.\nI am having difficulty viewing or understanding my results. What should I do?\nIt could be that you are using an older version of Microsoft Edge or Firefox. Try updating to a newer version of your web browser. Not sure which browser version you are running? Check here for Microsoft Edge or here for Firefox. If you continue to have technical problems with the Calculator after updating your browser, please contact KFF.\nPlease note that we are not able to provide individual advice or assistance understanding your results.\nDoes the calculator provide definitive results for what I will pay?\nNo. There are several additional reasons why your calculator results may differ from your actual tax credit amount or premium payment. For example, the calculator relies completely on information as you enter it, whereas the Marketplace may calculate your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to be a different amount or may verify your income against previous year’s data. Additionally, some plans may include non-essential benefits, which would not be subsidized by premium tax credits. To find out if you are eligible for financial assistance under current law and to sign up, you must contact HealthCare.gov, your state’s Health Insurance Marketplace, or Medicaid program office. States may provide additional financial support, either lowering premiums or cost sharing. These subsidies are not included in calculations.\nHow do health insurance premium tax credits work?\nPremium tax credits are financial assistance from the Federal government to help you pay for health coverage or care. The amount of assistance you get is determined by your income and family size.

How do I know what to enter for my income?\nFor information on how to calculate your household income, see here.\nWhat is Medicaid? How does it relate to financial help through the Health Insurance Marketplace?\nMedicaid is a comprehensive, free health insurance program for people with limited income. This interactive takes into account whether your state has expanded Medicaid or not and will give you an estimate of whether your household income qualifies you and your family for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), if applicable. Members of your family that are eligible for either Medicaid or CHIP are not eligible for premium tax credits in the Marketplace and would instead need to sign up for Medicaid or CHIP.\nIf I am eligible for Medicare, can I still sign up on the Marketplace?\nNo, you cannot sign up for new Marketplace coverage if you are eligible for Medicare. Most people age 65 and older are eligible for Medicare, which is the health insurance program run by the federal government. If you are eligible for Medicare, even if you do not choose to enroll in Medicare, you are not able to purchase Marketplace coverage.\nWhen using the Health Insurance Marketplace Calculator, if some members of your household are eligible for Medicare and others are not, you should enter your full household size (including those who are eligible for Medicare) in Question #4. For the following question, please enter only those family members who are signing up for Marketplace coverage (do not enter adults who are eligible for Medicare in Question #5).\nIf you are over the age of 65 but not yet eligible for Medicare due to immigration status or your work history, you may be eligible for Marketplace coverage and premium tax credits. You can use the Health Insurance Marketplace Calculator by entering your age as 64.\nWhat are my options if I have job-based health coverage?\nIn general, people who qualify for health insurance through their job are not able to get financial assistance through the Marketplaces.\nHowever, if your employer’s coverage is either unaffordable or doesn’t meet the health care law’s “minimum value” requirement, then you may be eligible for financial help to purchase through the Marketplace. Family members (spouses and children) who are eligible for employer-sponsored coverage can still qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits if the employer-sponsored coverage for the family is considered unaffordable, even if the employee has access to affordable individual coverage. Starting in 2023, the so-called “family glitch” has been fixed to allow family members in these circumstances to enroll in subsidized coverage.\nWhen using the Health Insurance Marketplace Calculator, you can answer “No” to Question #3 if your employer’s coverage is unaffordable or does not meet the minimum value requirement.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The same data sources also show the overall flow of Mexican immigrants between the two countries is at its smallest since the 1990s, mostly due to a drop in the number of Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S.\nMeasuring migration flows between Mexico and the U.S. is challenging because there are no official counts of how many Mexican immigrants enter and leave the U.S. each year. This report uses the best available government data from both countries to estimate the size of these flows. The Mexican data sources — a national household survey, and two national censuses — asked comparable questions about household members’ migration to and from Mexico over the five years previous to each survey or census date. In addition, estimates of Mexican migration to the U.S. come from U.S. Census Bureau data, adjusted for undercount, on the number of Mexican immigrants who live in the U.S. (See text box below for more details.)\nCalculating the Flow from the U.S. to Mexico\nTo calculate estimates of how many people left the U.S. for Mexico, this report uses data from the 2014 Mexican National Survey of Demographic Dynamics, or ENADID and the 2010 and 2000 Mexican decennial censuses. Each asked all respondents where they had been living five years prior to the date when the survey or census was taken. The answers to this question provide an estimated count of the number of people who moved from the U.S. to Mexico during the five years prior to the survey date. A separate question targets more recent emigrants—people who left Mexico. It asks whether anyone from the household had left for another country during the previous five years; if so, additional questions are asked about whether and when that person or people came back and their reasons for returning to Mexico.\nTo calculate estimates of how many Mexicans left Mexico for the U.S., this report also uses U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (2005-2013) and the Current Population Survey (2000-2014), both adjusted for undercount, which ask immigrants living the U.S. their country of birth and the year of their arrival in the U.S.\nThe decline in the flow of Mexican immigrants to the U.S. is due to several reasons (Passel et al, 2012). The slow recovery of the U.S. economy after the Great Recession may have made the U.S. less attractive to potential Mexican migrants and may have pushed out some Mexican immigrants as the U.S. job market deteriorated.\nIn addition, stricter enforcement of U.S. immigration laws, particularly at the U.S.-Mexico border (Rosenblum and Meissner, 2014), may have contributed to the reduction of Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. in recent years. According to one indicator, U.S. border apprehensions of Mexicans have fallen sharply, to just 230,000 in fiscal year 2014 – a level not seen since 1971 (Krogstad and Passel, 2014). At the same time, increased enforcement in the U.S. has led to an increase in the number of Mexican immigrants who have been deported from the U.S. since 2005 (U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2014).\nMexican immigrants have been at the center of one of the largest mass migrations in modern history. Between 1965 and 2015 more than 16 million Mexican immigrants migrated to the United States – more than from any other country (Pew Research Center, 2015). In 1970, fewer than 1 million Mexican immigrants lived in the U.S. By 2000, that number had grown to 9.4 million, and by 2007 it reached a peak at 12.8 million. Since then, the Mexican-born population has declined, falling to 11.7 million in 2014, as the number of new arrivals to the U.S. from Mexico declined significantly (Passel et al., 2012); meanwhile the reverse flow to Mexico from the U.S. is now higher.\nThe decline in the number of Mexican immigrants residing in the U.S. has been mostly due to a drop of more than 1 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to an estimated 5.6 million in 2014 (Passel and Cohn, 2014).\nThe View From Mexico\nThe drop in the number of Mexicans living in the U.S. also is reflected in the share of adults in Mexico who report having family or friends living in the U.S. with whom they keep in touch. In 2007, 42% of Mexican adults said they kept in contact with acquaintances living in the U.S., while today, 35% say so, according to newly released results from the Pew Research Center’s 2015 survey in Mexico.1\nAsked about their willingness to migrate to the U.S., 35% say they would move to the U.S. if they had the opportunity and means to do so, including 20% of adults in Mexico who would do so without authorization. This is unchanged from 2009 when a third of adults in Mexico said they would be willing to migrate to the U.S., and 18% said they would do it without authorization (Pew Research Center, 2009).\nRoadmap to the Report\nThis report is organized as follows. The first chapter analyzes statistics on migration between Mexico and the U.S. from data sources in both countries. The second chapter uses U.S. Census Bureau data to examine characteristics of Mexican immigrants residing in the U.S. in 1990 and 2013. The third chapter, based on a nationally representative survey of adults living in Mexico, examines trends in Mexican attitudes about life in the U.S. and future interest in migrating there, and their opinion of U.S. President Barack Obama’s executive action to expand the number of unauthorized immigrants who are allowed to stay in the U.S. legally and work temporarily. Appendix A includes a statistical portrait of Mexican immigrants, compared with all Latin American immigrants and Asian immigrants, while Appendix B explains the report’s methodology and data sources.\nIs Mexico Still the Largest Source of New Immigrants to the U.S.?\nFor decades, Mexico has been the top source of newly arrived immigrants to the U.S., but with a recent decline in the flow of new immigrants to the U.S. from Mexico, and an increase in the number of new immigrant arrivals from China and India, Mexico may no longer be the top source of U.S. immigrants. The U.S. Census Bureau recently reported that China overtook Mexico in 2013 as the leading country for new immigrants (Jensen, 2015). However, under a different measure, Mexico remains the top source of immigrants – at least for now, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data.\nEstimates of the number of newly arrived immigrants vary depending on the measure used. The Census Bureau’s analysis was based on the number of foreign-born people who said they lived outside of the U.S. in response to the American Community Survey question, “Did this person live in this house or apartment one year ago?” Using this measure for 2013, about 147,000 Chinese immigrants came to the U.S., compared with 129,000 Indian immigrants and 125,000 Mexican immigrants. (The difference between the number of Indian and Mexican immigrants is not statistically significant.)\nBy contrast, Mexico remains the world’s top source of newly arrived immigrants to the U.S. under a different American Community Survey question that asks, “When did this person come to live in the U.S.?” Under this measure, 246,000 Mexicans, 195,000 Chinese and 199,000 Indians arrived in the U.S. in 2013 and 2012. (We report two years because the 2013 arrivals represent only about half of the year given the way the data are collected.)\nRegardless of the exact number of new immigrants from each country arriving in the U.S. each year, the trends are clear: Over the past decade, immigration from China and India to the U.S. has increased steadily, while immigration from Mexico has declined sharply. This shift in immigration is noteworthy because since 1965 Mexico has sent more immigrants (16.2 million) to the United States than any other country, in what has been the largest wave of immigration in U.S history (Pew Research Center, 2015).\n“Foreign born” refers to people born outside of the United States, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories and neither of their parents was a U.S. citizen. The terms “foreign born” and “immigrant” are used interchangeably in this report.\n“U.S. born” refers to individuals who are U.S. citizens at birth, including people born in the United States, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories, as well as those born elsewhere to parents who were U.S. citizens. The U.S.-born population encompasses the second generation and the third and higher generation.\n“Legal immigrants” are those who have been granted legal permanent residence, those granted asylum, people admitted as refugees and people admitted to the U.S. under a set of specific authorized temporary statuses for longer-term residence and work. This group includes “naturalized citizens,” legal immigrants who have become U.S. citizens through naturalization; “legal permanent resident aliens,” who have been granted permission to stay indefinitely in the U.S. as permanent residents, asylees or refugees; and “legal temporary migrants” (including students, diplomats and “high-tech guest workers”), who are allowed to live and, in some cases, work in the U.S. for specific periods of time (usually longer than one year).\n“Unauthorized immigrants” are all foreign-born non-citizens residing in the country who are not legal immigrants. These definitions reflect standard and customary usage by the Department of Homeland Security and academic researchers. The vast majority of unauthorized immigrants entered the country without valid documents or arrived with valid visas but stayed past their visa expiration date or otherwise violated the terms of their admission.\n“Immigration” to the United States includes only people who are intending to settle in the United States. U.S. decennial censuses and surveys include people whose usual residence is the United States. Consequently, migrants from Mexico who are in the U.S. for short periods to work, visit or shop are generally not included in measures of the U.S. population.\n“Return migration” is a concept based on a census or survey question about prior residence, specifically residence five years before the census or survey. A “return migrant” to Mexico is a person who lived outside of Mexico (usually in the U.S.) five years before the census or survey and is back in Mexico at the time of the survey.\n“Recent migrants” are identified through a question in Mexican censuses and surveys that asks whether any members of the household have left to go to the U.S. in a prior period, usually the previous five years. The recent migrants may be back in the household or elsewhere in Mexico (in which case they have “returned” to Mexico) or they may still be in the U.S. or in another country.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

It would raise nearly $12 billion over four years.\n“We’ve updated our proposal to reflect the feedback we received from our colleagues and the public,” said Sen. Noel Frame (D-Seattle), vice chair for finance of the Senate Ways & Means Committee. “This progressive revenue proposal raises taxes on some of the biggest, most profitable corporations worldwide and the wealthiest few individuals, directing funding to public schools, community safety, and the essential services people count on from their government. These proposals are a key step in modernizing our nearly 100-year-old tax code to meet the economy and needs of the 21st century.”\n“The gaps between working families and the gains by the wealthiest in our state have resulted in not enough funding for our schools, a safety net that is at risk every time revenue collection drops or costs go up, and working Washingtonians struggling to make ends meet,” said Rep. April Berg (D-Mill Creek), Chair of the House Finance Committee. “This revenue package finds a balance to meet our short-term need of addressing the budget shortfall and protecting the critical services on which our communities rely, as well as our long-term goal of reforming our outdated, unfair tax code.”\nB&O Tax & Big Businesses\nHouse Bill 2081 and Senate Bill 5815 include several changes to our Business & Occupation (B&O) tax to make it more progressive and ensure some of the world’s largest corporations pay what they owe. The bill raises the base rate for wholesaling and manufacturing from 0.484% to 0.5% and for retailing from 0.471% to 0.5% —rates which haven’t been updated since 1993. It also increases the base rate on services over $1 million from 1.75% to 2.1%, raising additional revenue from those larger businesses which typically have higher profit margins than manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers.\nThe bill raises surcharges on big banks (from 1.2% to 1.5%) and advance computer services (from 1.22% to 5%, increasing the cap from $9 to $50 million) and adds a new, temporary 0.5% surcharge on businesses earning more than $250 million annually — generating progressive revenue from some of the world’s largest, most profitable corporations, many of which are poised to receive a windfall due to the ongoing debate on the extension of the Trump Administration’s 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.\nHB 2081 is scheduled to be heard in the House Finance Committee Friday, April 18 and SB 5815 is scheduled to be heard in the Senate Ways & Means Committee Wednesday, April 16.\nMaking the Capital Gains Tax and Estate Tax More Progressive\nSB 5813 and HB 2082 would make our capital gains and estate taxes more progressive with higher rates on the very wealthiest Washingtonians. On the capital gains tax, a tiered structure would be created with an additional 2.9% surcharge on profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets above $1 million per year. For the estate tax, it would exclude smaller estates up to $3 million in value – indexed to inflation (CPI) moving forward – and create a more progressive structure with higher rates on larger estates – up to 35%. The revenue would be dedicated to K-12 schools, early learning, childcare, and higher education through the Education Legacy Trust Account.\nSB 5813 is scheduled to be heard in the Senate Ways & Means Committee Wednesday, April 16.\nClosing Ineffective & Obsolete Tax Exemptions\nThe proposal amends SB 5794, which repeals tax exemptions where the public policy objective was not met, is unclear whether the policy objective was met, or the exemption is legally obsolete, according to nonpartisan auditors at the Joint Legislative Audit & Review Committee. It also adds public policy objectives to several exemptions that currently lack them to help guide future reviews and evaluations of tax exemption performance and repeals unused tax preferences.\nSB 5794 is scheduled for amendment to narrow the previously proposed list of exemptions and executive session in the Senate Ways & Means Committee Friday, April 18.\nProperty Tax Reform\nThe proposal includes the previously introduced SB 5798 and a new bill, SB 5812, companion to HB 2049, which together would raise the property tax growth limit for the state’s common schools levy, as well as for cities, counties, and special purpose districts, from the current 1% cap to the combined rate of population growth plus inflation, up to a maximum of 3% — similar to the original House plan. The bill would also change local school levy authority and the state’s Local Effort Assistance funding.\nSB 5798 is expected to be amended and narrowed to be a tax reduction focused on expanding the “Property Tax Exemption for Senior Citizens and People with Disabilities” program by fully exempting its participants from paying the state property tax, reducing costs for some of our most vulnerable residents, and expanding eligibility to those earning up to 80% of a county’s median income (CMI) for the exemption, and up to 90% of CMI for the deferral program.\nHB 2049 is scheduled for executive session in the House Finance Committee Friday, April 18, and SB 5798 is scheduled for executive session in the Senate Ways & Means Committee that same day.\nSales Tax Modernization and More\nThe proposal also includes SB 5814 and HB 2083, legislation to update the state sales tax code to reflect elements of Washington’s modern economy. The bill applies sales tax to computer related business activities, including custom software development, custom web design, and IT training, technical assistance, and consulting. It also repeals the sales tax exemption for digital automated services, including advertising, and extends sales tax to temporary staffing services and investigative and security services. It also institutes a tobacco tax on Zyn packs.\nSB 5814 is scheduled to be heard in the Senate Ways & Means Committee Wednesday, April 16.\nThe revenue package and the underlying budget must pass the Legislature before session’s end on April 27.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        In summary\nCalifornia is experiencing unexpectedly shaky economic conditions, as health care costs rise and Trump’s tariffs create ongoing uncertainty.\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that California is facing a $12 billion budget deficit, spurred by soaring costs for social services as the state’s economy teeters from President Donald Trump’s chaotic tariffs strategy.\nUnveiling his revised $322 billion spending plan, Newsom repeatedly blamed the tariffs for undermining key industries and eroding financial markets that are crucial to California’s fiscal health — a “Trump slump” that he forecasts will reduce tax revenues by billions of dollars next year.\n“California is under assault, the United States of America in many respects is under assault, because we have a president that’s been reckless in terms of assaulting those growth engines and has created a climate of deep uncertainty,” Newsom said. “The impacts are being felt disproportionately in the fourth-largest economy in the world.”\nBut the size of Newsom’s budget proposal remains virtually unchanged from an earlier version in January, when the governor projected a modest surplus, underscoring that runaway expenses for subsidized health care and other state programs are the biggest long-term challenges.\nNewsom is proposing to close the deficit by rolling back state-funded insurance coverage for adults without legal immigration status, cutting coverage for weight loss drugs like Ozempic and reducing home health services, as well as sweeping billions of dollars out of speciality funds to backfill core services.\n“We’ve got a spending problem,” Newsom acknowledged, defending the potential cuts against anticipated blowback. “We can deny that we have a shortfall. We can deny that we have a deficit. We can deny we have a problem in the system and we could put it off and be irresponsible.”\nHis approach will force hard conversations about priorities with the state Legislature as they race to reach a budget deal before the start of the fiscal year in July. Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire of Santa Rosa and Senate budget chair Scott Wiener of San Francisco, both Democrats, gave only a tepid initial response, saying in a joint statement that they “remain focused and prepared to protect the people and progress we’ve made over the years.”\nCalifornia’s financial picture was troubled even before the recent turmoil. Newsom and the Legislature took extraordinary steps last summer to close a budget gap projected in the tens of billions of dollars over two years, including more than $28 billion in 2025-26.\nThe $12 billion deficit in Newsom’s revised budget proposal represents an additional shortfall after state officials agreed last year to sweeping cuts to state agencies and positions, clawing back funding increases for health care providers, eliminating affordable housing programs, delaying money for schools, suspending business tax credits and dipping into reserves.\nNewsom seeks major cuts to Medi-Cal\nMedi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for low-income people, has reported a more than $6 billion cost overrun this year — in part because an expansion to include immigrants without legal status brought in more new enrollees than expected — and it needed an emergency cash infusion in March.\nThat program is targeted for major reductions in Newsom’s budget proposal: a freeze on new enrollment of adults who are in the country illegally, as well as a $100 monthly premium and cuts to long-term care and dental benefits for those who maintain their coverage. The governor estimates those moves could eventually save more than $6 billion annually.\nThe governor is also proposing to undo a recent rule eliminating asset tests for seniors, a factor that state analysts found has contributed to a 40% growth in senior Medi-Cal enrollment over the past four years.\nHis plan would borrow billions of dollars from a special fund intended to raise reimbursement rates for Medi-Cal providers and shift more than $1.5 billion out of a fund intended for projects to reduce greenhouse gases to pay for the state’s firefighting operations.\nNewsom is also looking to save money by closing another state prison, a cut made possible because California’s incarcerated population has declined by nearly half, to 91,000 people, in the past two decades. It would be the fifth state prison to close during his administration, though Newsom did not specify which one.\nThe devastating fires that hit Los Angeles in January have introduced new uncertainty for the budget, because the tax deadline for Los Angeles County — where a quarter of all Californians live — was delayed until October.\nBut the most significant risk to tax receipts is undoubtedly from Trump’s tariffs. California estimates that revenues would be $16 billion higher next year if not for the president’s sweeping import duties, which Newsom sued last month to block.\nStock market declines are poised to take a bite out of future income tax revenue, because California relies disproportionately on capital gains earned by the wealthiest taxpayers; that accounts for $10 billion of the projected revenue decline. Higher costs from the tariffs are also imperiling major sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism and shipping in California, whose largest trading partner is China.\nRepublicans slammed Newsom for trying to foist responsibility onto Trump for a budget crisis they argue is largely a self-inflicted wound from overspending.\nSen. Roger Niello of Roseville, who serves as vice chair of the Senate budget committee, complained that Newsom “said absolutely nothing about what we need to do to close those gaps, the Gavin gaps, in the budget years after” this one, when state fiscal analysts predict California will have ongoing annual deficits of more than $20 billion.\nNext step: Negotiating with lawmakers\nBargaining with legislative leaders will ramp up over the next month, with a June 15 deadline for the Legislature to pass a balanced budget or forgo its pay, though sometimes provisions of an overall deal drag out beyond that.\n“Anyone who thinks we’re not going to make cuts this year is not in touch with reality,” Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat who leads the Assembly budget committee, told CalMatters. “Advocates who are proposing major expansions of programs should stop wasting people’s time.”\nCalifornia’s public universities, however, saw a rosier forecast in the budget announcement — cuts of 3%, far below the initial 7.95% cuts Newsom proposed in January. Lawmakers this year rallied to prevent the original, deeper cuts to the University of California and California State University systems.\nThat still means $130 million less for UC and $144 million less for CSU, which is particularly reliant on state funding and says it faces larger class sizes, fewer course options and likely layoffs as a result.\nAnother spending proposal was spared: a $420 million annual increase of California’s film and television tax credit, more than doubling the pot of available subsidies and boosting the amount that individual productions can receive. It’s a priority for Newsom, with the strong backing of many Los Angeles-area legislators, especially as the region seeks a comeback after the fires.\n“I want to get the economy moving again,” Newsom said. “Revenue doesn’t come from trees, it doesn’t come from printing presses.”\nTrump’s effort to slash federal spending is another looming question mark. Congressional Republicans have floated shifting more of the cost of social safety net programs to the states, though they are struggling to reach a budget agreement.\nIf they ultimately push through major changes to federal funding, lawmakers could be back in Sacramento later this year or early next year revising the state budget once again.\n“Ninety percent of the ball game is in Washington,” Gabriel said. “It’s frustrating to me that this is beyond our control.”\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Published on January 17, 2025\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX) has put out a list of proposals for budget reconciliation, which includes $12 billion in cuts to school breakfast and lunch. The proposals would dramatically reduce the number of schools able to offer free meals to all their students and impose significant and burdensome school meal paperwork requirements that would limit access to free and reduced-price school meals in non-Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) schools.\nCEP allows high-need schools to offer breakfast and lunch to all their students at no charge, and the proposal would make more than 24,000 schools across the country, serving more than 12 million children, no longer eligible to participate in CEP. The table below details the impact of the proposal by state.\nCEP dramatically reduces administrative work for schools by eliminating the need for school food service departments to process school meal forms, and to no longer deal with school meal debt. Rather than using individual student eligibility to determine the school meal reimbursements, CEP schools are reimbursed based on their percentage of poverty, as determined by students’ participation in other means-tested programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and in many states, Medicaid. Currently, schools qualify if 25 percent of students receive these benefits (called identified students). This is a subset of the number of children who are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals, since more students would be certified through the school meal application process. The proposal would increase the eligibility threshold from 25 percent to 60.\nTaking away this important and effective way for local schools to offer breakfast and lunch at no charge to all of their students would increase hunger in the classroom, reintroduce unnecessary paperwork for families and schools, increase school meal debt, and bring stigma back into the cafeteria. Schools should continue to have the choice to participate in CEP, which ensures that all students have access to nutritious school breakfasts and lunches that fuel their health and learning.\nThe Chairman’s proposal would also require all families who apply and are approved for free and reduced-price meals at non-CEP schools to document their household income when they submit their school meal application. Many eligible children would lose access to free and reduced-price school meals, and the administrative burden on schools to process school meal applications would dramatically increase. This change is estimated to reduce the cost of school meals by $9 billion dollars.\nEnsuring that students are well-fed is part of safeguarding the health and well-being of our country’s children, which is essential to our national security. While participation in CEP has increased tremendously over the last decade, financial barriers preventing many eligible schools from participating remain. Congress should be working to strengthen and expand CEP so all eligible schools can benefit, not reducing the number of schools that qualify.\n| State | Number of Schools Affected | Number of Children Affected |\n|---|---|---|\n| Alabama | 202 | 100,290 |\n| Alaska | 102 | 19,066 |\n| Arizona | 366 | 148,062 |\n| Arkansas | 196 | 82,364 |\n| California | 4,091 | 2,452,931 |\n| Colorado | 557 | 206,293 |\n| Connecticut | 262 | 128,388 |\n| Delaware | 129 | 64,741 |\n| District of Columbia | 41 | 15,251 |\n| Florida | 1,175 | 1,014,942 |\n| Georgia | 501 | 320,818 |\n| Hawaii | 52 | 27,018 |\n| Idaho | 54 | 20,555 |\n| Illinois | 140 | 80,636 |\n| Indiana | 284 | 122,769 |\n| Iowa | 124 | 68,296 |\n| Kansas | 76 | 27,711 |\n| Kentucky | 631 | 360,485 |\n| Louisiana | 469 | 253,062 |\n| Maine | 75 | 21,884 |\n| Maryland | 393 | 251,318 |\n| Massachusetts | 469 | 221,477 |\n| Michigan | 1,327 | 503,793 |\n| Minnesota | 204 | 87,503 |\n| Mississippi | 119 | 55,376 |\n| Missouri | 247 | 80,124 |\n| Montana | 75 | 10,142 |\n| Nebraska | 49 | 12,432 |\n| Nevada | 484 | 348,192 |\n| New Hampshire | 4 | 727 |\n| New Jersey | 227 | 93,251 |\n| New Mexico | 665 | 216,669 |\n| New York | 1,784 | 908,567 |\n| North Carolina | 794 | 408,887 |\n| North Dakota | 15 | 3,954 |\n| Ohio | 728 | 287,362 |\n| Oklahoma | 311 | 102,194 |\n| Oregon | 707 | 285,272 |\n| Pennsylvania | 666 | 320,262 |\n| Rhode Island | 73 | 36,263 |\n| South Carolina | 351 | 246,009 |\n| South Dakota | 37 | 7,600 |\n| Tennessee | 598 | 280,726 |\n| Texas | 1,711 | 974,497 |\n| Utah | 57 | 24,964 |\n| Vermont | 188 | 47,153 |\n| Virginia | 784 | 451,117 |\n| Washington | 987 | 465,853 |\n| West Virginia | 468 | 182,745 |\n| Wisconsin | 309 | 107,541 |\n| Wyoming | 17 | 2,024 |\n| U.S. Total | 24,559 | 12,473,887 |\nThis data reflects Community Eligibility participation as reported by state agencies for the 2023-2024 school year.\nSource: Food Research & Action Center.

Used as a means of controlling “undesirable” populations – immigrants, people of color, poor people, unmarried mothers, the disabled, the mentally ill – federally-funded sterilization programs took place in 32 states throughout the 20th century.\nAs historian William Deverell explains in a piece discussing the “Asexualization Acts” that led to the sterilization of more than 20,000 California men and women,“If you are sterilizing someone, you are saying, if not to them directly, ‘Your possible progeny are inassimilable, and we choose not to deal with that.’”\nAccording to Andrea Estrada at UC Santa Barbara, forced sterilization was particularly rampant in California:\nBeginning in 1909 and continuing for 70 years, California led the country in the number of sterilization procedures performed on men and women, often without their full knowledge and consent. Approximately 20,000 sterilizations took place in state institutions, comprising one-third of the total number performed in the 32 states where such action was legal. (from The UC Santa Barbara Current)\n—\n“There is today one state,” wrote Hitler, “in which at least weak beginnings toward a better conception [of citizenship] are noticeable. Of course, it is not our model German Republic, but the United States.” (from The L.A. Times)\nResearcher Alex Stern, author of the new book Eugenic Nation: Faults and Frontiers of Better Breeding in America, adds:\n“In the early 20th century across the country, medical superintendents, legislators, and social reformers affiliated with an emerging eugenics movement joined forces to put sterilization laws on the books. Such legislation was motivated by crude theories of human heredity that posited the wholesale inheritance of traits associated with a panoply of feared conditions such as criminality, feeblemindedness, and sexual deviance. Many sterilization advocates viewed reproductive surgery as a necessary public health intervention that would protect society from deleterious genes and the social and economic costs of managing ‘degenerate stock’.”\nEugenics was a commonly accepted means of protecting society from the offspring (and therefore equally suspect) of those individuals deemed inferior or dangerous – the poor, the disabled, the mentally ill, criminals, and people of color.\nMore recently, California prisons are said to have authorized sterilizations of nearly 150 female inmates between 2006 and 2010. The Center for Investigative Reporting reveals how the state paid doctors $147,460 to perform tubal ligations that former inmates say were done under coercion.\nBut California is far from being the only state with such troubled practices. For a disturbing history lesson, check out this comprehensive database for your state’s eugenics history. You can find out more information on state-by-state sterilization policies, the number of victims, institutions where sterilizations were performed, and leading opponents and proponents.\nWhile California’s eugenics programs were driven in part by anti-Asian and anti-Mexican prejudice, Southern states also employed sterilization as a means of controlling African American populations. “Mississippi appendectomies” was another name for unnecessary hysterectomies performed at teaching hospitals in the South on women of color as practice for medical students.\nFor a closer look, see Belle Bogg’s “For the Public Good,” with original video by Olympia Stone that features Willis Lynch, who was sterilized at the age of 14 while living in a North Carolina juvenile detention facility.\nGregory W. Rutecki, MD writes about the forced sterilization of Native Americans, which persisted into the 1970s and 1980s, with examples of young women receiving tubal ligations when they were getting appendectomies. It’s estimated that as many as 25-50 percent of Native American women were sterilized between 1970 and 1976. Forced sterilization programs are also a part of history in Puerto Rico, where sterilization rates are said to be the highest in the world.\nLandmark Cases\nThe film No Más Bebés follows the story of Mexican American women who were sterilized under duress while giving birth at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center in the 1960s and 1970s. Madrigal v. Quilligan, the case portrayed in the film, is one of several landmark cases that’s affected the reproductive rights of underserved populations, for better or for worse.\nHere are some other important cases:\nBuck v. Bell: In 1927, Carrie Buck, a poor white woman, was the first person to be sterilized in Virginia under a new law. Carrie’s mother had been involuntarily institutionalized for being “feebleminded” and “promiscuous.” Carrie was assumed to have inherited these traits, and was sterilized after giving birth. This Supreme Court case led to the sterilization of 65,000 Americans with mental illness or developmental disabilities from the 1920s to the ’70s. (Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in reference to Carrie: “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”) The court ruling still stands today.\nExcerpt from the documentary Fixed to Fail: Buck vs. Bell:\nRelf v. Weinberger: Mary Alice and Minnie Relf, poor African American sisters from Alabama, were sterilized at the ages of 14 and 12. Their mother, who was illiterate, had signed an “X” on a piece of paper she believed gave permission for her daughters, who were both mentally disabled, to receive birth control shots. In 1974, the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Relf sisters, revealing that 100,000 to 150,000 poor people were being sterilized each year under federally-funded programs.\nEugenics Compensation Act: In December 2015, the US Senate voted unanimously to help surviving victims of forced sterilization. North Carolina has paid $35,000 to 220 surviving victims of its eugenics program. Virginia agreed to give surviving victims $25,000 each.\nReproductive Justice Today\nWhile the case in No Más Bebés occurred forty years ago, issues of reproductive justice are still relevant today, as state laws continue to restrict access to abortion and birth control. Deborah Reid of the National Health Law program writes:\n“The concept of reproductive justice, which is firmly rooted in a human rights framework that supports the ability of all women to make and direct their own reproductive decisions. These decisions could include obtaining contraception, abortion, sterilization, and/or maternity care. Accompanying that right is the obligation of the government and larger society to create laws, policies, and systems conducive to supporting those decisions.”\nFor organizations such as the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, reproductive justice involves not only access to affordable birth control, abortion, and health care, but also providing access to women who are being held in immigration detention centers.\nIt’s work that connects the dots between power inequities and bodily self-determination – something the eugenics movement sought to limit. As No Más Bebés director Renee Tajima-Peña says in an interview with Colorlines: “The reproductive justice framework is to make sure that people listen to the needs and the voices of poor women, women of color and immigrant women who’ve been marginalized.”\n2022 Update:\nRead this comprehensive new article by Natalie Lira for PBS’s American Experience and The Latino Experience: “Latinos and the Consequences of Eugenics.”\n2020 Updates:\nThe documentary Belly of the Beast tackles a more recent, equally shocking story of forced sterilizations — in this case in women’s prisons. As the women who investigate these cases discover, despite it being nearly forty years after being banned— forced sterilization continued for decades in women’s prisons, shielded by prison officials and doctors inside the correctional system. And may even still be happening. Read the interview with Belly of the Beast filmmaker Erika Cohn to learn more.\nAnd as Cohn references in that interview, 2020 saw the revelation that there were forced sterilizations performed in an ICE detention center in Georgia.

You cannot possess a paddlefish license or transportation tag issued to another angler or tag a paddlefish with a transportation tag issued to another angler.\n- The transportation tag must remain attached to the paddlefish until it is processed for consumption. The paddlefish must remain intact except for the snout in front of the eye until the fish reaches the final processing place. The “final processing place” is defined as your home or the location where consumption occurs. The transportation tag is your proof of possession of the carcass.\n- Cut a slit in the jaw for the transportation tag. Slide the tag’s tab into the slot until locked.\nClosed Season\n- During the closed season, you cannot possess paddlefish on waters opened to paddlefish snagging during the season.\nHarvesting Tips\nWhy Snagging\nPaddlefish are one of the largest freshwater fish in North America. The Iowa state record for a paddlefish is 107 pounds, caught in 1981 on the Missouri River. Paddlefish feed on microscopic organisms called zooplankton. Since they are filter feeders, they cannot be caught effectively with traditional hook-and-line methods; snagging is the only efficient method of take.\nRecommended Gear\n- Use long, heavy action rods with 50 – 100 pound test line. Longer rods let you snag at a slower pace with longer sweeps to cover more water area.\n- Whether you prefer bait casting or spinning reels, make sure the reel is well maintained with functional drag.\n- In Iowa, you must use treble hooks 5/0 or smaller for snagging. Many anglers recommend 2/0 – 5/0 hooks tied 18 – 36 inches above a 2- to 6-ounce weight. Heavier weights are better for casting in fast, Deep water. Use lighter weights when fish are closer to the surface or in slow-moving water.\nTechniques\n- Paddlefish prefer slower, deep water. Scout with a depth finder for pockets of deep water, or head to areas slightly downstream from wing dams. Paddlefish feed in the current coming off the end of the dam.\n- Some anglers prefer to vertically snag for paddlefish from a stationary boat over a deep hole. Another option is to cast into the current seam from shore or an anchored boat. This is very effective in shallower areas where angler activity may frighten fish out of the area.\nSafety Precautions\n- Be safe when heading out on spring waters. Rivers can change over the winter with new downed trees, snags, floating ice and even changing locations of sandbars. Be aware of your surroundings while boating. Make sure your boat motor is running properly after being stored during the winter.\n- Going overboard into cold water can be dangerous and possibly fatal. Have dry clothes with you. Do not snag from dangerous positions in the boat. Keep a knife or pliers nearby in case you find yourself attached to a large fish by a treble hook or heavy fishing line. Know your own limitations; heavy rods and reels, and a long day of snagging, can prove tiring for people with lower physical strength.\nWhat Can I Use to Take Fish?\nYou can use gaff hooks or landing nets to help land fish. You can take rough fish (carp, buffalo, quillback, gar, sheepshead, dogfish) day or night, by:\n- snagging\n- spear\n- bow and arrow\nWhat Cannot be Used to Catch Fish?\nYou cannot use to take or try to take any fish by:\n- grabhook\n- snaghook\n- net\n- seine\n- trap\n- firearm\n- dynamite\n- explosives\n- poisonous substances\n- stupefying substances\n- lime\n- ashes\n- electricity\nHow Many Lines and Hooks Can I Use?\n- you can use one or two lines when still fishing or trolling. each line can have one or two hooks.\n- each single pointed hook is counted as one hook.\n- each double-pointed hook is counted as one hook.\n- each treble-pointed hook is counted as one hook.\n- all hooks attached as a part of an artificial bait or lure are counted as one hook.\n- you can use one or two flies on one line when fly fishing.\n- you can use one or two trolling spoons or artificial baits on one line when trolling and bait casting.\nHow Close Do You Have to be in Attendance of Your Fishing Tackle?\nYou must be in visual sight of your fishing tackle when they are being fished in the water.\nCan You Use a Tip-up Fishing Device for Ice Fishing?\nA \"tip-up fishing device'' is an ice fishing mechanism, with an attached flag or signal to indicate fishing action, used to hold a fishing rod or pole with line and hook.\nYou can use one or two lines with two hooks while tip-up fishing on all inland waters and the Big Sioux River. You may fish a combination of one tip-up fishing device and one additional line, or, two tip-up fishing devices and no additional lines.\nThe following regulations apply when fishing the Mississippi River or Missouri River and connected backwater:\n- you cannot use more than three tip-up fishing devices.\n- you can use two or three hooks on the same line, but the total number of hooks you use cannot exceed three.\n- each tip-up fishing device you use must have a tag attached, plainly labeled with the your name and address.\n- you must be 300 feet or more from a dam or spillway to use a tip-up fishing device.\n- you cannot use tip-up fishing devices in a part of the river which is closed or posted against their use.\n- you can use three tip-up fishing devices in addition to two lines with no more than two hooks per line.\nCan You Use Trotlines or Throw Lines?\n\"Trotlines\" are lines commonly called \"tagged lines,\" \"throw lines,\" \"bank lines,\" \"ditty lines, \" \"ditty poles\" and other names. You can use trotlines in all rivers and streams of the state, except those in Mitchell, Howard, Winneshiek, Allamakee, Fayette, Clayton, Delaware, Dubuque, and Jackson counties. Trotlines may be used in the above nine counties only in the following stream sections:\n- Mississippi River\n- Maquoketa River, mouth to Backbone State Park dam\n- North Fork Maquoketa River, mouth to Jones-Dubuque county line\n- Turkey River, mouth to Elkader dam\n- Upper Iowa River, mouth to the first dam upstream in Winneshiek county\nYou need a valid sport fishing license to use \"trotlines\". You can use one to five \"trotlines\". All the \"trotlines\" you are using can have a total of 15 hooks.\nFor example: you can have one \"trotline\" with 15 hooks or 5 \"trotlines\" with three hooks each. Each separate \"trotline\" must have a tag attached, plainly labeled with the owner's name and address. You must check each \"trotline\" at least once every 24 hours.\nYou cannot use \"trotlines\" in a stocked lake, within 300 feet of a dam or spillway, or in a stream or portion of stream, which is closed or posted against their use. One end of the \"trotline\" must be set from the shore and visible above the shore waterline. You cannot set the \"trotline\" entirely across a stream or body of water. any conservation officer can remove untagged or unlawful lines.\nIs There a Boundary Water Sport Trotline?\nA boundary water sport trotline license applies to the waters of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Big Sioux rivers. You can use a maximum of four trotlines with 200 hooks (total) with a boundary water sport trotline license. All boundary water sport trotlines must be tagged with your name and address on a metal tag affixed above the waterline.\nYou cannot sell fish with a boundary water sport trotline license.\nSnagging Restrictions\nSnagging is Not Permitted in the Following Areas:\n- Des Moines River from directly below the hydro electric dam (Big Dam) to the Hawkeye Avenue Bridge in Fort Dodge.\n- Des Moines River from directly below the Little Dam to the Union Pacific Railroad Bridge in Fort Dodge.\n- Des Moines River from directly below Saylorville Dam to the Southeast 14th Street bridge in Des Moines.\n- Northeast bank of the Des Moines River from directly below the Ottumwa Dam, including the catwalk, to the Jefferson Street Bridge.

Most formerly enslaved people in the United States were remarkably willing to live peacefully with those who had held them in bondage despite the violence they had suffered and the degradation they had endured.\nEmancipated Black people put aside their enslavement and embraced education, hard work, faith, and citizenship with extraordinary enthusiasm and devotion. By 1868, over 80 percent of Black men who were eligible to vote had registered, schools for Black children became a priority, and courageous Black leaders overcame enormous obstacles to win elections to public office.\nThe new era of Reconstruction offered great promise and could have radically changed the history of this country. However, it quickly became clear that emancipation in the United States did not mean equality for Black people. The commitment to abolish chattel slavery was not accompanied by a commitment to equal rights or equal protection for African Americans and the hope of Reconstruction quickly became a nightmare of unparalleled violence and oppression.\nBetween 1865 and 1877, thousands of Black women, men, and children were killed, attacked, sexually assaulted, and terrorized by white mobs and individuals who were shielded from arrest and prosecution. White perpetrators of lawless, random violence against formerly enslaved people were almost never held accountable—instead, they frequently were celebrated. Emboldened Confederate veterans and former enslavers organized a reign of terror that effectively nullified constitutional amendments designed to provide Black people equal protection and the right to vote.\nIn a series of devastating decisions, the United States Supreme Court blocked Congressional efforts to protect formerly enslaved people. In decision after decision, the Court ceded control to the same white Southerners who used terror and violence to stop Black political participation, upheld laws and practices codifying racial hierarchy, and embraced a new constitutional order defined by “states’ rights.”\nWithin a decade after the Civil War, Congress began to abandon the promise of assistance to millions of formerly enslaved Black people. Violence, mass lynchings, and lawlessness enabled white Southerners to create a regime of white supremacy and Black disenfranchisement alongside a new economic order that continued to exploit Black labor. White officials in the North and West similarly rejected racial equality, codified racial discrimination, and occasionally embraced the same tactics of violent racial control seen in the South.\nIt was during Reconstruction that a century-long era of racial hierarchy, lynching, white supremacy, and bigotry was established—an era from which this nation has yet to recover.\nMost Americans know very little about the Reconstruction era and its legacy. Historians have frequently overlooked this critical 12-year period that has had profound impact on life in the United States. Our collective ignorance of what happened immediately after the Civil War has contributed to misinformed stereotypes and misguided false narratives about who is honorable and who is not and has allowed bigotry and a legacy of racial injustice to persist.\nIn 2015, the Equal Justice Initiative issued a new report that detailed over 4,400 documented racial terror lynchings of Black people in America between 1877 and 1950.\nWe now report that during the 12-year period of Reconstruction at least 2,000 Black women, men, and children were victims of racial terror lynchings.\nThousands more were assaulted, raped, or injured in racial terror attacks between 1865 and 1877. The rate of documented racial terror lynchings during Reconstruction is nearly three times greater than during the era we reported on in 2015. Dozens of mass lynchings took place during Reconstruction in communities across the country in which hundreds of Black people were killed.\nTragically, the rate of unknown lynchings of Black people during Reconstruction is also almost certainly dramatically higher than the thousands of unknown lynchings that took place between 1877 and 1950 for which no documentation can be found. The retaliatory killings of Black people by white Southerners immediately following the Civil War alone likely number in the thousands.\nEJI presents this report to provide context and analysis of what happened during this tragic period of American history and to describe its implications for the issues we face today. We believe our nation has failed to adequately address or acknowledge our history of racial injustice and that we must commit to a new era of truth-telling followed by meaningful efforts to repair and remedy the continuing legacy of racial oppression. We hope this report sparks much needed conversation and encourages communities to join us in the important task of advancing truth and justice.\nBryan Stevenson, Director\nChapter 1\nJourney to Freedom\nEmancipation and Citizenship\n“Just before the war, a white preacher, he come to us slaves and says: ‘Do you want to keep your homes where you get all to eat, and raise your children, or do you want to be free to roam around without a home, like the wild animals? If you want to keep your homes you better pray for the South to win. All that wants to pray for the South to win, raise your hand.’ We all raised our hands ‘cause we was scared not to, but we sho’ didn’t want the South to win.”1 “William M. Adams, Fort Worth, Texas.” Federal Writers’ Project: Slave Narrative Project, Vol. 16, Texas, Part 1, Adams-Duhon. 1936.\nIn this Chapter\nIn this Chapter\nDuring the Transatlantic Slave Trade, an estimated 10.7 million African men, women, and children were kidnapped and sold into captivity in North America, South America, or Central America.2 David Eltis & Paul F. Lachance, Estimates of the Size and Direction of Transatlantic Slave Trade (2010). An estimated two million more people died during the brutal voyage across the Atlantic Ocean.3 Ibid. Though enslavement existed in other parts of the world, the unique system that developed in the United States became a racialized caste system rooted in a false but violent and persistent idea of racial difference.4 Frank Tannenbaum, Slave and Citizen: The Negro in the Americas (New York: Vintage Books, 1947), 65. Chattel slavery in this country permanently deprived the enslaved of any legal rights or autonomy and permitted their violent economic exploitation.\nEnslavement in the English colonies persisted after the Revolutionary War and the creation of the United States. Indeed, as the United States laid the foundation for its experiment in freedom and democracy, it also oversaw and benefitted from the kidnapping, human trafficking, lifelong bondage, and complete dehumanization of African people—a system of enslavement repeatedly enforced by the nation’s courts, political institutions, core documents, and most revered founders.\n“I don’t believe in the colored race being slaves ‘cause of their color, but the war didn’t make time much better for a long time. Some of them had a worse time.”5 “Liney Chambers, Brinkley, Arkansas.” Federal Writer’s Project: Slave Narrative Project, Vol. 2, Arkansas, Part 2, Cannon-Evans, 1936.\nIn 1808, Congress banned the international slave trade and halted the trafficking of African people to the country6 Adam Rothman, “The Domestication of the Slave Trade in the United States,” in The Chattel Principle: Internal Slave Trades in the Americas (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 40; Frederic Bancroft, Slave Trading in the Old South (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press,\n1996), 67. but did nothing to end enslavement within the nation’s borders. This resulted in a large unmet demand for enslaved Black people, especially in territories like Mississippi and Alabama that were gaining statehood and attracting white settlers with agricultural ambition.\nThe Domestic Slave Trade emerged to fill the void. The potential profit to be made from selling Black people already enslaved in the country skyrocketed. Though less well known than the Transatlantic Slave Trade, the domestic sale of enslaved Black people from the Upper and Eastern South resulted in the trafficking of millions—including many free Black people kidnapped and sold into enslavement7 See Slavery in America: The Montgomery Slave Trade (Montgomery, Alabama: Equal Justice Initiative, 2018), 39.—and fueled a massive increase in the Deep South’s enslaved population over the next 50 years.8 David L. Lightner, Slavery and the Commerce Power: How the Struggle Against the Interstate Slave Trade Led to the Civil War (Chelsea, MI: Sheridan Books, 2006), 6; Steven Deyle, “The Domestic Slave Trade in America: The Lifeblood of the Southern Slave System,” in The Chattel\nPrinciple: Internal Slave Trades in the Americas (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 93; James Benson Sellers, Slavery in Alabama (Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press, 1950), 147.\nIn 1860, just a year before the start of the Civil War, enslavement was an entrenched and growing system, far from dying out or fading on its own.\nOver four million Black people were enslaved in the United States—more than at any point in the nation’s history9 William C. Davis and William Marvel, National Park Civil War Series: A Concise History of the Civil War (Ft. Washington, Pennsylvania: Eastern National, 2007).—and unprecedented numbers of Black people in this country were trapped in brutal, inhumane conditions.10 Both the Southern and Northern economies remained tied to and dependent upon the labor of enslaved Black people, as Northern merchants traded in cotton and other agricultural products produced by enslaved people, and Northern banks accepted enslaved human “property” as collateral for securitized loans. See Sven Beckert, “Slavery and Capitalism,” Chron. of Higher Educ., December 12, 2014; see also Edward E. Baptist, The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism (New York: Basic Books, 2016). Even as growing political support for the abolition of slavery pushed the country closer to war, few white people who supported a legal end to the institution expressed a commitment to eradicating the harmful ideas of racial difference created to defend it.11 Davis and Marvel, A Concise History of the Civil War.\nInequality After Enslavement\nOn the question of racial equality, there was often little distinction between slavery’s white supporters and detractors. “God has made the negro an inferior being not in most cases, but in all cases,” leading pro-slavery New Yorker John H. Van Evrie wrote in the 1850s.12 Ibram X. Kendi, Stamped From The Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America (New York: Bold Type Books, 2016), 198. Even New England abolitionist Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe openly expressed the view that Black people were naturally inferior to white people. He tried to drum up support for abolition by assuring white people that Black people would “dwindle and gradually disappear from the peoples of this continent” if freed.13 Ibid. at 228. Clearly an end to enslavement alone would not emancipate Black people from racism. But first things would have to come first.\nBeginning in 1861, 11 Southern states determined to maintain enslavement seceded from the Union to form the Confederate States of America.\nIn South Carolina, the first state to secede, legislators declared that “[a]n increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery” was a primary catalyst for their action.14 Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union (Dec. 24, 1860). As Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee followed, the Confederacy developed a platform of “states’ rights” and “home rule” that aimed to preserve white supremacy and enslavement.\nEven before the war’s end, Confederate hatred for Black autonomy and power led to brutal attacks. Black soldiers in the Union Army symbolized the height of Black “disobedience” and became immediate targets for violence that exceeded even the bounds of war.15 Leon F. Litwack, Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery (New York: Vintage Books, 1979), 182, 194-96.\nWhen an outnumbered “colored” unit of the Union Army surrendered Fort Pillow, Tennessee, to Confederate forces on April 12, 1864, the rules of war required the Confederates to take the 262 Black soldiers as prisoners. Instead, the Confederates massacred the Black men, along with nearby Black civilians. A later federal investigation concluded: “It is the intention of the rebel authorities not to recognize the officers and men of our colored regiments as entitled to the treatment accorded by all civilized nations to prisoners of war.”\nOn March 10, 1865, Confederate soldiers in Darlington, South Carolina, hanged a young Black woman named Amy Spain from a sycamore tree on the courthouse lawn. Accused of “treason and conduct unbecoming a slave” for aiding Union forces who had briefly occupied the town, Ms. Spain was killed just weeks before the end of the Civil War.16 Harper’s Weekly, “The Hanging of Amy Spain,” September 30, 1865; The Woodstock Sentinel (Ill.), “Amy Spain,” October 11, 1865; Eugene Fallon, “A Day Darlington Would Like to Forget: Confederate Forces Hanged Amy Spain 94Years Ago,” The Augusta Chronicle-Herald (Ga.), May 10, 1959.\nBy the time the war ended with Confederate surrender to the Union on April 9, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln had issued an Emancipation Proclamation abolishing slavery in the rebel territories and Congress had advanced a constitutional amendment that aimed to abolish slavery nationwide. “Slavery is dead,” read an editorial in The Cincinnati Enquirer published days after the surrender. “The negro is not; there is our misfortune.”17 Kendi, Stamped From the Beginning, 13, 214.\nIf the end of the war led the United States government to abandon the millions of Black people still living in the war-torn South amidst a beaten Confederacy, those emancipated people’s futures in freedom would be bleak and short-lived. In a November 1865 letter to Major General Steadman of the Union Army, 125 freedmen in Columbus, Georgia, begged federal troops to stay in the city:\nWe wish to inform you that if the Federal Soldiers are withdrawn from us, we will be left in a most gloomy and helpless condition. A number of Freedmen have already been killed in this section of country; and . . . we have every reason to fear that others will share a similar fate.18 “Request of the Freedmen of Columbus, Ga. to Maj. Gen. Steadman not to withdraw the Federal Troops and leave them unprotected,” Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865 – 1869. M798 Roll 36.\nFormerly enslaved Black people understood that federal intervention was necessary to require white Southerners to honor their rights as Americans. Their letter ended by pleading for federal troops “not to leave us to the tender mercy of our enemies—unprotected.”19 Ibid.\nDecades later, in his 1903 book, The Souls of Black Folk, W.E.B. Du Bois described the reality Black people faced. “Not a single Southern legislature stood ready to admit a Negro, under any conditions, to the polls,” he explained.\nNot a single Southern legislature believed free Negro labor was possible without a system of restrictions that took all its freedom away; there was scarcely a white man in the South who did not honestly regard Emancipation as a crime, and its practical nullification as a duty.20 W.E.B. Du Bois, “The Freedmen’s Bureau,” The Atlantic, March 1, 1901.\nAfter the Confederacy’s defeat, the United States was preserved but devastated, and faced an uncertain future. Many of the day’s most pressing questions asked: what would happen to the entrenched institution of slavery? And what fate would befall the millions of Black people who had been enslaved at the war’s start?\nThe 1863 Emancipation Proclamation left these questions unanswered. How the nation would travel from war to peace depended on how it would chart Black Americans’ path from slavery to freedom. Reconstruction became that path, but its initially hopeful promise proved to be short-lived, dangerous, and deadly.\nEmancipation by Proclamation—Then by Law\nIn September 1862, President Abraham Lincoln issued a preliminary proclamation announcing that, by executive order, he would declare the freedom of millions of Black people enslaved within the Confederacy—effective the following January. Enslavement was the core catalyst and conflict of the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation brought that conflict to a head.\nFor years before the Civil War, white people in the South had grown increasingly worried that federal authorities would try to force abolition upon the South, and increasingly certain that the resulting social and economic upheaval would destroy them all.\n“Can [white people] without indignation and horror contemplate the triumph of negro equality, and see his own sons and daughters in the not distant future associating with free negroes upon terms of political and social equality?” Alabama official Stephen F. Hale asked in a 1860 letter to the governor of Kentucky.21 “Stephen F. Hale to Beriah Magoffin, December 27, 1860,” reproduced in full in Charles B. Dew, Apostles of Disunion: Southern Secession Commissioners and the Cause of the Civil War (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 2001), 91-103. If slavery was abolished, Hale warned, “the two races would be continually pressing together,” and an “amalgamation or the extermination of the one or the other would be inevitable.”22 Ibid.\nThat fear and anxiety largely fueled the Confederate states’ secession movement. After Alabama seceded from the Union a year later, Hale represented the state in the Confederate Congress as one of many voices in a pro-slavery chorus. Hale died from battle wounds in 1862,23 Encyclopedia of Alabama, “Stephen F. Hale.” months before Lincoln’s preliminary proclamation, but the Confederate reaction largely mirrored his views.\n“They call Mr. Lincoln an ‘ape,’ a ‘fiend,’ a ‘beast,’ a ‘savage,’ a ‘highwayman,’” read an October 1862 issue of Harper’s Weekly, reporting on Southern reaction to Lincoln’s preliminary proclamation.\n[The Confederate] Congress is resolved into a dozen committees, each trying to devise some new form of retaliation to be inflicted upon United States citizens and soldiers, if we dare to carry the proclamation into effect, and tamper—to use the words of the Richmond Enquirer—with “four thousand millions” worth of property!24 Harper’s Weekly, “The President’s Proclamation in Secessia,” October 18, 1862.\nThe Confederate Congress responded to the preliminary proclamation with a resolution denouncing Lincoln’s act as “a violation of the usages of civilized warfare, an attack on private property, and an invitation to servile insurrection” and vowing to resist enforcement.25 Journal of the Congress of the Confederate States of America, Vol. II (Washington: Gov. Printing Office, 1904), 375-375, 393. But the proclamation did not enjoy uniform or widespread support in the North, either.\nIn the 1862 midterm elections, candidates challenging Lincoln’s political allies warned that Emancipation would bring an influx of free Black people into Northern states. “The general theme in the campaign, from New York to Iowa, was ‘Every white laboring man in the North who does not want to be swapped off for a free nigger should vote the [anti-Lincoln] Democratic ticket.’”26 Ibid. at 57. Indeed, many Northern states already had laws restricting emigration of free Black people, and had little more commitment to racial equality than their counterparts in the South. By the time election results were tallied, the anti-Emancipation message had won in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania and vaulted Horatio Seymour—the fiercely pro-slavery “white man’s candidate’—to the governor’s office in New York.27 William Nester, The Age of Lincoln and the Art of American Power, 1848-1876 (Lincoln, Nebraska: Potomac Books, 2014), 169; Pittsburgh Weekly Gazette, “Horatio Seymour,” October 8, 1869.\nFor all the opposition it inspired, the Emancipation Proclamation—more war measure than humanitarian act—stopped far short of ending slavery in the United States when it took effect on January 1, 1863.\nOn its face, the order declared the freedom of only those enslaved people held in states in rebellion against the United States, namely South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Arkansas, and North Carolina. The proclamation exempted Tennessee, as well as Union-occupied portions of Virginia and Louisiana, and left slavery wholly intact in the border states of Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri.28 Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team Of Rivals: The Political Genius Of Abraham Lincoln (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005), 464.\nMany Southern planters attempted to hide the news from enslaved people, using threats and violence to force silence and attacking those who dared attempt to flee.29 Ibid. at 182-83. Where federal troops were present, however, many enslaved people courageously fled bondage and sought protection and freedom in Union camps.30 See Jim Downs, Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering During the Civil War and Reconstruction (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012). For the many more enslaved people living where federal forces were absent or unreachable, Lincoln’s declaration did nothing, and the hold of enslavement lasted well beyond 1863.31 Litwack, Been In The Storm So Long, 172-74. Up until the war’s end in 1865, local newspapers in Montgomery, Alabama, continued to advertise auction sales of enslaved people and publish ads seeking the return of “runaways.”32 “Slave trading in Montgomery thrived well into the mid-1860s, even as the Civil War raged. As late as 1864, T.L. Frazer & Co. opened a new “slave market” in Montgomery on the south block of Market Street (present-day Dexter Avenue) between Lawrence and McDonough streets. In April 1864, a new firm of slave dealers announced plans to establish an office in Montgomery and promised to ‘‘keep constantly on hand a large and well selected stock such as families, house servants, gentlemens’ body servants, seamstresses, boys and girls of all descriptions, blacksmiths, field hands.” Tellingly, even after Robert E. Lee’s surrender, the Montgomery Daily Advertiser continued to run “reward” advertisements posted by slave owners seeking their runaway ‘property.’” Equal Justice Initiative, Slavery in America, 35.\nIn an August 1864 letter, a Black woman named Annie Davis living in Maryland asked Lincoln himself to clarify whether she remained in bondage. “Mr. President,” she began,\nIt is my Desire to be free. To go to see my people on the Eastern Shore. My mistress wont let me. You will please let me know if we are free and what I can do. I write to you for advice. Please send me word this week. or as soon as possible and oblidge [sic].33 “Annie Davis to Mr. President, 25 Aug. 1864,” D-304 1864, Letters Received, series 360, Colored Troops Division, Adjutant General’s Office, Record Group 94, National Archives.\nMs. Davis’s letter survives at the National Archives among correspondence received by the Colored Troops Division. There is no evidence she ever received a reply.\nIf abolition was to become permanent and widespread, what began with the limited Emancipation Proclamation would have to become broader, national law. In December 1863, as the war continued and the Confederate states remained in rebellion, Congress proposed a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery. It passed the Senate in April 1864 and, after extended debate and initial defeat, passed the House in January 1865. Ratification required approval by 27 of the 36 states, including in the South where states were still fighting a war to secede.\nWithin months, the Confederacy had surrendered, President Lincoln had been assassinated, and new federal laws required the rebel states to ratify the abolition amendment to be readmitted to the Union. The former Confederate states reluctantly complied. In early December 1865, Georgia became the 27th state to ratify, and the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted soon afterward. Several states nonetheless continued to resist ratification in symbolic defiance, even after legal abolition had been achieved—Delaware,34 Delaware ratified the Thirteenth Amendment in 1901. See Samuel B. Hoff, “Delaware’s Long Road to Ratification of the 13th Amendment,” Delaware Online, December 7, 2015. Kentucky,35 Kentucky ratified the Thirteenth Amendment in 1976. See The Indianapolis News, “Kentucky Ratifies 13th Amendment,” March 24, 1976. and Mississippi36 Mississippi did not officially ratify the Thirteenth Amendment until 1995, and did not formally file the ratification paperwork until February 7, 2013. See AP News, “130 Years After Civil War, Mississippi Senate Votes to Ban Slavery,” February 16, 1995; NPR.org, “After Snafu, Mississippi Ratifies Amendment Abolishing Slavery,” February 19, 2013. did not officially ratify the Thirteenth Amendment until the 20th century.\nPerhaps more importantly, ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment did not reflect or require a commitment to racial equality or an agreement that enslavement should end.\nThe Thirteenth Amendment’s adoption meant that the Constitution banned racialized chattel slavery—it did not mean that white Southerners recognized Black people as fully human or that Southern officials would enforce their new legal protections absent federal oversight.\nGeorge King, a Black man in Oklahoma, recalled in 1937 how freedom was explained to him when he was emancipated in South Carolina decades earlier: “The Master he says we are all free,” Mr. King said, “but it don’t mean we is white. And it don’t mean we is equal.”37 “George King,” Federal Writers’ Project: Slave Narrative Project, Vol. 13, Oklahoma, Adams-Young, 1936.\nFollowing the war, Black autonomy expanded but the white American identity remained deeply rooted in white supremacy. Southern white communities rejected the notion that federal law recognized their former property as people, and they resented the Union troops still stationed in the region to enforce this new reality. This Southern white resistance to Black legal rights required the law to go further in order to make Black freedom truly meaningful.\nThe year after the war’s end, a U.S. Congress still operating without representation from most Confederate states passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, declaring Black Americans full citizens entitled to equal civil rights.38 Act of April 9, 1866 (Civil Rights Act), Public Law 39-26, 14 STAT 27, which protected all persons in the United States in their civil rights and furnished the means of their vindication.\nPresident Andrew Johnson, who took office following Lincoln’s death, was a Tennessee native sympathetic to Southern sentiments. He vetoed the bill and vocally questioned “whether, where eleven of the thirty-six states are unrepresented in Congress at the time, it is sound policy to make our entire colored population, and all other excepted classes, citizens of the United States.”39 Andrew Johnson, “Veto of the Civil Rights Bill,” March 27, 1866. But Johnson also objected to the act’s substance:\nThe bill, in effect proposes a discrimination against large numbers of intelligent, worthy and patriotic foreigners and in favor of the negro, to whom, after long years of bondage, the avenues to freedom and intelligence have just now been suddenly opened. He must of necessity, from his previous unfortunate condition of servitude, be less informed as to the nature and character of our institutions than he who, coming from abroad, has to some extent, at least, familiarized himself with the principles of a Government to which he voluntarily entrusts life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.40 Ibid.\nIn April 1866, Congress—still celebrating the Union’s Civil War victory and persuaded by passionate rhetoric insisting rights legislation was needed to make that bloodshed meaningful—enacted the Civil Rights Act, overriding a presidential veto of a major piece of legislature for the first time in United States history.51 Foner, Reconstruction, 250-51.\nLawmakers next successfully passed the Fourteenth Amendment, which declared Black people’s citizenship and established the civil rights of all citizens. This proposal also found a foe in President Johnson. In his message to Congress announcing that the amendment had been sent to the states for consideration, Johnson questioned the legitimacy of the process and made clear his administration’s disapproval.\nI deem it proper to observe that the steps taken by Secretary of State, as detailed in the accompanying report, are to be considered as purely ministerial, and in no sense whatever committing the Executive to an approval or a recommendation of the amendment to the State legislatures or to the people.52 A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents, Vol. 5 (Washington, D.C.: Bureau of National Literature, 1897), 3590.\nBefore the Fourteenth Amendment could become an enforceable part of the Constitution, 28 of the 37 states had to ratify it. Likely emboldened by Johnson’s defiant message of opposition, Southern legislatures refused—10 of the 11 former Confederate states rejected the amendment with overwhelming majorities and Louisiana did so unanimously.53 Foner, Reconstruction, 269. The amendment fell short of the required state ratifications and could not yet be adopted.\nIn response, and again over President Johnson’s veto, Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867, imposing military rule on the South and requiring states seeking readmission to the Union to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment.54 Ibid.\nThe Reconstruction Acts also established voting rights for African American men, dramatically altering the South’s political landscape. By July 1868, enough states had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and it was adopted. The United States Constitution now declared all persons born in the country were citizens, regardless of race, and thus entitled to the “privileges and immunities” of citizenship, due process, and equal protection under the law.55 U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Two years later, in 1870, the United States ratified the Fifteenth Amendment, explicitly prohibiting racial discrimination in voting56 U.S. Const. amend. XV.—but leaving women of all races disenfranchised for another 50 years.57 The 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified and adopted on August 18, 1920, established the voting rights of American women. In practice, the vast majority of Black men and women remained disenfranchised well into the 20th century due to racially-discriminatory state laws and policies in the South, and federal non-enforcement of the 15th Amendment. Black voting rights did not become widespread reality in America until, nearly a century after the 15th Amendment’s passage, and in response to mass movements led by a new generation of Black civil rights activists and organizers, Congress in 1965 passed the Voting Rights Act. See Henry Louis Gates Jr., Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy and the Rise of Jim Crow(New York: Penguin Press, 2019). Together, these legal developments established the meaning of citizenship for Black people who, just a few years earlier, had been denied that status by the nation’s highest court.\nIn Dred Scott v. Sandford in 1857, the Supreme Court declared Black people born in the United States ineligible for national citizenship and unable to claim the rights and immunities guaranteed by the Constitution.\nNow, little more than a decade later and following the national upheaval of civil war and political reconstruction, the nation for the first time beheld a new legal creation: the Black American. Throughout the country, Black men, women, and children—some of whom had been free for generations and others who were enslaved until very recently—were for the first time legally protected from racialized enslavement, recognized as United States citizens, and legally guaranteed the rights of that status.\nPolitical participation, education, and economic advancement soon emerged as the immediate goals and most powerful symbols of freedom. Those also proved to be the earliest targets of overwhelming post-Emancipation racial violence.\nAcknowledgments\nThis report is written, researched, designed, and produced by the Equal Justice Initiative.

The mythbusters at Snopes.com, in a recently updated review, state that the line, which Carson is reported to have used before, have little evidence to back up that it came from Stalin. The CNN Reality Check team rated its attribution to Stalin as “false.”\nThat more familiar version, which quotes Stalin as saying, “America is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold: its patriotism, its morality, and its spiritual life. If we can undermine these three areas, America will collapse from within,” cannot be found in any of a number of voluminous online libraries, according to Snopes. The oldest account of it, in a letter to the editor of the Lawrence Journal-World, comes from 1983 – three decades after Stalin died.\n“We have yet to find a presentation of this quotation that references a verifiable source for it,” the Snopes sleuths write. “Nearly all reproductions of this quotation simply offer it as an undated, unsourced statement attributed to Stalin.”\nIn an email, the campaign told CNN it was “not sure the actual or original source on which Dr. Carson found it.”\nOn social media, Carson’s line was met first with curiosity and doubt – then mockery, while conservative writers were immediately suspicious.\nThe New York Times columnist Ross Douthat asked for a fact check, while National Review senior editor Ramesh Ponnuru wrote, “I do not have to check to know that Stalin quote from Carson is made up.”\nOnce the dubious provenance of the quote became a point of fun, the jokes came rolling in.\nJason O.

After years of Republicans comparing Barack Obama to Hitler, we now know that the GOP is our only hope against a rival totalitarian dictator: Joseph Stalin.\nAnd, really, it’s only fair. Hitler has been dead for 71 years, while Stalin has only been (intermittently) buried for 62. It’s the Republican brand of progress: giving the younger dead a chance.\nFor Russia watchers, this is exciting news. When Carson invoked Stalin during his closing speech at the debate, our ears perked up: finally, our historical expertise will have its moment! There is only one problem: Stalin never said the words attributed to him by Carson.\nThe Truth Is (Way) Out There\nFortunately, it turns out that Carson’s use of this fake quote is far more interesting than any real Stalin quote could have been. The words Stalin never said actually demonstrate how close American fringe discourse is to that of their fellow tinfoil-hat-wearers in the Russian-speaking world. Both Russian and American conspiracy theorists are obsessed with the idea that external and internal enemies are wearing away at the moral fabric of their respective countries.\nFirst, let’s look at Carson’s quote:\nIt was Joseph Stalin who I guess put it very succinctly. He said, ‘In order to destroy America … you have to undermine three principles: their spiritual life, their patriotism, and their morality. And he said, ‘If you can undermine those things, America will collapse from within.’ Well, we’re within the process of collapsing from within if we continue to accept deceit and dirty tricks and lies. And people who do that are still viable candidates for president of the United States. And we accept it. That’s the problem that’s going on.\nThese words (which apparently come from a popular meme in the right-wing blogosphere) would warm the hearts of a Russian conspiracy-monger, because all you have to do is change the name of the country in question to come up with a very familiar Russian wingnut sentiment that has moved further and further into the mainstream. As Alexander Fokin points out on Facebook, the Stalin quote sounds as though it were lifted from one of the most popular Russian conspiratorial ideas: the so-called Dulles Plan.\nThe Dulles Plan is not my personal favorite out of all the myths about how Americans and/or Jews have been plotting Russia’s downfall: the Harvard Project, in which a cabal of Ivy League Jewish homosexuals schemed to bring down the Soviet Union by ruining the population’s gene pool and turning them gay, will always hold a special place in my heart.\nBut the Dulles Plan has a much broader reach. Like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Dulles Plan started out as fiction only to be transformed into (you should pardon the expression) “fact.” In Anatoly Ivanov’s novel The Eternal Call (1971-1976; 1981), one of the villains delivers a speech that, word for word, ends up attributed to former CIA Director Allen Dulles a decade later:\nWhen the war ends, everything will work itself out. And we will throw everything we’ve got, everything we own: all the gold, all the material strength on turning people into idiots! The human brain, people’s consciousness are all capable of change. After we seed chaos in them, we will imperceptibly switch out their values for false ones and make them believe in these false values! How, you ask? How?\n[…]\nWe’ll find like-minded people: our allies and our helpers in Russia itself!\nIn Russia, the Dulles Plan was a pre-digital Internet meme, from back in the days when memes had to walk twenty miles in the freezing cold before finding a gullible host to infect. As in America, some of these hosts are famous and influential: the Oscar-winning film director Nikita Mikhalkov, and Russia’s answer to Donald Trump (before Donald Trump was ever a question), the scandalous and entertaining parliamentarian clown named Vladimir Zhirinovsky.\nConspiracy theories are notoriously omnivorous. If you follows the lead long enough, then of course you discover that the Jews and the Masons are working for the underground lizard people and their allies, the rectal-probing aliens. But Carson’s brief Stalinist moment is a reminder of something even more important. To paraphrase Leo Tolstoy, a decidedly un-conspiratorial Russian classic: All conspiracy theories are alike; each theory of complexity and nuance is complex and nuanced in its own way.\nReally, the convergence of Ben Carson and Russian lunatics is rather heartwarming: it reminds us of the common humanity (and common insanity) that disregards all national borders.\nConspiracy theorists of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your grasp on reality.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Summary\nThe ninth GOP debate featured the top six remaining candidates for the party’s presidential nomination. They repeated several false and misleading claims, and made some new ones, too.\n- Sen. Ted Cruz claimed that “we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year.” That’s wrong. Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed in 1988, an election year.\n- Businessman Donald Trump called Cruz the “single biggest liar” for saying Trump “supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.” But Trump did leave open the possibility of funding some aspects before later saying he wouldn’t support funding as long as the group performed abortions.\n- Sen. Marco Rubio said that illegal immigration “is worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago.” The estimated number of immigrants in the country illegally has remained stable over that time.\n- Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson attributed a quote to Joseph Stalin that experts say didn’t come from the Soviet dictator.\n- Trump falsely claimed that a failed eminent domain case to benefit a Trump casino project in 1998 “wasn’t for a parking lot.” It was.\n- Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush conflated two Trump quotes in claiming Trump called Sen. John McCain a “loser because he was a P.O.W.” Trump said he was a loser, because he lost the 2008 presidential election.\n- Trump claimed that the nation’s economy “didn’t grow” in the last quarter. It did grow, by a small amount.\n- Trump repeated his claim that he is a self-funded candidate. Not entirely. His money makes up 66 percent of his campaign’s money through the end of 2015. The rest comes from individual donors.\nAnd there were several other repeated claims we’ve fact-checked before on jobs, taxes, immigration and regulation.\nAnalysis\nThe debate was held in Greenville, South Carolina, and moderated by John Dickerson of CBS News. Participating were: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and businessman Donald Trump. It was the first Republican debate since New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina ended their presidential campaigns.\nAn Election-Year Supreme Court Confirmation\nDickerson asked the candidates if, given the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, President Obama should use his constitutional authority to name a replacement justice this year.\nCruz claimed that “we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year.” That’s wrong.\nPresident Ronald Reagan nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy to the high court on Nov. 30, 1987, and Kennedy was confirmed by the Senate on Feb. 3, 1988, by a vote of 97-0. That was the same year that George H.W. Bush was elected to succeed Reagan as president.\nKennedy was actually Reagan’s third nominee to replace retiring Justice Lewis Powell. Robert Bork, who Reagan nominated on July 1, 1987, was rejected by a vote of 42-58 on Oct. 23, 1987. And Douglas Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration in early November 1987, after acknowledging that he had smoked marijuana several times.\nWhen Dickerson pointed out that Kennedy was confirmed in 1988, Cruz said, “No, Kennedy was confirmed in ’87.” But Dickerson was right and Cruz was wrong.\nThat also makes Rubio’s claim that “it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice” problematic.\nIf Rubio considers Obama to be a “lame duck president,” meaning his time as president will soon be over, the same could be said of Reagan, who nominated a replacement justice well into his second and final term as president.\nTrump’s Position on Planned Parenthood\nWhen Cruz said Trump “supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood,” Trump responded that Cruz was the “single biggest liar.” Trump said in August that he didn’t support funding abortions performed by Planned Parenthood but he left open the possibility of funding other aspects of the group’s work on women’s health.\nIn early September, however, Trump said, “I wouldn’t do any funding as long as they are performing abortions.”\nHere’s part of the disagreement between the two candidates in the debate:\nTrump: Where did I support?\nCruz: You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood. You went on…\nTrump: That’s a lot of lies.\nCruz: You said, “Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it.”\nTrump: It does do wonderful things but not as it relates to abortion.\nCruz: So I’ll tell you what…\nTrump: Excuse me. Excuse me, there are wonderful things having to do with women’s health.\nCruz: You see you and I…\nTrump: But not when it comes to abortion.\nIn an Aug. 11, 2015, interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, Trump said, “Well, the biggest problem I have with Planned Parenthood is the abortion situation. It’s like an abortion factory frankly. You can’t have it and it shouldn’t be funding and that should not be funded by the government. I feel strongly about that.”\nHe went on to say, “What I would do is look at the individual things that they do and maybe some of the things are good, I know a lot of things are bad. But certainly the abortion aspect of it should not be funded by government.”\nCuomo followed up, asking, “So you would take a look at it before you defund it. That’s what is being asked for right now. Many in your party are doing the opposite. They are saying defund it and then look at it. You’d say look at it first.”\nTrump responded: “I would look at the good aspects of it. I would also look as I’m sure they do some things properly and good and good for women. I would look at that. I would look at other aspects also, but we have to take care of women. We have to absolutely take care of women. The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should not be funded.”\nSo, Trump did not say he supported cutting off all federal funding to Planned Parenthood, as other Republicans, including Cruz, have done. He did say that abortions performed by Planned Parenthood shouldn’t be funded. (For the record, federal funding for abortion is restricted by the Hyde Amendment to only abortion cases involving rape, incest or endangerment to the life of the mother.)\nBut, as CNN wrote in a headline on the Trump interview, he has waffled on this issue. A week earlier, on Aug. 4, 2015, radio host Hugh Hewitt asked whether Trump would support shutting down the government in an attempt to cut off federal funding to Planned Parenthood. Trump responded: “I would.”\nTrump has made other conflicting statements. Also on Aug. 11, in an interview with Fox News when asked whether taxpayers should give Planned Parenthood a penny since it performs abortions, Trump said that abortion services was a small part of what the group did and that it provided important services to women (starting at the 5:50 mark).\nTrump, Aug. 11, Fox News: Let’s say there’s two Planned Parenthoods in a way. You have it as an abortion clinic. Now that’s actually a fairly small part of what they do, but it’s a brutal part and I’m totally against it and I wouldn’t do that. They also however service women. …\nWe have to help women. A lot of women are helped. We have to look at the positives, also, for Planned Parenthood.\nTrump left open the possibility of cutting off funding unless the group stops performing abortions, saying, “Maybe unless they stop with the abortions, we don’t do the funding for the stuff that we want. There are many ways you can do that.”\nBut then in another Fox News interview on Sept. 8 with Bill O’Reilly, Trump took a harder line and denied that he supported funding the group: “No, I mean a lot of people say it’s an abortion clinic. I’m opposed to that. And I wouldn’t do any funding as long as they are performing abortions. And they are performing abortions. So I would be opposed to funding — I would be totally opposed to funding,” Trump said.\nRubio Wrong on Illegal Immigration\nRubio said that illegal immigration “is worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago.” It has remained pretty flat in that time.\nThere were 11.3 million people living in the U.S. illegally in 2014. That’s the most recent estimate from the Pew Research Center. That is lower than the 11.5 million the center estimated were living in the U.S. illegally three years earlier in 2011, and the same as the 11.3 million in 2009.\nOverall, “[t]his population has remained essentially stable for five years after nearly two decades of changes,” Pew said in its July 2015 report.\nStalin Didn’t Say That\nIn his closing statement, Carson attributed a quote to Joseph Stalin that experts say didn’t come from the Soviet dictator.\n“Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality,” Carson said. “We, the people, can stop that decline, starting right here in South Carolina.”\nThe Internet myth-busters at Snopes.com looked into the quote when it made the rounds as a Facebook meme (the exact quote attributed to Stalin then was, “America is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold: its patriotism, its morality, and its spiritual life. If we can undermine these three areas, America will collapse from within.”). Snopes searched collections of Stalin’s speeches, writings, interviews and other statements and was unable to turn up any reference to that quote. Snopes also noted that none of the numerous citations on the Internet referenced a verifiable source for the quote.\nAfter the debate, we reached out to David Brandenberger, an associate professor of history and international studies at the University of Richmond, who has written extensively about Stalin, and he told us the quote is bogus.\n“Indeed, the only thing more remarkable than Carson quoting Stalin at the debate was that he attributed to him a made-up quotation,” Brandenberger told us via email. “Of course, Stalin is often credited with apocryphal statements (‘Death is the solution to all problems. No man – no problem,’ etc.), but that doesn’t excuse Carson tonight.”\nStanford history professor Norman Naimark, who holds the Robert and Florence McDonnell Chair in East European History and wrote “Stalin’s Genocides,” told us he has never heard of that quote from Stalin either. “I suspect Carson made it up, but I don’t know for sure,” Naimark told us.\nTrump/Bush on Eminent Domain\nTrump and Bush once again argued over New Jersey’s failed attempts to use eminent domain to benefit a Trump casino project in Atlantic City. But, in defending himself, Trump misrepresented the case.\nTrump falsely claimed that the eminent domain case “wasn’t for a parking lot,” but rather for “a very large tower” that would “employ thousands.” But the eminent domain case was for a parking lot. A “very large tower” was not part of the condemnation proceedings, but there was a proposed hotel renovation that would have been accomplished through a private sale.\nTrump: When Jeb had said, “You used eminent domain privately for a parking lot.” It wasn’t for a parking lot. The state of New Jersey — too bad Chris Christie is not here, he could tell you — the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people. I mean, it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development.\nHere are the facts, as we have reported once before: The state Casino Reinvestment Development Authority attempted to condemn three parcels of land in Atlantic City as part of a $28.6 million hotel project proposed by Trump Plaza Associates. The properties were owned separately by three families with the last names Banin, Coking and Sabatini.\nHere’s how a state court judge, in ruling against the state and Trump in 1998, described Trump’s proposal and the three properties that the state wanted to condemn to complete it:\nCasino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Banin, July 20, 1998: Trump’s project called for the redevelopment of the city block abutting the boardwalk between the Trump Plaza Hotel-Casino and Caesars Hotel-Casino. The block was located in the Corridor Area which was an area previously identified by CRDA for redevelopment. The site was occupied by the former Holiday Inn Hotel, the rusting steel structure of the aborted Penthouse Hotel-Casino project, some undeveloped lots and a few private residences and small businesses. Included within the site were the properties of defendants Banin, Coking and Sabatini.\nTrump’s project proposed creation of a 361-room hotel by rehabilitation of the Holiday Inn building; removal of the dilapidated Penthouse steel structure; construction of surface parking and a driveway bisecting the block from Missouri Avenue to the entrance of the Trump Plaza Hotel; and creation of a park or privately-owned landscaped area along Pacific Avenue. The project also called for construction of a two-story porte-cochere at the Trump Plaza entrance spanning Columbia Place, the public street between Trump Plaza and the site, as well as linkage of the renovated hotel to Trump Plaza by way of a sky bridge over Columbia Place near the Boardwalk.\nSuperior Court Judge Richard Williams wrote in his opinion that the “parcels in the area proposed for the driveway, surface parking, and the landscaped park area were held by other owners. Because Trump had previously been unable to acquire these privately-owned parcels, CRDA was requested to use its power of eminent domain for their acquisition.”\nWilliams wrote that under Trump’s plan “Coking’s property [would] be blacktopped and used for surface parking and Banin and Sabatini’s properties would be planted with grass and used for a park or green space.”\nIt was Vera Coking who was featured in a Cruz ad attacking Trump for seeking to bulldoze Coking’s home “for a limousine parking lot for his casino.” As the Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 1998, Trump proposed “a limousine waiting area” on Coking’s property.\nSo, while Trump can make the argument that his project would have created jobs, he cannot say that the eminent domain case “wasn’t for a parking lot.” It was for a parking lot and public park to complete the project.\nDid Trump Call McCain a ‘Loser’?\nIn a pointed exchange, Bush claimed Trump once called Sen. John McCain a “loser because he was a P.O.W.” Trump called McCain a loser, but not because he was a prisoner of war. He called him a “loser” because he lost the 2008 presidential election to Barack Obama.\nIn the debate, Bush said, “And, it’s really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a P.O.W.”\n“I never called him — I don’t call him,” Trump responded.\n“That is outrageous,” Bush continued. “The guy’s an American hero.”\nThere are two Trump quotes in question here. And Bush was conflating them.\nAt the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, in July, Trump said of McCain, “He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” In comments to the media after his speech, Trump seemed to walk that back a bit, saying, “If somebody’s a prisoner, I consider them a war hero.”\nIn the same speech, Trump also took a shot at McCain for losing the 2008 presidential race to Barack Obama.\n“He lost,” Trump said. “He let us down. I never liked him as much after that because I don’t like losers.”\nGDP Growth\nTrump claimed that the nation’s economy “didn’t grow” in the last quarter. It did grow, although fourth-quarter growth was weak.\nTrump: We have an economy that last quarter, GDP didn’t grow. It was flat. We have to make our economy grow again.\nIn a Jan. 29 press release, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said the nation’s gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, the U.S. economy grew by 2.4 percent — the same as 2014, BEA said.\nNot Entirely Self-Funded\nTrump repeated his claim that he is a “self-funder” when it comes to funding his campaign. Not completely, he isn’t.\nTrump’s presidential campaign received $19.4 million in 2015, according to Trump’s year-end filing with the Federal Election Commission in January. Trump loaned his campaign $12.6 million of that amount, and he made additional in-kind contributions of $219,000. So, nearly 66 percent of the campaign’s money has come from Trump. The other 34 percent, or $6.5 million, has come from individual donors.\nWe should also note that since Trump has loaned that money to his campaign, rather than donating it, he could potentially get it back. The individual donations that the campaign has received are enough to cover about half of the campaign’s $12.4 million in spending as of Dec. 31, 2015.\nIt’s Groundhog Day All Over Again\nGroundhog Day was less than two weeks ago, but watching the Republican debate felt a bit like that for us at FactCheck.org — we have seen many of the same misleading claims crop up again and again. Here are some of the repeat claims we heard:\n- Cruz: “The business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT [Value-Added Tax]. A VAT in Europe is a sales tax.” As we wrote when this came up during the sixth Republican debate, the nonpartisan, business-funded Tax Foundation has described the Cruz proposal as a “subtraction method value-added tax,” and the conservative National Review also describes it as a VAT.\n- Bush: “The Cato Institute, which grades governors based on their spending, rank [Kasich] right at the bottom.” We wrote about this recently after ads from the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise cited Cato Institute’s 2014 “Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors,” in which it gave Kasich an overall “D” rating and rated him worst among all governors on spending. We noted that the rating is based on data about Ohio’s general revenue fund spending, but the nonpartisan group that published the data warned that the figures for Ohio were skewed, for state comparison purposes, due to accounting methods employed by the state for Medicaid expenditures.\n- Bush: “We led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years” when he was governor of Florida. Bush has twisted jobs data a few different ways during the campaign, and this time his campaign says he is referring to the total number of jobs created in the last seven years of his governorship. As we noted last June, Florida gained more net jobs than any other state, regardless of size, in three of the eight years Bush was governor. But when it comes to the rate of job growth — which factors in the size of the state’s job market – Florida ranked fifth over the entire eight years of Bush’s two terms.\n- Cruz: “Marco [Rubio] went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama’s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.” As we explained when Cruz made a similar charge on two Sunday talk shows on Jan. 31, Rubio said he wouldn’t immediately revoke Obama’s 2012 order protecting so-called “Dreamers” — young people brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents — though he said it would have to end “at some point.” But Rubio has said he would revoke Obama’s 2014 executive action that protects as many as 5 million adults from deportation.\n- Rubio: “And here is the truth, Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country illegally.” We’ve covered this one repeatedly, as it has come up in multiple debates. We covered the issue in detail after the fifth Republican debate, and the gist of it is that Cruz offered an amendment to a Senate immigration bill to strip it of a path to citizenship — although it would have left open the possibility of legalization. Cruz spoke many times in favor of his amendment, advocating its passage, but Cruz’s campaign says that was a political bluff to show that the real aim of the bill’s supporters was a path to citizenship, and that he never actually supported legalization.\n- Carson: “You know, when you consider how much regulations cost us each year, you know? $2 trillion dollars per family, $24,000 per family.” We last wrote about this when then Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said in February 2015 that the cost of government regulation “hits American families for $15,000 a year.” That figure comes from a conservative group’s admitted “back-of-the-envelope” calculation of estimated regulatory costs that does not include any potential savings. The Competitive Enterprise Institute has released a newer version of the report cited by Perry, but the same shortcomings apply.\n- Rubio: “Well, first of all, I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that — I’ve never supported that.” We wrote about Rubio’s evolution on immigration, as well as his evolving definition of amnesty back in 2013. In that story, we noted that in 2011, Rubio derided an “earned path to citizenship” as another word for “amnesty.”\n- Kasich: “We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private-sector jobs since I’ve been governor.” As we wrote when Kasich made a similar boast in the seventh GOP debate, Ohio has, in fact, gained 400,700 private-sector jobs under Kasich. Still, Ohio’s private-sector job growth rate of 9.3 percent during Kasich’s tenure lags behind the national private-sector growth rate of 11.7 percent.\n— by Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley, Lori Robertson and D’Angelo Gore\nSources\nSenate Historical Office.

The space agency gave them a combined $50 million to design the transportation technologies of the future. Until then, NASA would pay Russia to send American astronauts to their shared home above Earth, the International Space Station.\nOn Wednesday, some of the people involved in this partnership convened on Capitol Hill to face lawmakers and provide an update on their progress.\nOn one end of the table sat Bill Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA, who gave a positive picture of the partnership, known as the Commercial Crew Program, as it’s going right now.\n“This is a critical time in the program as manufacturing is in high gear, testing is being completed, and verification and validation requirements are being addressed by NASA,” he said. “The program is approximately one year away from the first crewed flights to ISS.”\nOn the other end of the table was Cristina Chaplain, the director at the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) who has overseen multiple reviews of the Commercial Crew Program. Her testimony included some bad news on the effort to restore the country’s astronaut-launching capabilities.\nSpaceX and Boeing, the two companies NASA ended up hiring to develop space transportation, may send a human crew on a test flight to the International Space Station in 2019, yes, but they would then need to undergo and pass rigorous safety tests—and the timeline for that is slipping. The companies’ contracts with NASA, established in 2014, had called for passing final certification tests in 2017. Based on a new GAO report released Wednesday, SpaceX may not get certified for regular flights to the ISS until December 2019, and Boeing until February 2020. The companies have a “considerable amount of work” to do to meet safety standards, Chaplain noted.\n“Aggressive schedules and delays are not atypical for programs developing new launch vehicles or crew vehicles,” Chaplain said. “But in this case, the delays and final certification dates raise questions about whether the United States will have uninterrupted access to the space station beyond 2019.”\nIn between Gerstenmaier and Chaplain sat representatives for SpaceX and Boeing. Hans Koenigsmann, a SpaceX vice president, and John Mulholland, a Boeing vice president, both assured the members of Congress at the hearing that their companies would be ready to meet this demand on time.\nBut the GAO report suggests a different story, and Wednesday’s hearing, held by the House Subcommittee on Space, began with some sharp words from the subcommittee’s chairman about the report’s prediction of more delays.\nBrian Babin, a Republican congressman from Texas, said SpaceX and Boeing are “behind schedule, may not meet safety and reliability requirements, and could even slip into cost overruns.”\n“Both companies are making progress, but certainly not at the rate that was expected and not without significant challenges to safety and reliability,” Babin said. “In order to remedy these problems, NASA may seek additional funding or accept significant risks. Neither of those options is viable.”\nThe Commercial Crew Program has been plagued with delays since its inception. NASA’s initial target date of 2015 was pushed to 2017, and then again to mid-2018. Last week, NASA announced some more delays: Un-crewed demonstrations by both SpaceX and Boeing are now scheduled to take place in August, and crewed flights are expected to follow in November and December.\n“The work completed took longer than originally planned, but many technical issues were discovered and resolved,” Gerstenmaier told the subcommittee. “This extra time that was taken in this development phase will help reduce the risk and magnitude of additional scheduled delays.”\nChaplain said SpaceX and Boeing have reported delays nine and six times, respectively, since NASA awarded them a combined $6.8 billion to work on crew transportation systems. She said both companies are currently working on addressing some safety problems. Boeing is trying to figure out how to prevent its spacecraft, the CST-100 Starliner, from tumbling during some mission-abort scenarios, which could threaten the safety of the crew. The company is also investigating the possibility that the spacecraft’s heat shield would damage the parachute system during reentry into Earth’s atmosphere. SpaceX, meanwhile, is trying to address safety concerns from NASA safety advisory boards about fueling its Dragon spacecraft while astronauts are inside.\nRight now, the United States pays between $70 million and $80 million per seat for a ride on Russian Soyuz spacecrafts to the ISS. And the government has bought a couple more rides through 2019, just in case delays of the Commercial Crew Program continue. After that, if SpaceX or Boeing still aren’t ready to fly, NASA may be out of luck. If the space agency wanted to attempt to buy seats from Russia then, it may need to wait until new Soyuz launch vehicles are assembled and built, a process that takes three years.\nAt some point, the race between SpaceX and Boeing to test their crew capsules becomes a race that pits the two companies, together, against time. The United States and its international partners are committed to operating the station only through 2024. If the start of regular flight operations slips even further—from late 2019 and early 2020, as GAO now predicts, into later in the 2020s—the very purpose of this effort would be at stake. NASA has already picked the astronauts that will participate in the test flights of commercial transportation systems. Should delays continue or worsen, these astronauts may find themselves all dressed up with nowhere to go.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        I just found this:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4537748.stmA show in 2005 that tricked contestants into believing that they were flying to a Russian space station.

Tourists are motivated by the possibility of viewing Earth from space, feeling weightlessness, experiencing extremely high speed and something unusual, and contributing to science.[2]\nSpace tourism started in April 2001, when American businessman and engineer Dennis Tito became the first ever space tourist to travel to space aboard a Soyuz-TM32 spacecraft. During the period from 2001 to 2009, seven space tourists made eight space flights aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station, brokered by American company Space Adventures in conjunction with Roscosmos and RSC Energia. Iranian-American businesswoman Anousheh Ansari became the first ever female space tourist in September 2006. The publicized price was in the range of US$20–25 million per trip. Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit. By 2007, space tourism was thought to be one of the earliest markets that would emerge for commercial spaceflight.[3]: 11\nSpace tourists need to be in good physical form before going to space. In particular, they have to train for fast acceleration or g-forces in a centrifuge and weightlessness by flying in a high-altitude jet plane doing parabolic arcs. They may have to learn how to operate and even fix parts of the spaceship using simulators.\nRussia halted orbital space tourism in 2010 due to the increase in the International Space Station crew size, using the seats for expedition crews that would previously have been sold to paying spaceflight participants.[4][5] Orbital tourist flights were set to resume in 2015 but the planned flight was postponed indefinitely.[6] Russian orbital tourism eventually resumed with the launch of Soyuz MS-20 in 2021.[7]\nOn June 7, 2019, NASA announced that starting in 2020, the organization aims to start allowing private astronauts to go on the International Space Station, with the use of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft and the Boeing Starliner spacecraft for public astronauts, which is planned to be priced at 35,000 USD per day for one astronaut,[8] and an estimated 50 million USD for the ride there and back.[9]\nWork also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. SpaceX announced in 2018 that they are planning on sending space tourists, including Yusaku Maezawa, on a free-return trajectory around the Moon on the Starship,[10][11] however the project was cancelled on June 1, 2024.[citation needed]\nPrecursors\n[edit]The Soviet space program was successful in broadening the pool of cosmonauts. The Soviet Intercosmos program included cosmonauts selected from Warsaw Pact member countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and non-aligned countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but were generally given shorter flights than Soviet cosmonauts. The European Space Agency (ESA) also took advantage of the program.[citation needed][12]\nThe US Space Shuttle program included payload specialist positions which were usually filled by representatives of companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission. These payload specialists did not receive the same training as professional NASA astronauts and were not employed by NASA. In 1983, Ulf Merbold from the ESA and Byron Lichtenberg from MIT (engineer and Air Force fighter pilot) were the first payload specialists to fly on the Space Shuttle, on mission STS-9.[13][14]\nIn 1984, Charles D. Walker became the first non-government astronaut to fly, with his employer McDonnell Douglas paying US$40,000 (equivalent to $121,063 in 2024) for his flight.[15]: 74–75 During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International studied a $200–300 million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttle's cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the National Space Society stated that, although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 million to $1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years, 30,000 people a year would pay US$25,000 (equivalent to $73,089 in 2024) each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to lunar orbit within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.[16]\nAs the shuttle program expanded in the early 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. Christa McAuliffe was chosen as the first Teacher in Space in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle. After McAuliffe was killed in the Challenger disaster in January 1986, the programs were cancelled. McAuliffe's backup, Barbara Morgan, eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on STS-118 as a mission specialist.[15]: 84–85 A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted Miles O'Brien to fly on the Space Shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was cancelled in the wake of the Columbia disaster on STS-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the Space Shuttle.[citation needed]\nInitially, senior figures at NASA strongly opposed space tourism on principle; from the beginning of the ISS expeditions, NASA stated it was not interested in accommodating paying guests.[17] The Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Committee on Science of the House of Representatives held in June 2001 revealed the shifting attitude of NASA towards paying space tourists wanting to travel to the ISS in its statement on the hearing's purpose:\n\"Review the issues and opportunities for flying nonprofessional astronauts in space, the appropriate government role for supporting the nascent space tourism industry, use of the Shuttle and Space Station for Tourism, safety and training criteria for space tourists, and the potential commercial market for space tourism.\"\nThe subcommittee report was interested in evaluating Dennis Tito's extensive training and his experience in space as a nonprofessional astronaut.[citation needed]\nWith the realities of the post-Perestroika economy in Russia, its space industry was especially starved for cash. The Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) offered to pay for one of its reporters to fly on a mission. Toyohiro Akiyama was flown in 1990 to Mir with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew. Cost estimates vary from $10 million up to $37 million.[18][19] Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies.\nIn 1991, British chemist Helen Sharman was selected from a pool of 13,000 applicants to be the first Briton in space.[20] The program was known as Project Juno and was a cooperative arrangement between the Soviet Union and a group of British companies. The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the funds required, and the program was almost cancelled. Reportedly Mikhail Gorbachev ordered it to proceed under Soviet expense in the interests of international relations, but in the absence of Western underwriting, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans. Sharman flew aboard Soyuz TM-12 to Mir and returned aboard Soyuz TM-11.[21]\nIn April 1999, the Russian space agency announced that 51-year-old British billionaire Peter Llewellyn would be sent to the aging Mir space station in return for a payment of $100 million by Llewellyn.[22] Llewellyn, however, denied agreeing to pay that sum, his refusal to pay which prompted his flight's cancellation a month later.[23]\nSub-orbital space tourism\n[edit]Successful projects\n[edit]- Scaled Composites won the $10 million X Prize in October 2004 with SpaceShipOne, as the first private company to reach and surpass an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) twice within two weeks. The altitude is beyond the Kármán Line, the arbitrarily defined boundary of space.[24] The first flight was flown by Michael Melvill in June 2004, to a height of 100 km (62 mi), making him the first commercial astronaut.[25] The prize-winning flight was flown by Brian Binnie, which reached a height of 112.0 km (69.6 mi), breaking the X-15 record.[26] There were no space tourists on the flights even though the vehicle has seats for three passengers. Instead there was additional weight to make up for the weight of passengers.[27]\n- In 2005, Virgin Galactic was founded as a joint venture between Scaled Composites and Richard Branson's Virgin Group.[28] Eventually Virgin Group owned the entire project.[29] Virgin Galactic began building SpaceShipTwo-class spaceplanes. The first of these spaceplanes, VSS Enterprise, was intended to commence its first commercial flights in 2015, and tickets were on sale at a price of $200,000 (later raised to $250,000). However, the company suffered a considerable setback when the Enterprise broke up over the Mojave Desert during a test flight in October 2014. Over 700 tickets had been sold prior to the accident.[30] A second spaceplane, VSS Unity, completed a successful test flight with four passengers on July 11, 2021, to an altitude of nearly 90 km (56 mi).[31] Galactic 01 became the company's first commercial spaceflight on June 29, 2023.[32]\n- Blue Origin developed the New Shepard reusable suborbital launch system specifically to enable short-duration space tourism. Blue Origin plans to ferry a maximum of six persons on a brief journey to space on board the New Shepard. The capsule is attached to the top portion of an 18-meter (59-foot) rocket. The rocket successfully launched with four passengers on July 20, 2021, and reached an altitude of 107 km (66 mi).[33] Blue Origin's 10th human flight lifted off on the morning of February 25, 2025. Six paying passengers, including a Spanish TV host, and several investors, experienced weightlessness during the 10-12-minute flight and can see Earth against the blackness of space.[34]\nCancelled projects\n[edit]- Armadillo Aerospace was developing a two-seat vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) rocket called Hyperion, which will be marketed by Space Adventures.[35] Hyperion uses a capsule similar in shape to the Gemini capsule. The vehicle will use a parachute for descent but will probably use retrorockets for final touchdown, according to remarks made by Armadillo Aerospace at the Next Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference in February 2012. The assets of Armadillo Aerospace were sold to Exos Aerospace and while SARGE is continuing to be developed, it is unclear whether Hyperion is still being developed.\n- XCOR Aerospace was developing a suborbital vehicle called Lynx until development was halted in May 2016.[36] The Lynx would take off from a runway under rocket power. Unlike SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, Lynx would not require a mothership. Lynx was designed for rapid turnaround, which would enable it to fly up to four times per day. Because of this rapid flight rate, Lynx had fewer seats than SpaceShipTwo, carrying only one pilot and one spaceflight participant on each flight. XCOR expected to roll out the first Lynx prototype and begin flight tests in 2015, but as of late 2017, XCOR was unable to complete their prototype development and filed for bankruptcy.[37]\n- Citizens in Space, formerly the Teacher in Space Project, is a project of the United States Rocket Academy. Citizens in Space combines citizen science with citizen space exploration. The goal is to fly citizen-science experiments and citizen explorers (who travel free) who will act as payload operators on suborbital space missions. By 2012, Citizens in Space had acquired a contract for 10 suborbital flights with XCOR Aerospace and expected to acquire additional flights from XCOR and other suborbital spaceflight providers in the future. In 2012, Citizens in Space reported they had begun training three citizen astronaut candidates and would select seven additional candidates over the next 12 to 14 months.[38][needs update]\n- Space Expedition Corporation was preparing to use the Lynx for \"Space Expedition Curaçao\", a commercial flight from Hato Airport on Curaçao, and planned to start commercial flights in 2014. The costs were $95,000 each.[39][40]\n- Axe Apollo Space Academy promotion by Unilever which planned to provide 23 people suborbital spaceflights on board the Lynx.\n- EADS Astrium, a subsidiary of European aerospace giant EADS, announced its space tourism project in June 2007.[41]\nOrbital space tourism\n[edit]As of 2021, Space Adventures and SpaceX are the only companies to have coordinated tourism flights to Earth's orbit. Virginia-based Space Adventures has worked with Russia to use its Soyuz spacecraft to fly ultra-wealthy individuals to the International Space Station. The tourists included entrepreneur and space investor Anousheh Ansari and Cirque du Soleil co-founder Guy Laliberté. Those missions were priced at around $20 million each. The space industry could soon be headed for a tourism revolution if SpaceX and Boeing make good on their plans to take tourists to orbit.[42]\nSuccessful projects\n[edit]At the end of the 1990s, MirCorp, a private venture that was by then in charge of the space station, began seeking potential space tourists to visit Mir in order to offset some of its maintenance costs. Dennis Tito, an American businessman and former JPL scientist, became their first candidate. When the decision was made to de-orbit Mir, Tito managed to switch his trip to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft through a deal between MirCorp and US-based Space Adventures, Ltd. Dennis Tito visited the ISS for seven days in April–May 2001, becoming the world's first \"fee-paying\" space tourist. Tito paid a reported $20 million for his trip.[43]\nTito was followed in April 2002 by South African Mark Shuttleworth (Soyuz TM-34). In February 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts aboard. After this disaster, space tourism on the Russian Soyuz program was temporarily put on hold, because Soyuz vehicles became the only available transport to the ISS. After the Shuttle's return to service in July 2005, space tourism was resumed. The third was Gregory Olsen in October 2005 (Soyuz TMA-7). In September 2006, an Iranian American businesswoman named Anousheh Ansari became the fourth space tourist (Soyuz TMA-9).[44]) In April 2007, Charles Simonyi, an American businessman of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks (Soyuz TMA-10). Simonyi became the first repeat space tourist, paying again to fly on Soyuz TMA-14 in March 2009. British-American Richard Garriott became the next space tourist in October 2008 aboard Soyuz TMA-13.[45] Canadian Guy Laliberté visited the ISS in September 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-16, becoming the last visiting tourist until Japanese nationals Yusaku Maezawa and Yozo Hirano aboard Soyuz MS-20 in December 2021. Originally the third member aboard Soyuz TMA-18M would have been the British singer Sarah Brightman as a space tourist, but on May 13, 2015, she announced she had withdrawn from training.[46]\nSince the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, Soyuz once again became the only means of accessing the ISS, and so tourism was once again put on hold. On June 7, 2019, NASA announced a plan to open the ISS to space tourism again.[47]\nOn September 16, 2021, the Inspiration4 mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX Falcon 9 and spent almost three days in orbit aboard the Crew Dragon Resilience, becoming the first all-civilian crew to fly an orbital space mission.[48][49]\nOn September 12, 2024, Jared Isaacman and Sarah Gillis performed the first commercial spacewalk during the Polaris Dawn spaceflight operated by SpaceX.[50]\nOn April 1, 2025, Fram2 became the first crewed spaceflight to enter a polar retrograde orbit,[51] launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.[52]\nOngoing projects\n[edit]- Axiom Space uses Crew Dragon flights contracted with SpaceX to send crews to the International Space Station.[53][54] Mission 1 flew in April 2022, Mission 2 in May 2023, Mission 3 in January 2024, and Mission 4 in June 2025. Through these missions, NASA hopes to create a non-NASA market for human spaceflight to enable cost-sharing on future commercial space stations.\n- The Boeing Starliner capsule is being developed as part of the NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Part of the agreement with NASA allows Boeing to sell seats for space tourists. Boeing proposed including one seat per flight for a spaceflight participant at a price that would be competitive with what Roscosmos charges tourists.[55][56]\n- The Polaris Program: The commander and financier of the Inspiration4 mission, Jared Isaacman, announced plans for a three-mission program called Polaris in February 2022. The first mission, Polaris Dawn, launched four private astronauts in a Crew Dragon spacecraft to earth orbit. Polaris Dawn was a free-flyer mission in which the spacecraft did not perform any rendezvous maneuvers, instead setting the all-time earth orbit altitude record at 1,400 km, surpassing the 1,373 km record set by Gemini XI. Polaris Dawn also included the first private extravehicular activity (EVA). The last Polaris program mission is planned to be the first crewed flight of the in-development Starship launch system.\nCancelled projects\n[edit]- In 2004, Bigelow Aerospace established a competition called America's Space Prize, which offered a $50 million prize to the first US company to create a reusable spacecraft capable of carrying passengers to a Nautilus space station. The prize expired in January 2010 without anyone making a serious effort to win it.[57]\n- The Space Island Group proposed having 20,000 people on their \"space island\" by 2020.[58]\n- A United States startup firm, Orion Span announced during the early part of 2018 that it planned to launch and position a luxury space hotel in orbit within several years.[59] Aurora Space Station, the name of the hotel, would have offered guests (at most six individuals) 12 days of staying in a pill-shaped space hotel for $9.5 million. The hotel's cabins would have measured approximately 12.9 metres (43 feet) by 4.8 metres (14 feet) in width.[60]\n- Space Adventures Crew Dragon mission: Space Adventures and SpaceX planned to send up to four tourists to low Earth orbit for a few days in late 2021 or early 2022. In October 2021, Space Adventures stated that the mission contract had expired, though the possibility of a future partnership with SpaceX was left open.[61]\n- Galactic Suite Design\n- Orbital Technologies Commercial Space Station\n- Space Industries Incorporated\n- Space Islands\nTourism beyond Earth orbit\n[edit]Ongoing projects\n[edit]- A mission with a similar flight profile is planned to have the same flight profile as the now cancelled Dearmoon project, with Dennis Tito and his wife Akiko Tito as two of the passengers.[62]\n- Space Adventures Ltd. have announced that they are working on DSE-Alpha, a circumlunar mission to the Moon, with the price per passenger being $100,000,000.[63]\nCancelled projects\n[edit]- Excalibur Almaz proposed to take three tourists in a flyby around the Moon, using modified Almaz space station modules, in a low-energy trajectory flyby around the Moon. The trip would last around 6 months.[64] However, their equipment was never launched and is to be converted into an educational exhibit.[65]\n- The Golden Spike Company was an American space transport startup active from 2010 to 2013. The company held the objective to offer private commercial space transportation services to the surface of the Moon. The company's website was quietly taken offline in September 2015.\n- The Inspiration Mars Foundation is an American nonprofit organization founded by Dennis Tito that proposed to launch a crewed mission to flyby Mars in January 2018,[66][67][68] or 2021 if they missed the first deadline.[69] Their website became defunct by late 2015 but it is archived by the Internet Archive.[70] The Foundation's future plans are unclear.\n- Bigelow Aerospace planned to extend their successes with the Genesis modules by launching the B330, an expandable habitation module with 330 cubic meters of internal space, aboard a Vulcan rocket. The Vulcan was contracted to boost BA 330 to low lunar orbit by the end of 2022.[71]\n- In February 2017, Elon Musk announced that substantial deposits from two individuals had been received by SpaceX for a Moon loop flight using a free return trajectory and that this could happen as soon as late 2018.[72] Musk said that the cost of the mission would be \"comparable\" to that of sending an astronaut to the International Space Station, about US$70 million in 2017.[73] In February 2018, Musk announced that the Falcon Heavy rocket would not be used for crewed missions.[74][75] The proposal changed in 2018 to use the Starship launch system instead.[11][74][75] In September 2018, Musk revealed the passenger for the trip, Yusaku Maezawa during a livestream. Yusaku Maezawa described the plan for his trip in further detail, dubbed the #dearMoon project, intended to take 6–8 artists with him on the journey to inspire the artists to create new art.\nLegality\n[edit]Under the Outer Space Treaty signed in 1967, the launch operator's nationality and the launch site's location determine which country is responsible for any damages occurred from a launch.[76]\nAfter valuable resources were detected on the Moon, private companies began to formulate methods to extract the resources. Article II of the Outer Space Treaty dictates that \"outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means\".[77] However, countries have the right to freely explore the Moon and any resources collected for scientific purposes are property of that country when they return.\nUnited States\n[edit]In December 2005, the US government released a set of proposed rules for space tourism.[78] These included screening procedures and training for emergency situations, but not health requirements.[citation needed]\nIn 1984, the U.S. Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act, which, among other things, encourages space commercialization (51 U.S.C. § 20102(c)).\nUnder current US law, any company proposing to launch paying passengers from American soil on a suborbital rocket must receive a license from the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA/AST). The licensing process focuses on public safety and safety of property, and the details can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter III.[79] This is in accordance with the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act passed by Congress in 2004,[80] which required that NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration to allow paying passengers fly on suborbital launch vehicles at their own risk.[81]\nIn March 2010, the New Mexico legislature passed the Spaceflight Informed Consent Act. The SICA gives legal protection to companies who provide private space flights in the case of accidental harm or death to individuals. Participants sign an Informed Consent waiver, dictating that spaceflight operators cannot be held liable in the \"death of a participant resulting from the inherent risks of space flight activities\". Operators are however not covered in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct.[82]\nIn December 2021, the FAA announced that starting in 2022, it would recognize on its official website those who travel to space.[83] \"Any individual who is on an FAA-licensed or permitted launch and reaches 50 statute miles above the surface of the Earth will be listed on the site.\"[83] The announcement ended the Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program, under which the FAA had offered commercial astronaut wings to individuals on private spacecraft who made it above 50 miles (80 kilometers) in altitude above Earth since 2004.[84]\nLegal issues and challenges\n[edit]With the increasing advent of sub-orbital flights, there are growing concerns that the present international framework is insufficient to address the significant issues raised by space tourism. The concerns relate to commercial Liability, insurance, consumer protection, passenger safety, environmental impact, and emergency response.[85][86]\nList of space tourism trips\n[edit]The following list notes each trip taken by an individual for whom a fee was paid (by themselves or another party) to go above the Kármán Line, the internationally recognized boundary of space at 100 km, or above the US definition of the boundary of space at 50 miles (80 km). It also includes future trips which are paid for and scheduled.\n| Flight up (craft) |\nFlight down (craft) |\nDuration | Mission | Tourist(s) | Destination | Fee paid | Tour company | Ref. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| April 28, 2001 (Soyuz TM-32) |\nMay 6, 2001 (Soyuz TM-31) |\n8 days | ISS EP-1 | Dennis Tito | International Space Station | US$20 million | Space Adventures | [43] |\n| April 25, 2002 (Soyuz TM-34) |\nMay 5, 2002 (Soyuz TM-33) |\n10 days | ISS EP-2 | Mark Shuttleworth | US$20 million | |||\n| October 1, 2005 (Soyuz TMA-7) |\nOctober 10, 2005 (Soyuz TMA-6) |\n10 days | ISS EP-3 | Gregory Olsen | US$20 million | |||\n| September 20, 2006 (Soyuz TMA-9) |\nSeptember 29, 2006 (Soyuz TMA-8) |\n10 days | ISS EP-4 | / Anousheh Ansari | US$20 million | |||\n| April 7, 2007 (Soyuz TMA-10) |\nApril 21, 2007 (Soyuz TMA-9) |\n10 days | ISS EP-12 | / Charles Simonyi | US$25 million | |||\n| October 12, 2008 (Soyuz TMA-13) |\nOctober 24, 2008 (Soyuz TMA-12) |\n13 days | ISS EP-13 | / Richard Garriott | US$30 million | [87] | ||\n| March 26, 2009 (Soyuz TMA-14) |\nApril 8, 2009 (Soyuz TMA-13) |\n14 days | ISS EP-14 | / Charles Simonyi | US$35 million | |||\n| September 30, 2009 (Soyuz TMA-16) |\nOctober 11, 2009 (Soyuz TMA-14) |\n12 days | ISS EP-15 | Guy Laliberté | US$35 million | [88] | ||\n| July 20, 2021 (RSS First Step) |\nJuly 20, 2021 (RSS First Step) |\n10 minutes | NS-16 | Sub-orbital spaceflight (Kármán line) |\nBlue Origin | [89][90] | ||\n| September 16, 2021 (Crew Dragon Resilience) |\nSeptember 19, 2021 (Crew Dragon Resilience) |\n3 days | Inspiration4 | Low Earth Orbit | SpaceX | [91] | ||\n| October 13, 2021 (RSS First Step) |\nOctober 13, 2021 (RSS First Step) |\n10 minutes | NS-18 | Sub-orbital spaceflight (Kármán line) |\nBlue Origin | [92] | ||\n| December 8, 2021 (Soyuz MS-20) |\nDecember 20, 2021 (Soyuz MS-20) |\n12 days | ISS EP-20 | International Space Station | Space Adventures | [93][94] | ||\n| December 11, 2021 (RSS First Step) |\nDecember 11, 2021 (RSS First Step) |\n10 minutes | NS-19 |\n|\nSub-orbital spaceflight (Kármán line) |\nBlue Origin | [95] | |\n| March 31, 2022 (RSS First Step) |\nMarch 31, 2022 (RSS First Step) |\n10 minutes | NS-20 |\n|\n[96] | |||\n| April 8, 2022 (Crew Dragon Endeavour) |\nApril 25, 2022 (Crew Dragon Endeavour) |\n17 days | Ax-1 | International Space Station | US$55 million each | Axiom Space | [97][98][91][99][100] | |\n| June 4, 2022 (RSS First Step) |\nJune 4, 2022 (RSS First Step) |\n10 minutes | NS-21 |\n|\nSub-orbital spaceflight (Kármán line) |\nBlue Origin | [101] | |\n| August 4, 2022 (RSS First Step) |\nAugust 4, 2022 (RSS First Step) |\n10 minutes | NS-22 |\n|\n[102] | |||\n| May 21, 2023 (Crew Dragon Freedom) |\nMay 31, 2023 (Crew Dragon Freedom) |\n10 days | Ax-2 | International Space Station | Axiom Space | [103] | ||\n| May 19, 2024 (RSS First Step) |\nMay 19, 2024 (RSS First Step) |\n9 minutes, 53 seconds | NS-25 | Mason Angel Sylvain Chiron Ed Dwight Carol Schaller Kenneth Hess Thotakura Gopichand |\nSub-orbital spaceflight (Kármán line) |\nBlue Origin | ||\n| August 29, 2024 (RSS First Step) |\nAugust 29, 2024 (RSS First Step) |\n10 minutes, 8 seconds | NS-26 | / Nicolina Elrick Karsen Kitchen Rob Ferl Eugene Grin / Eiman Jahangir / Ephraim Rabin |\n||||\n| November 22, 2024 (RSS First Step) |\nNovember 22, 2024 (RSS First Step) |\n10 minutes, 14 seconds | NS-28 | James (J.D.)

Lewis |\nCriticism of the term space tourist\n[edit]Many private space travelers have objected to the term space tourist, often pointing out that their role went beyond that of an observer, since they also carried out scientific experiments in the course of their journey. Richard Garriott additionally emphasized that his training was identical to the requirements of non-Russian Soyuz crew members, and that teachers and other non-professional astronauts chosen to fly with NASA are called astronauts. He has said that if the distinction has to be made, he would rather be called \"private astronaut\" than \"tourist\".[106] Mark Shuttleworth described himself as a \"pioneer of commercial space travel\".[107] Gregory Olsen prefers \"private researcher\",[108] and Anousheh Ansari prefers the term \"private space explorer\". Other advocates of private spaceflight object to the term on similar grounds. Rick Tumlinson of the Space Frontier Foundation, for example, has said: \"I hate the word tourist, and I always will ... 'Tourist' is somebody in a flowered shirt with three cameras around his neck.\"[109] Russian cosmonaut Maksim Surayev told the press in 2009 not to describe Guy Laliberté as a tourist: \"It's become fashionable to speak of space tourists. He is not a tourist but a participant in the mission.\"[110]\n\"Spaceflight participant\" is the official term used by NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency to distinguish between private space travelers and career astronauts. Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights. NASA also lists Christa McAuliffe as a spaceflight participant (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the STS-51-L flight.\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration awards the title of \"commercial astronaut\" to trained crew members of privately funded spacecraft.\nAttitudes towards space tourism\n[edit]A 2018 survey from the PEW Research Center identifies the top three motivations for a customer to purchase a flight into space as:[111]\n- To experience something unique ( e.g. pioneering, one of a kind)\n- To see the view of Earth from space\n- To learn more about the world\nThe PEW study also found that only 43% of Americans would be definitely or probably interested in going into space. NASA astronaut Megan McArthur has a message to space tourists: spaceflight is uncomfortable and risky, and takes grit.[112]\nA web-based survey suggested that over 70% of those surveyed wanted less than or equal to two weeks in space; in addition, 88% wanted to spacewalk, of whom 14% would pay a 50% premium for the experience, and 21% wanted a hotel or space station.[113]\nThe concept has met with some criticism; Günter Verheugen, vice-president of the European Commission, said of the EADS Astrium Space Tourism Project: \"It's only for the super-rich, which is against my social convictions\".[114]\nOn October 14, 2021, Prince William suggested that entrepreneurs should focus on saving Earth rather than engaging in space tourism and also warned about a rise in \"climate anxiety\" among younger generations.[115]\nEnvironmental effects\n[edit]A 2010 study published in Geophysical Research Letters raised concerns that the growing commercial spaceflight industry could accelerate global warming. The study, funded by NASA and The Aerospace Corporation, simulated the impact of 1,000 suborbital launches of hybrid rockets from a single location, calculating that this would release a total of 600 tonnes of black carbon into the stratosphere. They found that the resultant layer of soot particles remained relatively localized, with only 20% of the carbon straying into the southern hemisphere, thus creating a strong hemispherical asymmetry.[117] This unbalance would cause the temperature to decrease by about 0.4 °C (0.72 °F) in the tropics and subtropics, whereas the temperature at the poles would increase by between 0.2 and 1 °C (0.36 and 1.80 °F). The ozone layer would also be affected, with the tropics losing up to 1.7% of ozone cover, and the polar regions gaining 5–6%.[118] The researchers stressed that these results should not be taken as \"a precise forecast of the climate response to a specific launch rate of a specific rocket type\", but as a demonstration of the sensitivity of the atmosphere to the large-scale disruption that commercial space tourism could bring.[117]\nA 2022 study estimated the air pollution impacts on climate change and the ozone layer from rocket launches and re-entry of reusable components and debris in 2019 and from a theoretical future space industry extrapolated from the \"billionaire space race\". It concludes that substantial effects from routine space tourism should \"motivate regulation\".[119][116]\nEducation and advocacy\n[edit]Several organizations have been formed to promote the space tourism industry, including the Space Tourism Society, Space Future, and HobbySpace. UniGalactic Space Travel Magazine is a bi-monthly educational publication covering space tourism and space exploration developments in companies like SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic and organizations like NASA.\nClasses in space tourism are currently taught at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York,[120] and Keio University in Japan.[121] Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida launched a worldwide space tourism course in 2017.[122]\nEconomic potential\n[edit]A 2010 report from the Federal Aviation Administration, titled \"The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U.S. Economy in 2009\", cites studies done by Futron, an aerospace and technology-consulting firm, which predict that space tourism could become a billion-dollar market within 20 years.[123] Eight tourists reached orbit between 2001 and 2009. In 2011 Space Adventures suggested that this number could reach 140 by 2020,[124] but with commercial crewed rockets only just beginning to enter service, such numbers have yet to be achieved.\nAccording to a 2022 report by Research and Markets, titled \"Global Space Tourism Market,\" the global space tourism industry is projected to reach US$8.67 billion by 2030, with an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.1% between 2022 and 2030.[125]\nSee also\n[edit]- Commercialization of space\n- Effect of spaceflight on the human body\n- Private spaceflight\n- Commercial astronaut, a 2004-2021 FAA program designation for early space tourists\n- Spaceflight participant, the official term used by NASA, Roscommon and the FAA for non-astronauts/non-cosmonauts such as space tourists\n- Sub-orbital spaceflight\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Wang was born in China but lives primarily in Svalbard and since 2023 is also a citizen of Malta and Saint Kitts and Nevis through their golden visa programs.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object. The json object must have exactly the following keys:\n    - \"statement\": repeat the input statement text.\n    - \"speaker\": the speaker name.\n    - \"context\": the context text.\n    - \"label\": one of the six labels: \"TRUE\", \"mostly-true\", \"half-true\", \"barely-true\", \"FALSE\", or \"pants-fire\".\n    - \"justification\": a short explanation that cites evidence from the search results.\n\n    Return only this json object and nothing else.\n\n    The field \"Search Results\" below contains text snippets extracted from the top Google Search results related to the statement. These snippets are partial web page texts returned by search. Use them as factual evidence to support your evaluation. If fewer than three snippets are provided, use whatever is available.\n\n    \tStatement: The gender gap in his support is not unique to me and theres not a huge gap from where Republicans have been in presidential, gubernatorial and US Senate elections in recent years.\n        Subject(s): elections,women\n        Speaker: scott-walker\n        Speaker's Job Title: Milwaukee County Executive\n        State Info: Wisconsin\n        Party Affiliation: republican\n        Barely-True: 26\n        False: 41\n        Half-True: 32\n        Mostly-True: 40\n        Pants-Fire: 11\n        Context: an interview\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        1848\nImage\n1866\nImage\n1872\nImage\n1884\nImage\n1887\nImage\n1888\n1892\nImage\n1894\n1895\n1896\nImage\n1900\n1916\nImage\n1920\nImage\nImage\n1922\nImage\nImage\n1923\nImage\nImage\n1924\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1925\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1928\nImage\n1930\n1932\nImage\n1933\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1938\nImage\nImage\n1948\nImage\n1949\nImage\nImage\n1952\nImage\n1955\nImage\n1962\nImage\n1963\nImage\n1964\nImage\n1965\nImage\n1966\nImage\n1967\nImage\n1968\nImage\n1969\n1971\nImage\n1972\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1973\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1974\nImage\nImage\n1975\nImage\n1976\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1977\nImage\n1978\nImage\n1979\nImage\n1980\nImage\nImage\n1981\nImage\n1983\nImage\n1984\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1985\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1986\nImage\n1987\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1988\nImage\n1989\nImage\nImage\n1990\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1992\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1993\nImage\n1994\nImage\n1995\nImage\nImage\n1997\nImage\nImage\n1998\nImage\nImage\n1999\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2001\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2002\nImage\nImage\n2003\nImage\nImage\n2005\nImage\n2007\nImage\nImage\n2008\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2009\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2011\nImage\n2012\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2013\nImage\n2014\nImage\nImage\n2015\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2016\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2017\nImage\nImage\n2018\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2019\n2020\nImage\nImage\n2021\nImage\nImage\n2022\nImage\nImage\n2024\nImage\nImage\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Karen Nikos-Rose, UC Davis\n“A few years ago I took my children on a tour of the state Capitol building. My daughter was very interested in the art — the woodwork, the decorative tiles, and the paintings. After viewing the gallery of governor portraits, she turned to me and asked, ‘Where are all the girls?’”\nBernadette Austin, associate director of the University of California, Davis, Center for Regional Change, studies regional issues and demographics in California, and told this story in a recent newsletter to stakeholders.\n“We know that representation matters,” she wrote. “When we see people like ourselves in positions of leadership, it signals that someone who shares our history and worldview is making decisions that reflect our interests and values.”\nCalifornia, as Austin’s daughter observed, has never had a woman governor, although nationwide, 44 women have served or serve as governors of U.S. states, with a handful having served as governors of U.S. territories. Nine women currently serve as governor of a state.\nPersistent gender gap over most of half century\nAs the 2020 elections draw near, an all-time record of six women ran for president on the Democratic ticket. One candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, dropped out in late fall 2019. Some might call that number — which tripled the previous record — a victory for women’s representation in politics.\nNot so fast.\nWhile women have made great strides in entering the workforce, running companies and getting elected to Congress, there has remained a persistent gender gap in politics over the past 40 years, according to Xiaoling Shu, a UC Davis professor of sociology who studies this phenomenon.\nThe facts about women in political office:\n- U.S. House of Representatives: 102; or 23 percent\n- Senate: 25, or 25 percent\n- Heads of state: About 24 women at any given time\n- Women remain less than a third of all elected officials in the nation in 2019 (Source: Rutgers)\nShu’s latest research shows those attitudes have changed slightly since 2016, when the U.S. electorate nominated the first woman ever to a major political party, Hillary Clinton. She ran against Donald Trump for president and won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, but ultimately lost in the Electoral College, which cost her the election.\nThe 2020 Presidential Election\nAs of February 2019, six women had formally announced their candidacy for president:\n- Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii)\n- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York)\n- Sen. Kamala Harris* (D-California)\n- Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota)\n- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts)\n- Marianne Williamson\nThis is the first time in history that more than two women competed in the same major party’s presidential primary process. (Source: Center for American Women and Politics, Rutgers)\n*Harris dropped out of the race as this story was being written. Read UC Davis research about how Harris' support may transfer to other candidates.\n“Of all (gender) attitudes analyzed,” said Shu and her co-author of a recent paper, Kelsey D. Meagher, also of UC Davis, “Americans hold the most liberal attitudes toward women in politics, with no gender gap and little educational difference on this issue.” Their findings were published in May 2019 by the American Sociological Association. Women and men agree that both sexes are equally suited emotionally for politics, according to the survey the researchers used — General Social Survey of 57,000 people — but the period between 2016-18 saw a larger increase among women than men in supporting for women in politics.\n“Women’s support for women in politics jumped between 2016 and 2018 after two decades of minimal growth,” Shu said.\nPublic polls tell a similar story. In 2018, a Pew Research Center study found that 61 percent of Americans felt positive about more women running for office in 2018. The number of people voicing support for women in politics was higher than in previous Pew surveys. There was little consensus, however, in these surveys, as to whether more women in politics would bring change to policy and politics, and even less agreement on whether women were being elected in larger numbers for a reason, such as the #MeToo movement, President Trump, or because Hillary Clinton was almost elected.\nIn recent decades, women in the United States have cast ballots in elections at higher numbers than men.\nIn the 2016 general election, 63 percent of the citizen voting-age population of women in the U.S. turned out to vote in the 2016 general election compared to 59.3 percent of that population for men, according to Mindy Romero, a UC Davis alumna who is founder and director of the California Civic Engagement Project at University of Southern California. She researches political behavior and race and ethnicity in voting for the university’s Sol Price School of Public Policy in Sacramento.\nA hundred years of voting\nStill, 100 years after women got the right to vote by amendment to the U.S. Constitution, women make up more than half the population, yet account for less than one-third of all elected officials at city, state and national levels combined.\nWomen in Congress\nThe share of candidates who are women varies by office type. Whereas women make up 42 percent of all school board candidates, they are only 27 percent of all city council candidates, according to research co-written by UC Davis assistant professor Rachel Bernhard. She is a political science researcher who focuses on gender, class and race in politics.\nAn even smaller share of mayoral candidates are women, coming in at 21 percent, researchers said.\n“One thing we really see in this study is that women are doing great — but mostly in offices where people assume they are qualified due to their gender, like school board races.” — Rachel Bernhard\n“When the stereotype is that women aren’t qualified — mostly in executive offices like mayors — they do worse than male candidates, even though they have more government experience,” Bernhard added.\nThere are tremendous challenges to achieving parity, echoes a nationwide study, “Unfinished Business: Women Running in 2018 and Beyond,” from Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics.\nFor instance, women of color made historic gains in the 2018 election, but remain far behind Caucasian women and certainly behind Caucasian men, who dominate politics. Moreover, gains for women in the 2018 election were concentrated among Democratic women at every level of office, while the number of Republican women in office fell short of previous highs, according to Rutgers researchers.\n“Achieving gender parity among candidates and officeholders will be unlikely without Republican women,” the Rutgers researchers said.\n“The Republican Party’s reaction to women’s losses in 2018 and recruitment efforts in 2020 will serve as one indicator of whether the party serves as a gateway or gatekeeper to Republican women’s candidacy and officeholding.”\nWomen’s rights and suffrage\nDespite the persisting political gap in officeholders, American women have a long history of fighting for their rights in politics. The United States was a “pioneer in the development of women’s rights, ideas and activism,” wrote Ellen Carol DuBois, UCLA professor of history emerita, in “Women’s Rights, Suffrage, and Citizenship, 1789-1920.” This is the 20th chapter in The Oxford Handbook of American Women’s and Gender History, edited by UC Davis historians Lisa Materson and Ellen Hartigan-O’Connor.\n“Nothing about the history of women’s rights, especially women’s political rights on a national level, reflected the automatic workings of American democracy,” DuBois continued. Instead, she wrote, it was women who were determined to have an equal place in the nation’s political affairs, who pushed long and hard, who were able to achieve anything. It took more than a half century of steady political effort.\nWomen played an active role in the republic being established as 13 colonies broke free of British rule. They persevered, for example, in rejecting imported fabric in favor of the cloth they made at their wheels and looms. They formed “daughters of liberty” clubs to match the “sons.” One of the first histories of the American Revolution was written by a woman, Mercy Otis Warren, of Boston. Some even fought along with soldiers, in addition to nursing, cooking, washing, and raising money for them. But, DuBois documented, they went unrecognized as being part of the polity.\nAbigail Adams in 1776 famously admonished her husband, in her letters, to “remember the ladies,” in the “new code of laws” governing the United States.\nShe pointed out to John Adams and other members of the Continental Congress as they prepared to declare independence from Great Britain that the harsh English laws governing marriage could make husbands “tyrants” over their economically dependent wives. Yet those laws stood.\nA Progressive turn, and California\nBy 1912, Progressives formed a third political party, taking some of those in the Republican party and women supporters with them. But many black women remained loyal to the party of Lincoln. As with most third parties in history, much of its growth split the votes, both literally, with the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912, and figuratively, through party loyalties to women’s suffrage and other issues.\n“In California, by contrast, a 1911 referendum stimulated by the rise of Progressivism narrowly succeeded in enfranchising the state’s one million women,” wrote DuBois. A network of women activists formed clubs, unions and suffrage societies and organized what would now be seen as a typical campaign using pictures, telephones and modern graphic design to promote “votes for women” rather than the old-fashioned “suffrage.” They printed leaflets in Spanish for Latino voters and supported labor reforms.\nBy 1915, 10 states, all west of the Mississippi, had revised their constitutions to enfranchise women. It was clear, wrote DuBois, that the only way to get all women the vote was through an amendment to the federal Constitution.\nBy 1921, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the 19th amendment granting women the right to vote only applied to the states, so Puerto Rican women and Filipinas would organize separately, which didn’t succeed fully until more than a decade later.\nThe continuing gender gap in voting\nOn the whole, women lean significantly more Democratic than men, often by 10 percentage points, said Romero. In California, that gap is even wider. Among women, notably, married women lean slightly more Republican than single women.\nIn surveys, women consistently cite the economy, health care and education as crucial issues that determine how they vote — rating them more highly than men do. As a group, women often find themselves more affected by economic declines. They vote issues that affect their economic vulnerability and are more likely to prefer an active government that produces a stronger social safety net — a key difference in viewpoint separating Republican and Democratic party platforms, Romero said.\n“Race is a key contributor to the huge gender gap in our diverse state,” Romero said.\n“Female voters of color, led by California’s significant Latina population, are driving the gender difference in voting. And both California’s already large proportions of single women and women of color are on the rise.” — Mindy Romero\nWomen and the black vote\nDespite the large gap that remains for women of color in politics, black women also had an important part of grassroots politics even before they had the right to vote, and it is this strong tradition dating back to Reconstruction that helped pave the way to propel Barack Obama into the presidency. These are the findings of UC Davis historian Lisa Materson, author of the 2009 book For the Freedom of Her Race: Black Women and Electoral Politics in Illinois, 1877-1932.\nMaterson, associate professor of history, illustrates in her book that as African American women migrated beyond the reach of southern white supremacists, they became active voters, canvassers, suffragists, campaigners and lobbyists. They mobilized, gaining a voice in national party politics and electing representatives who would push for the enforcement of the Reconstruction Amendments in the South. When black men got the right to vote in 1870, black women, though disfranchised, helped them to remain informed and vote for causes important to their communities.\nObama’s national victories, she wrote in a blog as he entered his second term as president, emerged out of the specific historical context of Chicago politics and black women’s political activism.\n“That the nation’s first African American president holds deep political ties to Chicago is no coincidence because Chicago has long been a key historical site of black political power in the U.S.” — Lisa Materson\nThe gender difference in voter turnout continues today, and is greater for blacks than the general population or whites, noted Romero, of USC. African American women have had much higher turnout than their male counterparts in every election during the past two decades. In 2016, Romero said, African American women voter turnout was 9 percent higher than for African American men. This marked the largest difference in black voter turnout since 1996.\nHistorically, achieving the vote came in stages\n“Women in Illinois acquired voting rights in three stages: suffrage for school officials in 1891, expanded suffrage for many municipal and federal offices in 1913, and the full franchise in 1920,” wrote Materson in the introduction to her book. It was similar in other states, with women getting pieces of voting rights a little at a time before the enactment of the 19th Amendment.\nBetween 1915 and 1928, black voters in Chicago helped to put more black men into office than any other American city, including a black Congressman, Oscar DePriest, said Materson. His 1928 victory made him the first black American to serve in Congress since 1901. Black men continued to win in Chicago, and Obama was no exception. He lost one election, but won a seat in the U.S. Senate that made him the nation’s fifth black senator, giving him national recognition and eventually, the presidency.\nWomen candidates and the ‘double bind’\nScholars are looking at how women candidates are viewed differently than men, particularly in media coverage. Erin C. Cassese, associate professor of political science at University of Delaware, is among many researchers looking at the “double bind” — or the need for candidates to embody a particular mix of both masculine and feminine traits in order to appear palatable to American voters. “The double bind was a challenge for Hillary Clinton’s candidacies in 2008 and 2016, and we will evaluate how it manifests in 2020,” she said in an analysis published by Rutgers.\nAt this writing, Elizabeth Warren was a frontrunner among Democratic challengers to President Trump. Christine Jahnke, a nationally recognized speech coach and author based in Washington, D.C., and founder of Positive Communications, said Warren has a style that differs from her male counterparts in the election.\n“Warren is continuously redefining what leadership looks and sounds like. It’s exciting how she energized huge crowds with policy solutions, not bombastic rhetoric,” Jahnke wrote in the Rutgers analysis.\n“Warren calls out corruption while speaking empathetically for those who’ve lost the most. And voters are listening.”\nAmber Boydstun, associate professor of political science at UC Davis and a specialist on elections and media said it remains to be seen if Warren will continue to energize the electorate. \"We'll need to wait and see whether voters’ enthusiasm for Warren is enough to break through the double-bind barrier.\"\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        “A few years ago I took my children on a tour of the state Capitol building. My daughter was very interested in the art — the woodwork, the decorative tiles and the paintings. After viewing the gallery of governor portraits, she turned to me and asked, ‘Where are all the girls?’”\nBernadette Austin, associate director of the University of California, Davis, Center for Regional Change, studies regional issues and demographics in California, and told this story in a recent newsletter to stakeholders.\n“We know that representation matters,” she wrote. “When we see people like ourselves in positions of leadership, it signals that someone who shares our history and worldview is making decisions that reflect our interests and values.”\nCalifornia, as Austin’s daughter observed, has never had a woman governor, although nationwide, 44 women have served or serve as governors of U.S. states, with a handful having served as governors of U.S. territories. Nine women currently serve as governor of a state.\nPersistent gender gap over most of half century\nAs the 2020 elections draw near, an all-time record of six women ran for president on the Democratic ticket. One candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, dropped out in late fall 2019. Some might call that number — which tripled the previous record — a victory for women’s representation in politics.\nNot so fast.\nWhile women have made great strides in entering the workforce, running companies and getting elected to Congress, there has remained a persistent gender gap in politics over the past 40 years, according to Xiaoling Shu, a UC Davis professor of sociology who studies this phenomenon.\nThe facts about women in political office:\n- U.S. House of Representatives: 102; or 23%\n- Senate: 25, or 25%\n- Heads of state: About 24 women at any given time\n- Women remain less than a third of all elected officials in the nation in 2019 (Source: Rutgers)\nShu’s latest research shows those attitudes have changed slightly since 2016, when the U.S. electorate nominated the first woman ever to a major political party, Hillary Clinton.

As a result, over 2 million Americans have regained the right to vote.\nRelated to: Voting Rights\nOverview\nVoting eligibility and a person’s involvement in the criminal legal system have a historical but unnatural association in the United States. Some state laws dating back over 100 years, and motivated by racist ideology, permanently ban people convicted of a felony from voting, and almost all states have long prevented voting by people in prison. Over the last 50 years the country’s investment in mass incarceration not only staggeringly increased the prison population and the community of people with a criminal record but increased the number of people banned from voting due to a felony conviction.1 As a result, over 4.6 million Americans with a felony conviction were disenfranchised as of 2022,2 disproportionately impacting Black and Latinx residents.\nDespite the stark consequences of mass incarceration and voter disenfranchisement,3 the advocacy of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated activists, organizers, legislative champions, and others have successfully fought to pass reforms to expand voting rights to justice-impacted individuals. These changes, both administrative and statutory in recent decades, coupled by recent modest declines in the population of incarcerated people and those under community supervision reduced the total number of people disenfranchised by 24% since reaching its peak in 2016.4\nUnderstanding the origins of this progress to restore voting rights is beneficial for democracy and justice. This report provides a state-by-state accounting of the changes to voting rights for people with felony convictions and measures its impact.5 Since 1997, 26 states and the District of Columbia have expanded voting rights to people living with felony convictions or amended policies to guarantee ballot access. These reforms were achieved through various mechanisms, including legislative reform, executive action, and ballot measures.\nThe reforms include:\n- restoration of voting rights to persons in prison in Washington, DC;\n- expansion of voting rights to some or all persons on felony probation or parole in 12 states; and\n- increased accessibility for persons seeking rights restoration in 14 states.\nOver 2 million Americans have regained the right to vote since 1997. These changes to expand and guarantee voting rights demonstrate national momentum to reform the nation’s restrictive and racially discriminatory voting laws.\n| State | Change | # People Impacted |\n|---|---|---|\n| Alabama |\nStreamlined restoration process (2003);

Specifically, it required the state to issue an explanation of denial within 45 days of application or an eligibility certificate within 50 days of the application. The number of individuals achieving voting rights restoration increased by 79% following the first year of the reform’s enactment. Between 2004 and 2021, 23,376 people had their voting rights restored through the timely issuance of eligibility certificates.6\nAlabama’s Constitution bans voting rights for residents convicted of felonies classified as involving “moral turpitude.” Before 2017, the state never specified which offenses disqualified a resident from voting due to this classification. The lack of a statutory definition resulted in a disparate practice from county to county, giving local election officials the discretion to determine which convictions banned residents from voting. In 2017, Governor Kay Ivey signed the Definition of Moral Turpitude Act, which specified for the first time a list of 47 disqualifying offenses that resulted in a denial of voting rights. At the time of passage, Alabama officials estimated 60,000 residents would have their voting rights reinstated automatically because they had been denied based on offenses not on the list.7\nCalifornia: Voting Rights Restored to 145,000, 2011-2020\nIn California, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| California Disenfranchised Population | 97,328 | 0.4% |\n| Black | 28,578 | 1.7% |\n| Latinx | 43,435 | 0.6% |\nCalifornia’s 2011 Realignment policy diverted many individuals convicted of non-violent felonies from incarceration in state prisons to local jails or community supervision where individuals would report to probation officers. At the time, California law allowed people on felony probation, but not parole or prison, to vote. In 2011, Secretary of State Debra Bowen instructed county election officials to extend the voting ban to people with felony convictions who were moved to jails or community supervision under Realignment. Civil rights groups sued the state on behalf of citizens on community supervision, arguing that because these individuals now report to county probation officers instead of state parole officers, they are therefore on probation and should be allowed to vote. In 2014, a superior court ruled Bowen’s application of the Realignment Act was unconstitutional, asserting the intention of the law was to “introduce [formerly incarcerated persons] into the community, which is consistent with restoring their right to vote.” The state appealed the ruling. In 2015, Alex Padilla, Bowen’s successor, reversed her policy and dropped the case. Padilla’s action expanded voting rights to 45,000 people on post-release community supervision.8\nAssembly Bill 2466, signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016, further expanded voting rights under the Realignment Act. The measure authorized voting rights for an estimated 50,000 people serving felony sentences in county jails.9\nIn 2020, 59% of California voters approved Proposition 17, amending the state Constitution to restore voting rights to individuals on parole.10 The measure restored the vote to approximately 50,000 people.11\nColorado: Restoration of Voting Rights to 11,500 People, 2019\nIn Colorado, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Colorado Disenfranchised Population | 17,455 | 0.4% |\n| Black | 3,272 | 2.0% |\n| Latinx | 5,268 | 0.8% |\nPrior to 2019, people on parole were required to complete their sentence before regaining the right to vote. In an effort to combat misinformation around voting with a felony conviction, Colorado lawmakers passed legislation in 2018 authorizing people on parole to pre-register to vote prior to completing their sentence. The legislation required parole officers to inform individuals on parole of their voting rights and required the state’s department of corrections to provide the secretary of state with a monthly report of individuals released from parole so their voting status could be updated.12 A year later, House Bill 1266 expanded voting rights to nearly 11,500 residents on parole.13\nConnecticut: Voting Rights Restored to 37,000 People, 2001-2021\nIn Connecticut, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Connecticut Disenfranchised Population | 6,892 | 0.3% |\n| Black | 3,029 | 1.2% |\n| Latinx | 1,919 | 0.6% |\nConnecticut lawmakers expanded voting rights to more than 33,000 people on felony probation in 2001.14 However, people seeking the right to vote were required to provide “written or satisfactory proof” of voter eligibility. In 2006, state policymakers repealed that requirement, removing potential complications that may arise in securing such proof and increasing the likelihood that eligible residents would take advantage of their right to vote.15\nIn 2021, Connecticut lawmakers expanded voting rights to people on parole living in their community.16 This change reinstated voting rights to an estimated 4,000 Connecticut residents.17\nRestoring the right to vote is smart policy. It enables people who are incarcerated to feel connected to their communities, especially as they re-enter society, and therefore reduces the likelihood of them taking part in criminal activity and returning to prison. After all, if I’m an active voter then I’m an active voice in my community. But all that is held up if I’m not given the right to vote.\nDelaware: Voting Rights Restored to 6,989 People, 2000-2013\nDelaware disenfranchises individuals with felony convictions in prison, on felony probation or parole, and after completion of sentence for certain felony offenses.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Delaware Disenfranchised Population | 7,721 | 1.1% |\n| Black | 4,016 | 2.6% |\n| Latinx | 423 | 1.1% |\nIn 2000, Delaware lawmakers amended the state’s constitution to repeal lifetime disenfranchisement and allow most residents convicted of a felony offense to apply to the Board of Elections for their voting rights five years after the completion of their sentence. The reform continued to ban voting rights for people with certain convictions (murder or crimes of a sexual nature) unless they were pardoned. Voting rights were restored to an estimated 6,400 individuals, or about one-third of the state’s disenfranchised population at the time.18\nIn 2013, state policymakers adopted the Hazel D. Plant Voter Restoration Act,19 which removed the five-year waiting period and automatically restored voting rights to eligible persons who completed their sentence. Those convicted of a disqualifying felony offense are still permanently disenfranchised. Delaware reported 589 pardons and commutations for 2020 through midyear 2022.20\nDistrict of Columbia: Voting Rights Restored to 2,400 People, 2020\nResidents with felony convictions in the District of Columbia never lose their right to vote.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| DC Disenfranchised Population | 0 | 0% |\n| Black | 0 | 0% |\n| Latinx | 0 | 0% |\nIn 2020, Washington, DC officials authorized universal suffrage through the passage of the Restore the Vote Amendment.21 The change restored voting rights for incarcerated citizens with a felony conviction. The District joined Maine, Vermont, and Puerto Rico in the elimination of felony disenfranchisement.\nAt the time of passage, the DC Board of Elections reported sending 2,400 voter registration forms to incarcerated residents in jail and prison.22\nFlorida: Voting Rights Restored to 238,722, 2004-2021\nFlorida authorizes voting for most citizens who have completed their sentence and paid their fines and fees. Persons convicted of murder and crimes of a sexual nature are disqualified from voting for life unless they receive clemency from the governor.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Florida Disenfranchised Population | 1,150,944 | 7.5% |\n| Black | 291,811 | 12.8% |\n| Latinx | 106,709 | 3.4% |\nFlorida officials and voters have addressed one of the nation’s most restrictive disenfranchisement laws through a series of policy changes. In 2004, then-Governor Jeb Bush amended the Rules of Executive Clemency to expedite the voter restoration process, alleviating a backlog of tens of thousands of rights restoration applications.23 Before Gov. Bush’s rule change, individuals were required to attend an in-person clemency hearing. The change limited the requirement for an in-person hearing as long as they were not convicted of a violent crime and had remained arrest-free for five years. Individuals convicted of all other offense types were required to complete a 15-year arrest-free period before applying to have their rights restored. Gov. Bush restored voting rights to 75,000 people during his two terms in office.24\nIn 2006, Florida lawmakers passed a bill requiring correctional facilities to provide people in prison with rights restoration application information at least two weeks prior to their release date. This change was in response to the difficulties presented by Florida’s complex and confusing restoration process.25\nIn 2007, Governor Charlie Crist and the Board of Executive Clemency approved a new rule change, automatically restoring voting rights for individuals convicted of certain, mostly nonviolent offenses. Residents convicted of more serious offenses, excluding some violent crimes and crimes of a sexual nature, became eligible to have their voting rights restored without a clemency hearing. Individuals convicted of murder or crimes of a sexual nature are still required to wait 15 years after sentence completion (during which time they must remain arrest-free) to apply without a hearing or to petition the Board directly for a review and in-person hearing. During Crist’s administration, voting rights were restored to more than 150,000 people.26\nDuring Governor Rick Scott’s administration, the 2007 clemency rules were amended to require the clemency board to review all rights restoration applications. The 2011 change also added additional paperwork for each case, regardless of offense type. As a result, rights restoration applications declined by nearly 95%.27\nIn 2018, Florida voters expanded voting rights to as many as 1.4 million Floridians with a felony conviction by approving Amendment 4. The change provided for the automatic reinstatement of voting rights for justice-involved residents with eligible felony conviction histories once they completed their prison, felony probation, or parole sentence. Persons convicted of homicide and crimes of a sexual nature were excluded from the measure. In 2019, Florida lawmakers passed and Governor Ron DeSantis signed Senate Bill 7066, restricting the voting rights of people who had not paid court-ordered monetary sanctions, and effectively re-disenfranchising the majority of those whose rights Amendment 4 had restored.28\nFrom 2016 through 2020, 3,250 Floridians had their voting rights restored post-sentence by state officials.29 In fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the Florida Commission on Offender Review reported that 4,244 and 6,278 rights restoration applications were respectively approved.30 As of 2022, an estimated 934,500 Floridians who completed their sentences remained disenfranchised.31\nGeorgia: Voting Rights Restored to 40,679 People, Years 2020-2023\nIn Georgia, people can vote following the completion of their prison, felony probation, or parole sentence.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Georgia Disenfranchised Population | 234,410 | 3.1% |\n| Black | 124,858 | 5.2% |\n| Latinx | 7,467 | 2.0% |\nThe Georgia Secretary of State’s office clarified in 2020 that anyone who has completed their sentence, even if they carry outstanding monetary debt, can vote.32 According to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, fines that were a condition of probation are automatically cancelled upon completion of probation.33 Reported estimates suggest that 40,679 justice-impacted residents in Georgia became eligible to register to vote following the Secretary of State’s guidance.34\nHawaii: No Estimate Available\nHawaii restores voting rights to individuals upon release from prison.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Hawaii Disenfranchised Population | 3,007 | 0.3% |\n| Black | 134 | 0.6% |\n| Latinx | 71 | 0.1% |\nState officials passed legislation in 2006 to guarantee ballot access for justice-impacted voters by improving information sharing. Before the policy change, many people released from prison were incorrectly coded or were not included in the eligible voter database. To address this, Hawaii lawmakers required the clerk of the court to transmit an individual’s name, date of birth, address, and social security number to the person’s county within 20 days of release.35\nIowa: Voting Rights Restored to 120,776 People, 2005-2020\nIowa disenfranchises all individuals with felony convictions for life unless they receive clemency from the governor.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Iowa Disenfranchised Population | 30,130 | 1.3% |\n| Black | 6,310 | 9.5% |\n| Latinx | 2,507 | 3.0% |\nBefore 2005, Iowa imposed a lifetime voting ban on anyone convicted of an “infamous crime.” The only mechanism in place to restore voting rights was a gubernatorial pardon. In 2005, Governor Tom Vilsack issued Executive Order 42, which immediately restored voting rights to all persons in Iowa who completed their sentence and made the restoration process automatic for new persons completing their sentence.36 The order restored voting rights to an estimated 100,000 people.37\nShortly after taking office in 2011, Governor Terry Branstad reversed Gov. Vilsack’s order, reverting the restoration process back to a case-by-case basis. During 2016, Gov. Branstad simplified the rights restoration application, reducing the number of questions in half and removing several burdensome requirements.38\nIn 2020, Governor Kim Reynolds issued an executive order restoring voting rights to 20,000 Iowans who completed their felony sentences.39 The measure did not include people convicted of homicide. As well, the state can impose special sentences ranging in length from 10 years to life imprisonment for certain crimes of a sexual nature.40 According to Iowa’s Secretary of State’s office, 4,127 Iowans whose registration had been canceled prior to the 2020 executive order re-registered following Gov. Reynold’s action. Of those registered voters, 3,179 participated in the November 2020 general election.41 The order took effect in January 2020, and Iowa officials reported an additional 776 restorations of voting rights by August 2020.42\nKentucky: Voting Rights Restored to 189,949 People, 2004-2023\nKentucky disenfranchises all individuals with felony convictions for life unless they secure clemency from the governor.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Kentucky Disenfranchised Population | 152,727 | 4.5% |\n| Black | 29,533 | 11.5% |\n| Latinx | 2,516 | 4.1% |\nKentucky, like Florida, Iowa, Tennessee and Virginia, maintains one of the most restrictive voting bans for people with felony convictions in the country. In 2001, Kentucky lawmakers passed legislation to simplify the process of applying to the governor for voting rights restoration. The law required the Department of Corrections to inform individuals of their right to apply to the governor to have their voting rights restored. In addition, the law required the department to collect information regarding all eligible citizens who have inquired about having their voting rights restored and to submit that list to the governor’s office.\nIn 2004, Governor Ernie Fletcher issued an executive order that reversed some of the previous progress made to ease the rights restoration process. In addition to supplying three personal reference letters, the policy change required all applicants to submit a formal letter explaining why they believed their voting rights should be restored. Subsequently, the number of individuals receiving their voting rights declined under the Fletcher administration.43 Governor Steve Beshear repealed the policy in March 2008 with the elimination of the filing fee requirement, personal statement, and reference letters. Between 2008 and 2015, approximately 10,500 people had their voting rights restored.44 He also issued an executive order automatically restoring voting rights to over 100,000 people with nonviolent felony convictions who completed their sentences in November 2015, but Governor Matt Bevin reversed the executive order a month later.45 According to his administration, Gov. Bevin issued almost 1,000 restorations of civil rights.46\nAs of 2023, an executive order issued by Governor Andy Beshear in 2019 resulted in more than 178,390 persons who completed sentences for nonviolent offenses regaining their voting rights.47 Kentucky officials also reported 59 restorations among those who were not otherwise eligible for restoration under the executive order.48\nLouisiana: Voting Rights Restored to 43,000 People, 2018\nLouisiana restricts voting rights for people in prison and individuals with felony convictions who have been incarcerated within the last five years.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Louisiana Disenfranchised Population | 52,073 | 1.5% |\n| Black | 32,865 | 3.0% |\n| Latinx | 213 | 0.2% |\nIn 2008, the state legislature passed a bill requiring the Department of Public Safety and Corrections to inform individuals who have completed their sentence of their right to vote.49\nIn 2018, House Bill 265 was enacted following Governor John Bel Edwards’s signing, restoring voting rights to anyone with a felony conviction who has not been incarcerated within the last five years, including those completing their sentencing on felony probation or parole.50 The measure excluded residents with election fraud or other election-related offense convictions. Estimates indicated the legislation would expand voting rights to 40,000 people completing their sentence on felony probation and 3,000 completing their sentence on parole.51\nMaryland: Voting Rights Restored to 92,000 People, 2002-2016\nIn Maryland, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Maryland Disenfranchised Population | 16,587 | 0.4% |\n| Black | 11,678 | 0.9% |\n| Latinx | 771 | 0.3% |\nMaryland experienced several changes in felony disenfranchisement over the last two decades. Before 2002, persons convicted of a first-time felony offense regained their voting rights after completion of their sentence, but anyone with two or more convictions was banned from voting for life. In 2002, Maryland lawmakers reformed the restoration process for persons convicted of two or more nonviolent offenses. That change authorized automatic voter eligibility for individuals with a second nonviolent conviction three years after completing their sentence. Marylanders with violent convictions seeking their voting rights were still required to apply for a gubernatorial pardon.52\nIn 2007, the varying rules for post-incarceration rights restoration were replaced with automatic restoration for all persons after sentence completion, resulting in an expansion of voting rights for more than 52,000 residents.53\nMaryland lawmakers expanded voting rights to people completing their sentence on felony probation and parole in 2016 through House Bill 980, overriding Governor Lary Hogan’s veto.54 The reform expanded voting rights to an estimated 40,000 people.55\nMinnesota: Voting Rights Restored to 46,351 People, 2023\nIn Minnesota, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Minnesota Disenfranchised Population | 55,192 | 1.3% |\n| Black | 11,532 | 5.9% |\n| Latinx | 3,281 | 2.6% |\n* This table does not include 2023 reform\nState lawmakers enacted legislation expanding voting rights to citizens completing their felony probation or parole sentence in 2023. About 84%, or 46,351, disenfranchised Minnesotans were completing their sentence outside of prison and thus affected by the reform.56\nNebraska: Rights Restored to 50,276 People, 2005-2022\nNebraska requires residents to wait two years after completing their prison, felony probation, or parole sentence to have their voting rights automatically restored.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Nebraska Disenfranchised Population | 17,960 | 1.3% |\n| Black | 3,377 | 5.9% |\n| Latinx | 4,701 | 5.5% |\nIn 2004, the Vote Nebraska Initiative issued a report with 16 recommendations designed to avoid electoral controversies like those that arose during the 2000 election in Florida. At the time, Nebraska imposed a lifetime voting ban for citizens with a felony conviction. While the report recommended automatic restoration of voting rights to people after completion of sentence, the 2005 policy change that followed imposed the two-year waiting period after sentence completion. Nonetheless, the 2005 change restored voting rights to an estimated 50,000 Nebraskans.57 Officials reported 44 Nebraskans had their voting rights restored from 2016 to 202058 and reported 232 individuals had their rights restored from 2020 through 2022.59\nI was released from prison in 2018. Nevertheless, I will not be allowed to vote until I have been off supervision for two years. That means I will not have my voting rights restored until the year 2030...It gives me hope to see so many people across the country fighting to expand and protect the right to vote for people who have been impacted by the criminal legal system.\nNevada: Rights Restored to 77,000 People, 2016-2019\nIn Nevada, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Nevada Disenfranchised Population | 12,188 | 0.6% |\n| Black | 3,785 | 1.9% |\n| Latinx | 2,599 | 0.6% |\nPrior to 2001, Nevada imposed a lifetime voting ban for all persons convicted of a felony offense unless their voting rights were restored by the Board of Pardons Commissioners or the sentencing court for those on felony probation. Individuals released from felony probation were required to wait six months to petition the board, and others had to wait five years after completing their sentence before applying for rights restoration. In 2001, the state eliminated this two-tiered waiting period and simplified the application process.60\nDuring the 2003 legislative session, Nevada lawmakers adopted a measure automatically restoring the right to vote to any person convicted of a first-time nonviolent offense after completing their sentence.61\nIn 2017, Nevada policymakers adopted Assembly Bill 181, which restored voting rights to people who receive a “dishonorable discharge” from felony probation or parole. Previously residents who were dishonorably discharged from community supervision were banned from voting. The law also allowed people convicted of certain “category B” crimes (offenses that carry a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 20 years in prison) to have their rights restored after a two-year waiting period.62 The number of people impacted is not known.\nIn 2019, Nevada lawmakers enacted legislation that automatically restored voting rights to people convicted of felonies but released from prison.63 Under the previous process, individuals released from prison had to petition the court to regain the right to vote through a cumbersome process. One analysis estimated 281 Nevadans had their rights restored over a 20-year period.64 The 2019 legislative change has led to the restoration of rights to 77,000 Nevadans.65\nNew Jersey: Rights Restored to 80,000 People, 2019\nIn New Jersey, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| New Jersey Disenfranchised Population | 13,999 | 0.2% |\n| Black | 8,281 | 1.0% |\n| Latinx | 2,341 | 0.3% |\nThe New Jersey Assembly enacted a comprehensive package of criminal legal reforms in 2010 that included a requirement that state criminal justice agencies provide individuals exiting prison with general information regarding state law and their eligibility to vote.66 People on felony probation and parole had their voting rights restored in 2019 by a law signed by Governor Phil Murphy. The change affected more than 80,000 people.67\nNew Mexico: Rights Restored to 80,000 People, 2001-2023\nIn New Mexico, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| New Mexico Disenfranchised Population | 17,572 | 1.2% |\n| Black | 1,004 | 3.2% |\n| Latinx | 9,949 | 1.5% |\n* This table does not include 2023 reform\nState lawmakers repealed the lifetime felony disenfranchisement ban in 2001 by restoring the right to vote to all citizens convicted of a felony upon completion of their sentence. The reform expanded voting rights to nearly 69,000 residents. To streamline the rights restoration process in 2005, policymakers implemented a notification process requiring the Department of Corrections to issue a certificate of completion of sentence to individuals who satisfactorily met obligations and to notify the Secretary of State when such persons become eligible to vote.68\nThe New Mexico Legislature adopted voting rights legislation that included a provision restoring voting rights to more than 11,000 residents on felony probation and parole in 2023.69\nNew York: Rights Restored to 35,000 People, 2018\nIn New York, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| New York Disenfranchised Population | 36,553 | 0.3% |\n| Black | 18,115 | 0.9% |\n| Latinx | 8,748 | 0.4% |\nIn 2010, the legislature required criminal justice agencies to notify people exiting felony probation or parole supervision of their right to vote. A formal notification was necessary because, according to reports, New York election officials regularly misapplied the law and some reportedly insisted persons provide unnecessary paperwork to prove their eligibility to vote.70\nIn 2021, the New York Legislature passed legislation that automatically restored voting rights to people on parole. The measure codified the voting rights expansion established via executive order in 2018 by Governor Andrew Cuomo. The executive order granted voting rights to 35,000 people under parole supervision by issuing conditional pardons to people on parole.71 The underlying law did not change, necessitating the legislature to enact subsequent statutory change.\nNorth Carolina: No Estimate on Voting Rights Restoration Is Available\nNorth Carolina prohibits all citizens convicted of a felony conviction in prison, on probation, or parole from voting.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| North Carolina Disenfranchised Population | 29,461 | 0.4% |\n| Black | 15,148 | 0.9% |\n| Latinx | 1,728 | 0.5% |\nVoting rights are automatically restored upon completion of sentence and individuals can register to vote after filing a certificate demonstrating unconditional discharge with the county of conviction or residence. As in many other states, there has been concern that confusion about eligibility requirements and restoration procedures may prevent people from registering to vote in North Carolina. In 2007, the legislature passed a bill requiring the State Board of Elections, the Department of Corrections, and the Administrative Office of the Courts to establish and implement a program where individuals are informed of their eligibility to vote and given instructions on what steps to take to register.72\nIn 2019, a lawsuit was filed challenging the constitutionality of North Carolina’s felony disenfranchisement law, arguing that the law, which disproportionately impacts Black residents, restricts people from voting “based on impermissible race and class-based classifications.”73 Following a series of court rulings, people who were not serving felony sentences in jail or prison were authorized to vote through 2023. The legal battle concluded in April 2023 when the North Carolina State Supreme Court ruled to uphold the state’s disenfranchisement law.74\nRhode Island: Restoration of Rights to 17,000 People, 2006\nIn Rhode Island, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Rhode Island Disenfranchised Population | 1,606 | 0.2% |\n| Black | 477 | 1.1% |\n| Latinx | 447 | 0.5% |\nPrior to 2006, Rhode Island was the only state in New England with felony disenfranchisement laws extending to persons on both felony probation and parole. Rhode Island voters approved a ballot referendum to amend the state constitution to expand voting rights to people on felony probation and parole in November 2006. The law restored the right to vote to more than 17,000 residents.75\nTennessee: Restoration of Rights to 5,449 People, 2016-2022\nTennessee bans people from voting who are in prison or on felony probation or parole, as well as individuals post-sentence who were convicted of a felony offense after 1981 and those convicted of select offenses prior to 1973. Individuals convicted of a felony in 1973-1981 never lost their voting rights.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Tennessee Disenfranchised Population | 471,592 | 9.3% |\n| Black | 174,203 | 21.0% |\n| Latinx | 10,531 | 8.2% |\nPrior to 2006, eligibility and the restoration of voting rights varied based on offense type and conviction date. At that time Tennessee lawmakers enacted legislation simplifying the policy. Persons convicted of certain offenses after 1981 gained the right to apply for voting rights restoration with the Board of Probation and Parole following sentence completion. The 2006 law requires all outstanding legal financial obligations, including child support, to be paid before a person’s voting rights are restored.76 Officials reported 5,449 Tenneseans had their rights restored from 2016 through 2022.77\nNow that I am out of jail, I continue to confront social, political, and economic discrimination because I have been convicted of a felony. After 50 years of mass incarceration and harsh sentencing policies, it’s time to remove this discrimination from our society and chart a better path forward.\nTexas: Rights Restored to 317,000, 1997\nIn Texas, citizens can vote after sentence completion of their prison, felony probation, or parole term.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Texas Disenfranchised Population | 455,160 | 2.5% |\n| Black | 126,388 | 5.2% |\n| Latinx | 159,011 | 2.8% |\nTexas has incrementally expanded voting rights to people with felony convictions since 1983. In that year the state repealed its lifetime voting ban for persons with felony convictions, replacing it with a five-year post-sentence waiting period.78, 79-94.)) In 1985 the waiting period was reduced to two years. In 1997, under Republican Governor George W. Bush, state lawmakers eliminated the waiting period and authorized automatic voting rights restoration after an individual’s sentence. The legislation expanded voting rights to an estimated 317,000 people.79\nUtah: No Estimate Available\nIn Utah, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Utah Disenfranchised Population | 6,238 | 0.3% |\n| Black | 450 | 2.2% |\n| Latinx | 1,183 | 0.6% |\nUtah allowed voting for citizens sentenced to prison with a felony conviction until 1998. A public referendum then amended Utah’s constitution to impose a voting ban for persons sentenced to a felony prison term. Those convicted in Utah had voting rights automatically restored after release from prison, but Utah residents convicted out of state were subjected to a lifetime voting ban. In 2006, this changed: the Utah General Assembly allowed automatic voting eligibility to all Utah residents after incarceration.80\nVirginia: Voting Rights Restoration to 317,300 People, 2002-2023\nVirginia disenfranchises all individuals with felony convictions for life unless the governor approves individual rights restoration.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Virginia Disenfranchised Population | 312,540 | 5.0% |\n| Black | 147,164 | 12.2% |\n| Latinx | 6,550 | 1.9% |\nState lawmakers enacted several policy developments since 2000 to expand voting rights to Virginia residents and improve ballot access. In 2000, Virginia enacted legislation requiring the department of corrections to notify individuals under its jurisdiction about the state’s voting ban and the application process for rights restoration for those eligible.\nUpon taking office in 2002, Governor Mark Warner streamlined the process of applying to the governor for voting rights restoration. He reduced the required paperwork from 13 pages to 1 for most people convicted of a nonviolent offense and decreased the waiting period to apply to three years following sentence completion. He also eliminated the requirement to submit three reference letters. During his administration, Gov. Warner restored voting rights to 3,500 Virginians, exceeding the combined total of all governors between 1982 and 2002. His successor, Governor Tim Kaine, continued this commitment to rights restoration, restoring voting rights to more than 4,300 persons while in office.81\nIn 2010, Governor Bob McDonnell streamlined the voter restoration process for individuals with felony convictions by decreasing the waiting period from three to two years. He also established a 60-day deadline for processing civil rights restoration applications after receiving corroborating information from courts and other agencies. These reforms reversed McDonnell’s initial restoration policy which required applicants to write a letter explaining why they wanted their voting rights restored.82 In 2013, Gov. McDonnell issued an executive order establishing an automatic rights restoration process for residents with nonviolent convictions who completed their sentence and paid all fines and restitution.83 The change both removed the waiting period and eliminated the application process. During his four years in office, Gov. McDonnell restored voting rights to nearly 7,000 Virginians.84\nIn 2016, Governor Terry McAuliffe leveraged his clemency authority to restore voting rights to approximately 200,000 Virginians who had completed their sentence. Opponents challenged the action in the state Supreme Court, which ruled rights restoration needed to be applied on an individual basis. Gov. McAuliffe subsequently restored voting rights to over 173,000 people.85\nIn 2021, Governor Ralph Northam issued an executive order to automatically restore voting rights to individuals upon completion of their sentence of incarceration.86 The change immediately affected more than 69,000 Virginians, and ultimately Gov. Northam restored voting rights to an estimated 126,000 Virginia residents during this term.87\nGovernor Glenn Youngking initially continued former Gov. Northam’s practice of automatically restoring the right to vote to all Virginians who are not currently incarcerated. However, he ended that practice sometime after May 2022. Nonetheless, an estimated 3,500 Virginians have had their rights restored during Gov. Youngkin’s administration.88\nWashington: Voting Rights Restored to 20,000 People, 2021\nIn Washington, a person convicted of a felony loses their right to vote during imprisonment.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Washington Disenfranchised Population | 17,001 | 0.3% |\n| Black | 2,976 | 1.6% |\n| Latinx | 2,547 | 0.6% |\nIn 2009, Governor Christine Gregoire signed legislation that eliminated the requirement to pay all fines, fees, and restoration before regaining the right to vote. Previously, persons who completed their term of probation or parole but had not paid their legal debt were banned from voting. Further exacerbating the problem, legal system debts accrued 12% interest per year. Many individuals with felony convictions found it challenging to fully pay off their legal debts and subsequently were never able to receive rights restoration. Under the law change, individuals were still obligated to pay their criminal legal system debt, but not denied their voting rights.\nUntil 2021, people on felony probation or parole could not vote. Washington state lawmakers enacted legislation automatically restoring these rights to more than 20,000 on felony probation or parole.89\nWyoming: Voting Rights Restored to 4,282 People, 2003-2023\nWyoming restores voting rights only to those convicted of nonviolent felony offenses who have completed their sentence.\n| Total | % Voting Age Population Disenfranchised | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Wyoming Disenfranchised Population | 10,306 | 2.4% |\n| Black | 287 | 7.6% |\n| Latinx | 1,040 | 3.3% |\nIn 2003, Wyoming authorized persons convicted of first-time, nonviolent felony offenses to apply to the Wyoming Board of Parole for a certificate to restore their voting rights following sentence completion after a five-year waiting period.90 Between 2003 and 2014, 82 people applied and had their voting rights restored.91\nIn 2015, Wyoming authorized automatic rights restoration for citizens convicted of first-time, nonviolent felony convictions who completed their sentence and subsequently eliminated the application process and the five-year waiting period for residents with qualifying conviction histories. Individuals convicted prior to 2016 and those with out-of-state and federal convictions were still required to apply for their voting rights following completion of sentence. An estimated 4,200 persons were eligible to apply for rights restoration at the time of the bill’s passage.92\nLawmakers passed House Bill 75 in 2017 to expand voting rights to individuals convicted of any nonviolent offense.93 Under this law, the Wyoming Department of Corrections automatically issues certificates of restoration of voting rights for any individuals who completed a qualifying sentence on or after January 1, 2010. Individuals with qualifying convictions outside of Wyoming or under federal law are required to submit a written request to the department, which issues voting rights restoration if it can confirm the individual’s eligibility. Although the total impact of the voting rights expansion is unknown, the Department of Corrections reports 3,708 Wyomians had their voting rights restored between 2014 and 2023.94\nExecutive Orders\nWhile executive orders do not permanently reform state disenfranchisement policies, governors nationwide have issued orders to restore voting rights to hundreds of thousands of people. Listed below are examples of executive actions’ impact on restoring the right to vote. Subsequent governors revoked several of these orders.\n| State | Governor | Year(s) | Rights Restored |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Florida | Gov. Charlie Crist | 2007-2011 | 150,000 |\n| Iowa | Gov. Tom Vislack | 2005 | 100,000 |\n| Iowa | Gov. Kim Reynolds | 2020 | 20,000 |\n| Kentucky | Gov. Steve Beshear | 2015 | 100,000 |\n| Kentucky | Gov. Andy Beshear | 2019 | 140,000 |\n| New York | Gov. Andrew Cuomo | 2018 | 35,000 |\n| Virginia | Gov. Terry McAuliffe | 2016-2018 | 173,000 |\n| Viginia | Gov. Ralph Northam | 2021 | 69,000 |\n| Virginia | Gov. Glen Youngkin | 2023 | 3,500 |\nMomentum for Reform\nThe right to vote in prison is recognized as an essential democratic practice both inside and outside of the United States. Indeed, the European Court of Human Rights affirmed in 2005 that bans on voting in prison violate the European Convention on Human Rights. Nearly half of European countries allow incarcerated people to vote, and Canada, Israel, and South Africa have ruled it unconstitutional to ban voting based on conviction status.95 There is no organized opposition to felony enfranchisement in any of these localities; nor is there such opposition in Maine, Vermont, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, where people convicted of felonies never lose their right to vote. In these jurisdictions, people in prisons can register (and remain registered) at their pre-incarceration address and can request absentee ballots by mail.96 Public opinion polls show that a majority – 56% of likely American voters – support voting rights for people completing their sentence inside and outside of prison.97\nIn recent years, various U.S. states and localities have worked to facilitate voting access by allowing in-person voting via polling stations at prisons or jails. In Puerto Rico, more than 6,100 people in prison voted in the 2016 Republican primary (the last known data available) where they comprised one-sixth of voters who cast their ballots.98 Officials in California, Colorado, Illinois, Texas, and Washington, DC have authorized polling stations at local jails while federal officials facilitated absentee voting for eligible voters in Bureau of Prison facilities.99\nWhile the reforms that occurred in 1997-2023 are encouraging, much work remains to be done to end felony disenfranchisement and guarantee the right to vote for all Americans.\nAppendix: progress advancing voting in jails\nIn local jails, the vast majority of citizens are eligible to vote because they are not currently serving a sentence for a felony conviction. Generally, people incarcerated in jail are unconvicted, sentenced to misdemeanor offenses, or sentenced and awaiting transfer to state prison. Of the more than 636,000 individuals incarcerated in jail as of 2021, over 451,000 were unconvicted. Of the 185,000 who were serving a sentence, nearly 20% were serving a misdemeanor sentence.100 In recent years, state and local officials along with civil rights, democracy advocates, and criminal legal reform groups have worked to guarantee ballot access for eligible voters in local jails.\n- Colorado – Colorado law authorizes voting for persons held pretrial or sentenced to a misdemeanor. Colorado’s Secretary of State requires county clerks to submit a plan developed with county sheriffs on how eligible incarcerated people can register and vote from jail. In 2019, amendments were made to the Colorado Election Rules requiring county clerks to document ballot access for incarcerated residents.101\n- Maryland – Incarcerated people in Maryland can vote in jail if they are pretrial or completing a misdemeanor sentence. In 2021, state lawmakers enacted measures to guarantee voting rights for persons incarcerated in local jails. House Bill 222, the Value My Vote Act, contains several provisions such as requiring the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services to provide a voter registration application to eligible incarcerated persons.102 Lawmakers also passed Senate Bill 525, guaranteeing ballot access at the Baltimore City centralized booking facility by providing a secure, designated ballot drop box for people eligible to vote.103\n- Massachusetts – In 2022, Republican Governor Charlie Baker signed Senate Bill 2554, the VOTES Act, into law. The comprehensive voting rights bill included provisions expanding ballot access in jails such as displaying posters explaining voting rights and procedures and written forms to distribute to everyone who may be eligible to vote. The law also directs jails to “ensure the receipt, private voting, where possible, and return of mail ballots.” It also requires sheriffs to track the number of people incarcerated in their jails who sought to vote, any complaints related to voting issues, and the outcome of those requests.104\n- Nevada – In 2023, Nevada lawmakers passed Assembly Bill 286 to make an electronic absentee ballot system (currently used by individuals who are disabled or overseas) available to people who are pretrial in county and city jails. The bill also establishes a statewide process for same-day voter registration for those eligible to vote while incarcerated.105\n| 1. | Nellis, A. (2023). Mass Incarceration Trends.

In 2022, an estimated 4.4 million Americans, representing 2 percent of the voting-age population, will be ineligible to vote due to these laws or policies, many of which date back to the post-Reconstruction era. In this election year, as the United States confronts questions about the stability of its democracy and the fairness of its elections, particularly within marginalized communities, the impact of voting bans on people with felony convictions should be front and center in the debate.\nThis 2022 report updates and expands upon 20 years of work chronicling the scope and distribution of felony disenfranchisement in the United States (see Uggen, Larson, Shannon, and Pulido-Nava 2020; Uggen, Larson, and Shannon 2016; Uggen, Shannon, and Manza 2012; Manza and Uggen 2006; Uggen and Manza 2002). As in 2020, we present national and state estimates of the number and percentage of people disenfranchised due to felony convictions, as well as the number and percentage of the Black and Latinx populations impacted. Although these and other estimates must be interpreted with caution, the numbers presented here represent our best assessment of the state of felony disenfranchisement as of the November 2022 election.\nAmong the report’s key findings:\n- An estimated 4.4 million people are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction, a figure that has declined by 24 percent since 2016, as more states enacted policies to curtail this practice and state prison populations declined modestly. Previous research finds there were an estimated 1.2 million people disenfranchised in 1976, 3.3 million in 1996, 4.7 million in 2000, 5.4 million in 2004, 5.9 million in 2010, 6.1 million in 2016, and 5.2 million in 2020.\n- One out of 50 adult citizens – 2 percent of the total U.S. voting eligible population – is disenfranchised due to a current or previous felony conviction.\n- Three out of four people disenfranchised are living in their communities, having fully completed their sentences or remaining supervised while on probation or parole.\n- In two states – Alabama and Tennessee – more than 8 percent of the adult population, one of every 13 adults, is disenfranchised.\n- Florida remains the nation’s disenfranchisement leader in absolute numbers, with over 1.1 million people currently banned from voting, often because they cannot afford to pay court-ordered monetary sanctions. An estimated 934,500 Floridians who have completed their sentences remain disenfranchised, despite a 2018 ballot referendum that promised to restore their voting rights.\n- One in 19 African Americans of voting age is disenfranchised, a rate 3.5 times that of non-African Americans. Among the adult African American population, 5.3 percent is disenfranchised compared to 1.5 percent of the adult non-African American population.\n- More than one in 10 African American adults is disenfranchised in seven states – Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Virginia.\n- Although data on ethnicity in correctional populations are unevenly reported and undercounted in some states, a conservative estimate is that at least 506,000 Latinx Americans or 1.7 percent of the voting eligible population are disenfranchised.\n- Approximately 1 million women are disenfranchised, comprising over one-fifth of the total disenfranchised population.\nState Disenfranchisement Reforms\nTo compile estimates of disenfranchised populations, we take into account new U.S. Census data on voting eligible populations1 and recent changes in state-level disenfranchisement laws and policies, including those reported in Felony Disenfranchisement: A Primer (Chung 2019) and Expanding the Vote (Porter 2010; McLeod 2018). Since January 1, 2020, laws or policy changes took effect in 8 states, expanding voting rights to some nonincarcerated people: California (parole), Connecticut (parole), Iowa (post-sentence, with exception for homicide), New Jersey (probation and parole), New York (parole), North Carolina (probation and parole), Virginia (post-prison), and Washington (post-prison). Other states have revised their waiting periods and streamlined the process for regaining civil rights. In November 2018, Florida voters passed Amendment 4 to the Constitution of Florida by ballot initiative, which allowed most people who have completed their sentences to vote (with the exception of people convicted of sex offenses and murder). In 2019, however, the Florida legislature passed and the Governor signed Senate Bill 7066, restricting the voting rights of people who had not paid court-ordered monetary sanctions, and effectively “redisenfranchising” the majority of those whose rights were restored by Amendment 4.\nAs shown in Table 1, Maine and Vermont remain the only states that allow persons in prison to vote (as well as the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico). Twenty-six U.S. states deny voting rights to people on felony-level probation or parole. In the most extreme cases, 11 states continue to deny voting rights to some or all of the individuals who have successfully fulfilled their prison, parole, or probation sentences.\n| No restrictions (2) | Prison only (22) | Prison, parole, & probation (15) | Prison, parole, probation, & post-sentence (11) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Maine | California (3) | Alaska | Alabama (1) |\n| Vermont | Colorado | Arkansas | Arizona (2) |\n| Connecticut (4) | Georgia | Delaware (5) | |\n| Hawaii | Idaho | Florida (6) | |\n| Illinois | Kansas | Iowa (7) | |\n| Indiana | Louisiana (9) | Kentucky (8) | |\n| Maryland | Minnesota | Mississippi (10) | |\n| Massachusetts | Missouri | Nebraska (11) | |\n| Michigan | New Mexico | Tennessee (14) | |\n| Montana | Oklahoma | Virginia (15) | |\n| Nevada | South Carolina | Wyoming (17) | |\n| New Hampshire | South Dakota | ||\n| New Jersey | Texas | ||\n| New York (12) | West Virginia | ||\n| North Carolina (13) | Wisconsin | ||\n| North Dakota | |||\n| Ohio | |||\n| Oregon | |||\n| Pennsylvania | |||\n| Rhode Island | |||\n| Utah | |||\n| Washington (16) |\nNotes regarding recent changes and state-specific post-sentence disenfranchisement rules:\n- Alabama – In 2016, legislation eased the rights restoration process after completion of sentence for persons not convicted of a\ncrime of “moral turpitude.” The state codified the list of felony offenses that are ineligible for re-enfranchisement in 2017. - Arizona – Permanently disenfranchises persons with two or more felony convictions. In 2019, removed the requirement to pay\noutstanding fines before rights are automatically restored for first time felony offenses only. - California – In 2020, California Proposition 17 was approved and restored voting rights to people on parole.\n- Connecticut – In 2021, Gov. Ned Lamont signed legislation restoring voting rights to people on parole. Connecticut does\ndisenfranchise parolees and felony probationers convicted of election-related offenses. - Delaware – In 2013, removed the five-year waiting period to regain voting eligibility. Apart from some disqualifying offenses, people convicted of a felony are now eligible to vote upon completion of sentence and supervision.\n- Florida – In 2018, voters passed an amendment to restore voting rights to most people after sentence completion. In 2019,\nlegislation was passed that made restoration conditional on payment of all restitution, fees, and fines. As of October 2020, only the rights of those who had paid all legal financial obligations (fines and fees) had been restored. - Iowa – In 2020, Governor Reynolds signed an executive order restoring voting rights to people who have completed their sentences, except for those convicted of homicide. This follows previous executive orders from Governor Vilsack (restoring voting rights to individuals who had completed their sentences in 2005) and Governor Branstad (reversing this executive order in 2011).\n- Kentucky – In 2019, Governor A. Beshear issued an executive order restoring voting rights to those who had completed sentences for nonviolent offenses. This follows a similar 2015 executive order by Governor S. Beshear, which had been rescinded by Governor Bevin later that year.\n- Louisiana – In 2019, House Bill 265 went into effect, restoring voting rights for residents serving probation or parole sentences\nwho have not been incarcerated within the past five years. Some sources count Louisiana among the states that have fully reenfranchised people on probation (see, e.g., https://www.voiceoftheexperienced.org/voting-rights, although most interpret\nLouisiana’s law as continuing to restrict the voting rights of a small percentage of Louisiana’s current probation population). - Mississippi – Permanently disenfranchises individuals convicted of certain offenses.\n- Nebraska – In 2005, reduced its indefinite ban on post-sentence voting to a two-year waiting period.\n- New York – In 2021, Governor Cuomo signed legislation restoring voting rights automatically upon release from prison.\n- North Carolina – After a series of court rulings, people who are not serving felony sentences in jail or prison may register to vote\nas of July 27, 2022. Further appeals are pending. See https://appellate.nccourts.org/dockets.php?court=1&docket=1-2021-0331-\n001&pdf=1&a=0&dev=1 - Tennessee – Disenfranchises those convicted of certain felonies since 1981, in addition to those convicted of select crimes prior to 1973. Others must apply to the Board of Probation and Parole for restoration.\n- Virginia – In 2020, an Executive Order automatically restored voting rights for many people upon release from prison and provided an application process for restoration as long as not incarcerated for a felony conviction.\n- Washington – In 2021, Governor Inslee signed legislation restoring voting rights to people convicted of felonies automatically after release from prison.\n- Wyoming – In 2017, restored voting rights after five years to people who complete sentences for first-time, non-violent felony\nconvictions.\nMethodology\nWe estimated the number of people released from prison and those who have completed their terms of parole or probation based on demographic life tables for each state, as described in Uggen, Manza, and Thompson (2006) and Shannon et al. (2017). We modeled each state’s disenfranchisement rate in accordance with its distinctive felony voting laws and policies, as listed in Table 1. For example, some states impose disenfranchisement for two years after release from supervision, some states only disenfranchise\nthose convicted of multiple felonies, and some only disenfranchise those convicted of violent offenses.2\nIn brief, we compiled demographic life tables for the years 1948-2022 to determine the number of released individuals lost to recidivism (and therefore already included in our annual head counts) and to mortality each year. This allows us to estimate the number of individuals who have completed their sentences in a given state and year who are no longer under correctional supervision yet remain disenfranchised. Our duration-specific recidivism rate estimates are derived from large-scale national studies of recidivism for people released from prison (e.g., Antenangeli and Durose 2021 and previous USDOJ reports in this series) and people leaving probation (e.g., USDOJ 1992). Based on these studies, our models assume that most released individuals will be re-incarcerated (66 percent) and a smaller percentage of those on probation or in jail (57 percent) will return through the criminal legal system. We also assume a substantially higher mortality rate for people convicted of felony offenses relative to the rest of the population. Both people returning to the system and deaths are removed from the post-sentence pool to avoid overestimating the number of individuals in the population who have completed their sentences. Each release cohort is thus reduced each successive year – at a level commensurate with the age-adjusted hazard rate for mortality and duration-adjusted hazard rate for recidivism – and added to each new cohort of releases. Overall, we produced more than 200 spreadsheets covering 76 years of data.3 These provide the figures needed to compile disenfranchisement rate estimates that are keyed to the appropriate correctional populations for each state and year.4 5 6\nThe disenfranchisement of incarcerated people is one of the biggest obstacles to criminal justice reform that our country faces. When an individual is behind bars, they are effectively voiceless. They do not have the ability to change the system that has harmed them. But by giving people behind the wall an opportunity to cast their ballot, we can give them their voice back. We can give them a say in the system that has led to their own imprisonment.\nDisenfranchisement in 2022\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of the 4.4 million disenfranchised individuals across correctional populations estimated. More than three out of four people disenfranchised are living in their communities, either while supervised on probation or parole or after having fully completed their sentences. The largest proportion of the disenfranchised population, almost half (48%) have fully completed their sentence. People currently in prison and jail now represent about 24 percent of those disenfranchised. The data reported are based on estimates, rather than head counts and population counts in prison, probation, and parole, as such counts have been exceptionally unstable during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nFigure 1. Disenfranchisement Distribution Across Correctional Populations, 2022\nVariation Across States\nDue to differences in state laws and policies and rates of criminal punishment, states vary widely in the practice of disenfranchisement. These maps and tables represent the disenfranchised population as a percentage of the adult voting eligible population in each state. As noted, we estimate that almost 4.4 million Americans are currently barred from voting by state law and policy. As Figure 2 and the statistics in Table 2 show, state-level disenfranchisement rates in 2022 varied from 0.15 percent in Massachusetts (and zero in Maine and Vermont) to more than 8 percent in Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee.\nFigure 2. Total Felony Disenfranchisement Rates, 2022\nSee the note on Mississippi at the top of the webpage.\nThese figures reflect significant but uneven change in recent decades. Although half of the states have scaled back voting restrictions for people with felony convictions, several others – particularly Southeastern states – have retained such restrictions and their disenfranchised populations have increased commensurate with the expansion of the criminal legal system. Figure 3 displays disenfranchisement rates in 1980, when the national disenfranchisement rate was 1.0 percent. At that time, far more of the nation had disenfranchisement rates of approximately 0.5 percent. Alabama had the nation’s highest rate of disenfranchisement at just under 5 percent, but no state disenfranchised more than 5 percent of its adult citizens.\nFigure 3. Total Felony Disenfranchisement Rates, 1980\nSee the note on Mississippi at the top of the webpage.\nThe cartogram in Figure 4 provides another way to visualize the impact of these policies by highlighting the large regional differences in felony disenfranchisement laws and policies. Cartograms distort the land area on the map under an alternative statistic, in this case the total felony disenfranchisement rate. Southeastern states appear bloated because they disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of people who have completed their sentences. In contrast, many Northeastern and Midwestern states shrink because they limit disenfranchisement to individuals currently in prison, or not at all. This distorted map thus provides a clear visual representation of the great range of differences and regional variation in the scope and impact of felony disenfranchisement across the 50 states.\nFigure 4. Cartogram of Total Disenfranchisement Rates by State, 2022\nSee the note on Mississippi at the top of the webpage.\nTrends Over Time\nFigure 5 illustrates the historical trend in U.S. disenfranchisement resulting from a felony conviction, showing growth in the disenfranchised population for selected years from 1960 to 2022. The number disenfranchised dropped from approximately 1.8 million to 1.2 million between 1960 and 1976, as states expanded voting rights in the civil rights era. Many states have pared back their disenfranchisement provisions since the 1970s (see Behrens, Uggen, and Manza, 2003; Manza and Uggen, 2006), a trend that has accelerated in the past 5 years. The total disenfranchised population rose from 3.3 million in 1996 to 4.7 million in 2000, to 5.4 million in 2004, to 5.9 million in 2010, and 6.1 million in 2016. Today, we estimate that over 4.4 million Americans are disenfranchised by virtue of a felony conviction. Roughly the same number of voters will be disenfranchised in the 2022 election as in 2000 – a closely contested presidential election that drew national attention to the disenfranchisement of people with felony-level criminal records in Florida and across the country (Uggen and Manza 2002; but see Burch 2012; Klumpp et al. 2019).\nFigure 5. Number Disenfranchised for Selected Years, 1960-2022\nVariation by Race and Ethnicity\nDisenfranchisement rates vary widely across racial and ethnic groups, such that felony disenfranchisement provisions have an outsized impact on communities of color. Ethnicity data in particular have not been consistently collected or reported in the data sources used to compile our estimates, so our ability to construct these estimates is limited. This is especially the case for Latinx populations, who now constitute a significant portion of criminal justice populations. Race data on criminal justice populations is more complete, and we have used the most recent data available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics to develop a complete set of state-specific disenfranchisement estimates for the African American voting eligible population (Figures 6 and 7). We first show a map of the African American disenfranchisement rate for 1980, and then show how the picture looks today. By 1980, the African American disenfranchisement rate already exceeded 10 percent of the adult population in states such as Arizona and Iowa, as shown in Figure 6. The figure also indicates that several Southeastern states disenfranchised more than 5 percent of their adult African American populations at that time.\nFigure 6. African American Felony Disenfranchisement Rates, 1980\nSee the note on Mississippi at the top of the webpage.\nFigure 7 shows the corresponding rates for 2022, again retaining a common scale and shading to keep the map consistent with the 1980 map (Figure 6). African American disenfranchisement rates in Tennessee and Mississippi now exceed 15 percent of the adult voting eligible population. Whereas 9 states disenfranchised at least 5 percent of their African American adult citizens in 1980, 17 states do so today.\nFigure 7. African American Felony Disenfranchisement Rates, 2022\nSee the note on Mississippi at the top of the webpage.\nData are limited regarding ethnicity, but more states are now consistently reporting Latinx ethnicity for justice-involved populations. We therefore compiled estimates for these populations but present them with the caveat that these figures likely undercount the true rate of Latinx disenfranchisement in many states. Although data on Latinx ethnicity in correctional populations are still unevenly reported, we can conservatively estimate that at least 506,000 Latinx Americans (1.7 percent of the voting eligible population) are disenfranchised. In Arizona and Tennessee over 6 percent of Latinx voters are disenfranchised due to felony-level convictions. Even with the likely undercounting, 31 states report a higher rate of disenfranchisement in the Latinx population than in the general population. Many of those disenfranchised today were convicted at a time when the Latinx population was significantly smaller than it is today. Because the overall U.S. Latinx population has quadrupled since 1980, we anticipate that Latinx disenfranchisement will comprise an increasing share of those disenfranchised due to felony convictions in coming years.\nFigure 8. Latinx Felony Disenfranchisement Rates (Available Data), 2022\nSee the note on Mississippi at the top of the webpage.\nSex and Disenfranchisement\nTo estimate the percentage of disenfranchised male and female voters, we compiled national prison, probation, parole and jail statistics, and prepared a national life table to obtain the post-sentence gender distribution. By this method, we estimate that approximately 1.0 million women are disenfranchised in 2022, making up over one-fifth of the total disenfranchised population.\nEvery single day in U.S. jails and prisons, women are subjected to or witness verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. There are systems in place that are supposed to address these issues, but nevertheless, these incidents continue. It often seems that our system is entirely fixated on how much punishment can be meted out on each individual person. The only way to upset this system is to connect those most impacted by it – incarcerated people – to their elected officials via the ballot. That ability to vote gives them the power they need to change an unjust system. It gives them a say in the conditions in which they live.\nRecent Changes\nThe total disenfranchisement rate in 2022 (1.99 percent) shows a decline relative to the figures our team reported in 2020 (2.27 percent) and 2016 (2.47 percent), due largely to state changes in disenfranchisement laws and policies but also in part due to the decline in state prison and jail populations during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our estimates for African American disenfranchisement in 2022 are also lower than for previous years: 5.28 percent, versus 6.26 percent in 2020, 7.44 percent in 2016, 7.66 percent in 2010, and 8.25 percent in 2004. For the 2022 estimates, we used American Community Survey data to obtain denominators for the African American voting eligible population. Our estimates are based on race-specific recidivism rates that reflect current scholarship on punishment and recidivism. This results in a higher rate of attrition in our life tables, but produces a more conservative and, we believe, more accurate portrait of the number of disenfranchised African Americans. Though lower than in previous years, the 5.3 percent rate of disenfranchisement for African Americans remains 3.5 times that of the non-African American rate of 1.5 percent.\nFlorida deserves special mention, in light of the size of its disenfranchised population and the scope of recent legal and policy changes in that state. In 2018, Florida voters approved Amendment 4, which restored voting rights to people who had completed their sentences. The following year, however, Senate Bill 7066 was signed into law, conditioning restoration of voting rights on payment of outstanding monetary sanctions. Firm estimates are therefore more difficult to produce for Florida than for other states. Based on our assumptions regarding the share of post-sentence residents with outstanding legal financial obligations (fines, fees, and restitution), we estimate that over 934,500 people who have completed their sentence remain disenfranchised in that state.7\nAs detailed in the notes to Table 1, there have been numerous other significant changes in state disenfranchisement laws and policies since our last report in 2020. Since January of that year, law and policy changes have been implemented in at least 8 states, restoring the vote to people currently on probation and parole in New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington; to people on parole in California, Connecticut, and New York; and to many people who had completed their sentences in Virginia and Iowa.\nRestoration of Voting Rights Since 2020 Report\nApart from legal changes that have re-enfranchised people whose convictions or supervision status meet certain criteria, states also provide some limited mechanism for disenfranchised persons to restore their right to vote. These vary greatly in scope, eligibility requirements, and reporting practices. It is thus difficult to obtain consistent information about the rate and number of disenfranchised Americans whose rights are restored through these generally administrative procedures. Nevertheless, as we have done in previous reports, we contacted each of the appropriate state agencies by email and phone and compiled the information they made available to us. We then subtracted all known restorations of civil rights (including full pardons) from each state’s total disenfranchised post-sentence figure in each of the 11 states that disenfranchise beyond sentence completion. Even accounting for these restorations, it is clear that those whose rights are restored by these processes represent a relatively small fraction of the total disenfranchised population in most states (for previous years, see Uggen, Larson, and Shannon, 2016; Uggen, Larson, Shannon, and Pulido-Nava 2020).8\nAfter surviving 28 years in prison, I am a clemency recipient. I will be able to vote for the first time in the midterm election. Participating in voting makes me feel like I’m a part of my community, like I belong here.\nOutstanding Monetary Sanctions\nIn addition to Florida, other states partly condition re-enfranchisement on payment of outstanding fines, fees, court costs, and restitution. With regard to the categories in Table 1, Margaret Love and David Schlussel (2020) note that Arkansas, Connecticut, Kansas, South Dakota, and Texas appear to disenfranchise some people post-sentence, on the basis of unpaid legal financial obligations. They also identify Georgia in this category, but the Georgia Secretary of State’s office clarified in 2020 that anyone who has completed their sentence, even if they owe outstanding monetary debt, can vote (Niesse 2020). According to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, fines that were a condition of probation are automatically cancelled upon completion of probation. Arkansas requires payment of court costs, fines, and restitution; South Dakota requires payment of fines, fees, and restitution; and Texas requires payment of fines. Three states in addition to Florida condition eligibility for re-enfranchisement on payment of some or all legal financial obligations. Alabama conditions re-enfranchisement after a first felony on payment of fines, fees, court costs, and victim restitution; Arizona conditions restoration after a first felony on payment of restitution; and Tennessee conditions restoration on payment of restitution, court costs (unless a finding of indigency was made), and child support. Kentucky requires repayment of restitution to be eligible to apply for restoration of civil rights. Iowa conditions eligibility for re-enfranchisement for people convicted of homicide crimes before July 4, 2005 on repayment of court costs, restitution, and fines (or being current on a payment plan). The scope and enforcement of such restrictions varies greatly across these states, such that we cannot provide firm estimates on the number of people impacted. Nevertheless, they could serve as an additional driver of disenfranchisement, above and beyond the restrictions reported in Table 1 and the numbers reported in Tables 2, 3, and 4.\nImmigration Status\nThe figures we present include estimates of the number and percentage of people disenfranchised due to a felony conviction, although some people are also ineligible to vote for other reasons, including immigration status. We lack good data on the number of people who are ineligible to vote due to both conviction status and immigration status, but current prison populations provide a baseline to estimate the magnitude of this population. As of December 31, 2020, 45 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that 58,100 non-U.S. citizens were held in state or federal U.S. prisons (USDOJ, 2021). This represents about 4.9 percent of the total state and federal prison population (1,215,800) on this date. About half of this number (24,000) were held in federal institutions and an additional 17,400 were in custody in four states (Texas, Florida, Arizona, and Georgia).\nProsecuted for Voting\nAlongside movements to limit the expansion of voting rights restoration in recent years, some states have also demonstrated a renewed interest in prosecuting people for voting while ineligible because of a felony conviction. Florida, for example, established a new election crime and security unit in July 2022, announcing the impending arrest of 20 individuals for voting while they were under supervision in 2020 (Lopez 2022; Office of Governor Ron DeSantis 2022; Rozsa and Craig 2022).\nBut recent cases have demonstrated how confusing disenfranchisement laws and policies can be for both voters and government officials. The prosecution of Crystal Mason, a Black woman in Texas, was in the national spotlight when she was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of attempting to vote while ineligible.9 Mason was serving a supervised release sentence after her release from prison for felony tax fraud when she cast a provisional ballot in the 2016 election. Throughout the trial, Mason maintained she did not know she was ineligible to vote, and her probation officer acknowledged he never told Mason she was ineligible. Mason appealed her conviction, and in May 2022 the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that the trial court “erred by failing to require proof that the Appellant had actual knowledge that it was a crime for her to vote while on supervised release” and sent the case back for review.10\nIn a more recent case in Tennessee, a Black Lives Matter activist named Pamela Moses was convicted of illegally registering to vote and sentenced to six years in prison (Medina 2022).11 In 2019, believing she had completed her felony probation from a prior tampering with evidence conviction, Moses decided to run for office (Levine 2022). But when election officials told her she was not eligible because of her felony, she first went to the court and later to her probation office to determine her status. The court told her she was still on probation, but her probation office provided Moses with a signed certificate of restoration confirming she had completed her sentence and her rights had been restored,12 which Moses submitted when she registered at the local election office (Levine 2022). However, both Moses and the probation office were mistaken as Moses was still on court-ordered probation.13 Further, the confusing nature of Tennessee’s disenfranchisement laws and policies was on display when her probation officer and the probation supervisor acknowledged at trial they were unaware that Moses’ prior tampering conviction was one of the few felony convictions in Tennessee that made her ineligible for restoration of voting rights. As seen in this transcript excerpt from the trial,14 the trial judge echoed this confusion:\nPROSECUTOR: …The tampering with evidence we’re addressing today, which is permanent. I don’t remember all the ones. I know murder, probably rape–\nTHE COURT: That’s something I didn’t know. Are you telling me if you get convicted of tampering with evidence, you can never vote?… Where is that in the law?\n….\nDEFENSE: It’s titled– …. I think it’s 39-15 or 39-17 where it talks about the interference with government operations. Those are–\n….\nPROSECUTOR: It’s 40-29-204.\n….\nTHE COURT: “Those convicted after July 1, 1996, but before July 1, 2006–those convicted after July 1, 2006, any of the offenses set forth in one and two above, voter fraud, treason, murder in the first degree, aggravated rape.” And then it goes on to say, “Any other violation of title chapter part one, four, and five, designated as a felony”– so are you telling me I’ve got to go back and look at 39-16?\n….\nPROSECUTOR: Yes. Now you have to, and that’s where the tampering with evidence, along with–it falls under, like, bribery, contraband, false pretense, the ones that are felonies.\nTo be sure, these cases are not typical, and there is no empirical evidence that voting or registering while ineligible is anything but rare (Levitt 2007; Minnite 2010). Yet prosecutions for voting while ineligible may have a chilling effect on political participation more generally, with the potential to intimidate recently re-enfranchised voters and suppress the vote.\nThis practice is not unique to the aforementioned states. For example, our team conducted an original analysis of sentencing data of all voting or registering while ineligible convictions in Minnesota from 2000 to 2019 (Uggen and Stewart 2022). In that period spanning five presidential elections, 243 people were convicted of voting while ineligible (or 0.0008% out of 28,662,749 votes cast) and 134 were convicted of registering while ineligible. The majority of the prosecutions (147) came after the 2008 election, following an effort by a now-defunct local voter integrity organization to prove massive voter fraud. The organization identified 2,803 people they suspected of having voted illegally to county attorneys throughout the state, but prosecutors determined that 95 percent of these were either eligible to vote or there was not enough evidence to pursue charges. Compared to the Minnesotans convicted of all felony crimes, those convicted of voting or registering illegally were more likely to be women (32% versus 21%) and far more likely to be Black (38% versus 23%). One individual had served 9 years and 10 months of a 10-year probation sentence when he was charged with a new felony for voting. Others had been on probation for a decade or more. Many of those charged in Minnesota were on probation for lower-level offenses, such as drug possession, theft, writing bad checks, and violation of public assistance rules. Such aggressive prosecution for voting while ineligible may represent a form of “democratic backsliding” in some states (see, e.g., Grumbach 2022) – one made possible by broad restrictions on the rights of people with criminal records.\nSummary\nThis report provides new state-level estimates on felony disenfranchisement for 2022 and updates those provided by Uggen, Larson, and Shannon (2020) for previous years. In Tables 2, 3, and 4, we provide state-specific point estimates of the total disenfranchised population, the African American disenfranchised population, and the Latinx disenfranchised population, subject to the caveats described below.\nDespite significant legal changes in recent decades, and declining state prison and jail populations during the Covid-19 pandemic, about 4.6 million Americans are disenfranchised due to criminal convictions in 2022. This number has declined an impressive 24 percent since 2016, when 6.1 million were disenfranchised. Levels of disenfranchisement today are closer in absolute number to the 4.69 million who were denied the vote in 2000, when disenfranchisement may have played an important part in a closely contested presidential election. When we break these figures down by race and ethnicity, it is clear that disparities in the criminal justice system are linked to disparities in political representation, as 5.3 percent of the African American voting eligible population is currently disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. The distribution of disenfranchised individuals shown in Figure 1 also bears repeating: less than one-fourth of this population is currently incarcerated, and over 3.5 million adults who live in their communities are banned from voting. The significant reforms implemented in the past six years have helped to restore the rights of almost 1.5 million voters, yet 4.6 million still remain locked out.\nUnderstanding the Numbers and Assumptions\nWe have taken care to produce estimates of current populations and “post-sentence” populations that are reliable and valid by social science standards. Nevertheless, readers should bear in mind that our state-specific figures for the 11 states that bar individuals from voting after they have completed their sentences remain point estimates rather than actual head counts. In addition, the prison, probation, parole, and jail populations we report for 2022 are also estimated, based on year-end 2020 (or 2018 for jail populations) data and the recent state-specific trends in each state. In other work, we have presented figures that adjust or “bound” these estimates by assuming different levels of recidivism, inter-state mobility, and state-specific variation. With these caveats in mind, the results reported here present our best account of the prevalence of U.S. disenfranchisement in 2022. These estimates will be adjusted if and when we discover errors or omissions in the data compiled from individual states, U.S. Census and Bureau of Justice Statistics sources, or in our own spreadsheets and estimation procedures. Importantly, our estimates only estimate the number of individuals legally disenfranchised based upon current state law and policies. Our estimates do not include aspects of “practical” or de facto disenfranchisement – wherein individuals legally allowed to vote do not do so due to legal ambiguity, misinformation regarding voting eligibility, fear of an illegal voting conviction, among other reasons related to criminal records and voting. In other words, the estimates here do not reflect any “chilling” effects that disenfranchisement laws and their enforcement may have.\n| State | Prison | Parole | Felony probation | Jail |

The Sentencing Project retracts all Mississippi estimates regarding disenfranchisement by reason of criminal conviction, as these estimates were calculated assuming that all felonies in Mississippi are disenfranchising, when in fact, only a subset of felonies that appear on an enumerated list should be considered in this calculation. The actual size of Mississippi’s disenfranchised population is significantly smaller than we estimated; we will publish corrected estimates in our 2024 report. The Sentencing Project does not retract its conclusion that Black Mississippians continue to be disproportionately impacted by Mississippi’s disenfranchisement scheme. In a 2018 case that challenged Mississippi disenfranchisement law (Hopkins et al. v. Hosemann, No. 3:18-cv-188-CWR-LRA [S.D. Miss. 2018]), the plaintiffs’ expert witness, Dr. Dov Rothman estimated nearly 50,000 Mississippians were convicted of at least one disenfranchising offense from 1994 to 2017. However, these estimates do not take into account mortality or those who were disenfranchised prior to 1994 or outside of that period.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Nick Dickens and Caleigh Lueder of the University of Minnesota, and Molly Hauf of Hamline University for their invaluable research assistance in compiling this report.\nReferences\nAntenangeli, Leonardo, and Matthew R.

For early years, we also referenced National Prisoner Statistics, and Race of Prisoners Admitted to State and Federal Institutions, 1926-1986. We determined the median age of released prisoners based on annual data from the National Corrections Reporting Program. The recidivism rate we use to decrease the releasee population each year is based upon Bureau of Justice Statistics (1989) “Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983 and a 10-year follow-up of prisoners released in 2008 (Antenangeli and Durose 2021) and “Recidivism of Felons on Probation 1986-1989.” For those in prison or on parole, we use a reincarceration rate of 18.6 percent at one year, 32.8 percent at two years, 41.4 percent at 3 years. Although rearrest rates have increased since 1983, the overall reconviction and reincarceration rates used for this study are much more stable (Langan and Levin (2002), p. 11). For those on probation or in jail, the corresponding three-year failure rate is 36 percent, |\n| 4. | The current prison, parole, and probation counts come from the Bureau of Justice Statistics annual corrections reports.

We assume that 90 percent of people currently on parole and 10 percent of people currently serving felony-level probation sentences have been incarcerated in prison within the previous five years or convicted of a disqualifying offense, and are therefore disenfranchised. |\n| 7. | Our statistics for Florida assume that 67 percent of the total Florida post-sentence population has outstanding legal financial obligations or other restrictions that would disqualify them from restoration of civil rights under current Florida law and administrative practices (see Florida Commission on Offender Review, Rules of Executive Clemency 2022). We also estimated the post-sentence disenfranchised population that assume both higher and lower rates of ineligibility due to monetary sanctions. Under the assumption that 50 percent of the population is currently voting-eligible, the post-prison disenfranchised population would be 643,000; under the assumption that only 25 percent of the population is currently voting-eligible, the post-prison disenfranchised population would be over 1,068,000. |\n| 8. | Alabama reported 3,861 restorations in 2020 and 2021; the Arizona Board of Executive Clemency reported 0 pardons granted for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022; Delaware reported 589 pardons and commutations for 2020, 2021, and through 6/16/22; Florida did not respond to our 2022 requests but in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 the Florida Commission on Offender Review reported 4,244 and 6,278 applications completed, respectively.

To extend the analysis to subsequent years, we calculated a trend line using the ratio of increases provided by Hoffman and Stone-Meierhoefer (1980) on federal prisoners. By year 10, we estimate a 59.4 percent recidivism rate among released prisoners and parolees, which increases to 65.9 percent by year 62 (the longest observation period in this analysis). Because these estimates are higher than most long-term recidivism studies, they are likely to yield conservative estimates of the formerly incarcerated population. We apply the same trend line to the 3-year\nprobation and jail recidivism rate of 36 percent; by year 62, the recidivism rate is 57.3 percent. 1948 is the earliest year for which detailed data are available on releases from supervision.\nfor the life tables) were available until year end 2020 (with the exception of the proportion felony probation which is only current in the BJS until 2016), and jail counts were available until year end 2018. Our previous reports extrapolated these numbers to the focal election year, but we assume greater stability in this year’s estimates due to the pandemic related instability of prison and jail populations from 2020-2022. We therefore do not carry forward the 2020 changes in corrections due to the COVD-19 pandemic into the future, which are captured in the BJS changes from 2019 to 2020. Current population counts were validated against preliminary\nstate and national prison reports from the Vera Institute for Winter 2021-22 (Kang-Brown 2022), jail reports for Spring 2021 (Kang-Brown et al. 2021), and 2022 counts from individual state departments of corrections.\nthe total reported prison populations in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, and Rhode Island downward by subtracting the estimated percentage of people who are serving non-felony sentences or awaiting trial (0.9*0.31=0.28).

Here’s What Has Changed Since 2010.\nIn late October, an audio recording leaked from a fundraising event in Georgia captured Brian Kemp, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, expressing concern about his Democratic opponent Stacy Abrams’ get out the vote efforts. In it, he pointed to her campaign’s mobilization of absentee ballots as “something that continues to concern us.” A candidate for office worrying about their opponent’s ability to get voters to the polls is nothing new, but Kemp’s comments underscored the emergence of voting rights as a contentious issue in the campaign.\nGeorgia isn’t alone. Across the country, states have become embroiled in battles over access to the vote, and the outcome could well determine who holds electoral power in America for years to come.\nSince the 2008 election, when high turnout by young voters and voters of color propelled Barack Obama to the presidency, a wave of restrictions on voting have been passed by state legislatures or put in place by state election officials. Early voting periods have been shortened, polling places shuttered, and voter ID requirements implemented that have made it more difficult to vote in many states. On the other side, voting rights advocates have challenged many of these restrictions in court — often successfully — and pushed for policies designed to increase voter turnout.\nLast updated on April 17, 2024\nAlabama\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nArkansas\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nFlorida\nShortened Early Voting Period + Imposed Restrictive Voter Registration Policies\nGeorgia\nShortened Early Voting Period + Imposed Restrictive Voter Registration Policies\nIllinois\nImposed Restrictive Voter Registration Policies\nIowa\nImposed Restrictive Voter Registration Policies\nKansas\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nMississippi\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nMissouri\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nNebraska\nShortened Early Voting Period\nNew Hampshire\nImposed Restrictive Voter Registration Policies + Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nNorth Carolina\nShortened Early Voting Period\nNorth Dakota\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nOhio\nShortened Early Voting Period\nRhode Island\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nSouth Carolina\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nTennessee\nImposed Restrictive Voter Registration / Voter ID Laws + Shortened Early Voting\nTexas\nImposed Restrictive Voter Registration Policies + Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nVirginia\nImposed Restrictive Voter Registration Policies + Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nWest Virginia\nShortened Early Voting Period + Imposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nWisconsin\nImposed Restrictive Voter Registration Policies + Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAccording to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, 24 states have imposed restrictions on voting since 2010. Eight of those states have put new restrictions in place in the two years since the last presidential election. With few exceptions, these restrictions were drawn up by Republican legislators, and they have almost uniformly had the effect of creating obstacles to voting for younger voters and people of color, who tend to lean Democratic. The false menace of voter fraud is the most common justification for this contraction of voting rights, but there are clear signs that the aim is to prevent eligible voters from reaching the polls.\nIn 2012, for example, a former GOP party chairman in Florida admitted a law restricting early voting was passed specifically because “early voting is bad for Republican Party candidates.” After similar restrictions were passed in North Carolina, a Republican Party press release explicitly celebrated a decline in early voting by Black residents. After the 2016 presidential election, Wisconsin’s Republican Attorney General credited the state’s controversial voter ID law with President Trump’s victory there. Black voters in Wisconsin were three times more likely than white voters to say that the law had made it more difficult for them to vote.\nPassage of Amendment 4 in Florida would restore voting rights to an estimated 1.4 million people\nBut voting rights advocates are pushing back. In some cases, they’ve used the courts. In Kansas, for example, the ACLU successfully blocked a state law that required individuals to provide documentary proof of citizenship, like a birth certificate or passport, to register to vote. In other cases, advocates have lobbied state legislatures to pass laws that encourage voter registration or fought to defeat new voter ID requirements. This year, a number of states have initiatives on the ballot that have the potential to make voting easier and more accessible to millions of Americans. Amendment 4 in Florida alone will give back the vote to an estimated 1.4 million state residents with felony convictions if it passes. And earlier this year, advocates won a major victory in Washington, helping to get a law passed that allows greater flexibility for communities to set the rules of local elections and prevent the marginalization of minority groups from elected offices.\nThe battle over voting rights in the U.S. has a long, bitter history, and the last few years show it’s far from settled. With crucial midterm elections coming up, these are the most prominent issues at play, along with a look at some changes made to voting rights at the state level since 2010.\nVoter Registration\nAllowing eligible voters to get their names onto state voting rolls is critical to increasing access to the polls. But policies in some states have established significant obstacles to registration. Rather than creating simplified processes that encourage easy registration, some states have adopted systems that do exactly the opposite, making it harder for voting rights advocates to help get eligible voters on the rolls.\nOn the other hand, in recent years those advocates have won big victories in some states that have streamlined registration processes. Automatic voter registration, for example, which requires anyone who interacts with a state motor vehicle department to “opt-out” of registration rather than having to tick a box to “opt-in,” has gained strong momentum in just a few years.\n15 states and D.C. allow voters to register on Election Day.\nSince 2015, 13 states—Alaska, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia—have passed automatic voter registration laws, along with the District of Columbia. Cumulatively, these laws have the potential to include hundreds of thousands of new voters onto the rolls. In Nevada, an initiative on next week’s ballot would make automatic voter registration into state law, ensuring that anyone who interacts with a wide range of state agencies will be placed onto voter rolls.\nCurrently, 15 states and the District of Columbia have policies that allow voters to register on Election Day rather than requiring them to register weeks beforehand (eight states introduced that policy since 2010). Research shows that these policies can significantly boost voter turnout. Washington has also passed election-day registration, but it will not be implemented until 2019. Initiatives on the November ballot in Maryland and Michigan would make those states the 17th and 18th in the nation to offer election-day registration if they pass. Michigan’s ballot measure, called “Promote the Vote,” would implement a broad swath of procedures to encourage voter registration, expand access to absentee ballots, and require post-election audits.\nLast updated on April 17, 2024\nCalifornia\nImplemented in or after 2010\nColorado\nImplemented in or after 2010\nConnecticut\nImplemented in or after 2010\nDistrict of Columbia\nImplemented in or after 2010\nHawaii\nImplemented in or after 2010\nIdaho\nImplemented prior to 2010\nIllinois\nImplemented in or after 2010\nIowa\nImplemented prior to 2010\nMaine\nImplemented prior to 2010\nMinnesota\nImplemented prior to 2010\nMontana\nImplemented prior to 2010\nNew Hampshire\nImplemented prior to 2010\nUtah\nImplemented in or after 2010\nVermont\nImplemented in or after 2010\nWisconsin\nImplemented prior to 2010\nWyoming\nImplemented prior to 2010\nMany states now offer online voter registration, although it is typically limited to residents with a valid state ID. Since 2010, 35 states along with D.C. have introduced online voter registration. A full list can be found here.\nBut the news isn’t all good. Here are some states that have imposed restrictive voter registration policies since 2010:\nTexas – In 2011 Republican lawmakers passed a law that made it illegal to help someone register to vote without first being “deputized” by a county board. Even after going through that process, a “Volunteer Deputy Registrar” can be charged with a felony if that person helps someone from a different state county register to vote. This law has made it nearly impossible to organize voter registration drives in the state.\nKansas – In 2011, a bill that was supported by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Kansas created a requirement that prospective voters provide documentary proof of citizenship—such as a passport or birth certificate, which many eligible voters do not possess—in order to register to vote. A federal judge ruled the requirement unconstitutional in June after a lawsuit brought by the ACLU.\nTennessee – In 2011, Republican lawmakers passed a law that allows the state to flag voters who are suspected of being non-citizens and require them to show proof of citizenship in order to cast a ballot.\nAlabama – In 2011, Republican lawmakers passed a law requiring prospective voters to show proof of citizenship before registering to vote. The requirement has not been implemented, but in 2016 the Election Assistance Commission—a federal agency that exercises a supervisory role over some election-related issues—allowed the state to require proof of citizenship for state residents who use a federal election form to register to vote. After a court challenge, the requirement was blocked.\nGeorgia – In 2016, the federal Election Assistance Commission also allowed Georgia to require proof of citizenship for state residents who use a federal election form to register to vote. After a court challenge, that requirement was also blocked pending appeal.\nOhio – In 2014, Republican lawmakers eliminated the state’s “golden week” period — a six-day window at the beginning of Ohio’s early voting period that allowed voters to register and cast their ballot on the same day. Some 80,000 voters — disproportionately from poor and minority backgrounds — made use of “golden week” in 2012. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to order Ohio to reverse the cut in 2016.\nFlorida – After the 2010 election, Republican lawmakers passed a law that imposed harsh requirements on groups conducting voter registration drives. An analysis by The New York Times in 2012 showed that the law had the effect of severely decreasing the number of new voters able to register when compared with similar periods in earlier election cycles.\nOther states that have implemented some form of restrictions on voter registration since 2010 include Wisconsin, Illinois, Virginia, Iowa, and New Hampshire. For more on these restrictions, see this map by the Brennan Center for Justice.\nVoter Purges\nWhen done properly, list maintenance of voter rolls ensures an accurate accounting of who’s eligible to vote by removing the names of people who have died or moved out of state. But maintenance can become a ‘purge’ when it arbitrarily removes large groups of voters through faulty processes. Such purges often have a disproportionate impact on voters of color.\nOne analysis carried out by Reuters, for example, found that in Ohio’s three largest counties, 144,000 voters had been stricken from the rolls between 2008 and 2016, and that “neighborhoods that have a high proportion of poor, African-American residents [were] hit hardest.”\nAnother analysis of voter purges published by the Brennan Center for Justice in July found that between 2014 and 2016, states removed nearly 16 million voters from their rolls. Disturbingly, states that were no longer subject to preclearance requirements of the Voting Rights Act after Shelby County v. Holder saw large spikes in voter purges. In Texas alone, over 350,000 more voters were purged from the rolls in the election cycle following Shelby County than in the cycle that preceded the ruling.\nAnd in Georgia, more than half a million voters were removed in 2017, including over 100,000 who simply hadn’t voted in recent elections or responded to a notice mailed by the state. The purge was supervised by Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is now running for governor.\nVoter ID Laws\nVoter ID laws typically require voters to present a photo ID at polling stations before entering the booth, and often specify that those IDs must be issued by a government agency or include a street address. In practice, voter ID requirements suppress turnout, particularly by voters of color, who are statistically less likely than white voters to have an ID that satisfies the legal requirements. Nationally, up to 25 percent of Black citizens of voting age lack government-issued photo ID, compared with only 8 percent of white citizens. Since 2010, 14 states have imposed more restrictive voter ID laws than they had previously.\nLast updated on April 17, 2024\nAlabama\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2010 election, Republican lawmakers in Alabama passed a law requiring voters to display one of a pre-approved list of photo IDs in order to vote. Similar to Mississippi, the law went into effect in 2014, after the Supreme Court’s Shelby County decision. If voters do not have an approved photo ID, they may submit a provisional ballot.\nArkansas\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2016 election, Republican lawmakers passed a voter ID requirement that will be in effect for this year’s midterms. Voters must now present a government-issued photo ID at their polling station. If they do not possess the required ID, they may cast a provisional ballot, and state election officials will decide later whether or not to count the vote. Earlier this month, the law was upheld by the state supreme court, which in 2016 had blocked a prior version that didn’t include the provisional ballot alternative. This year, a measure is on the ballot in Arkansas that would specifically allow photo ID requirements for voting, effectively ending court challenges to the law.\nIowa\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nKansas\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2010 election, Kansas Republicans passed a restrictive law that requires voters to present one from a narrow list of approved photo IDs.\nMississippi\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nIn 2011, a ballot measure was overwhelmingly approved that required voters to display photo ID to poll workers. The law took effect in 2014, after the Supreme Court gutted the “preclearance” requirement of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder. Voters must now show one of a list of pre-approved photo IDs in order to vote, or cast a provisional ballot and then bring the ID to a Circuit Clerk’s office within five days.\nMissouri\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter a protracted political battle between Republican lawmakers and the state’s Democratic governor, Missouri voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative in 2016 that requires voters to present ID from a pre-approved list. If a voter does not have acceptable ID, she may cast a provisional ballot that will be counted if acceptable ID is shown at a polling station later, or if poll workers can match the voter’s signature to the one on the voter registration form. Earlier this month, a state judge blocked a provision that would have required voters without photo ID to sign an affidavit. And the ACLU is currently suing Missouri for failing to fund programs required by the law that would provide free voter IDs and train poll workers in how to navigate its requirements.\nNew Hampshire\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2010 election, Republican lawmakers overrode a veto by the state’s Democratic governor to pass a law that requires voters to present one of a pre-approved list of photo IDs at their polling station. The law is far less strict than those in other states, allowing voters without photo ID to cast a standard ballot, provided they are willing to have their picture taken and affixed to a signed affidavit.\nNorth Dakota\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2016 election, North Dakota Republicans passed a law that requires voters to show photo ID issued by the state, a tribal government, or a North Dakota long-term care facility. The ID must include a residential street address, a requirement that could disenfranchise thousands of Native American voters, who live on reservations in rural areas and don’t have street addresses. The law allows voters to show other forms of documentation that display a residential address, including bank statements or utility bills, but many may not have that documentation because of homelessness or poverty. Voters without approved photo ID may submit a provisional ballot, but are still required to show the ID promptly for their vote to be counted.\nRhode Island\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2010 election, Democratic lawmakers in Rhode Island passed a law requiring voters to show one of a pre-approved list of photo IDs at their polling station. The law is considered less strict than those in other states—if voters lack the required ID, they may cast a provisional ballot that will be counted with no follow-up required by the voter provided their signature matches the one on file.\nSouth Carolina\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2010 election, Republican lawmakers in South Carolina passed a law requiring voters show photo ID at polling stations. The law was challenged in court and in 2012 it was amended to allow voters to show their voter registration card and sign an affidavit stating they have a “reasonable impediment” to obtaining photo ID.\nTennessee\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2010 election, Republican lawmakers in Tennessee passed one of the strictest voter ID laws in the nation, which allows handgun carry permits to be displayed to poll workers but not student IDs. If a voter does not have the required ID, they may cast a provisional ballot and then display appropriate ID at an election commission office within two days of the election.\nTexas\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2016 election, Texas passed a law that requires voters to present a government-issued ID card. Alternatively, in lieu of that ID, they may present documents from a limited list, including bank statements, utility bills, or a birth certificate and sign an affidavit stating that they were not able to acquire a government-issued ID for a narrow set of approved reasons. If the voter does not have any of the IDs on that list, she may cast a provisional ballot and provide the required documentation within six days of the election.\nVirginia\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2012 election, Republican lawmakers passed a law requiring voters show one of a pre-approved list of photo IDs at polling stations. After a legal challenge, the law was upheld by a federal appeals court in late 2016. Voters without approved photo ID may submit a provisional ballot at their polling station, but they must then acquire ID and submit a copy of it to a voter registration office by the Friday after the election for their vote to be counted.\nWest Virginia\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nIn 2016, Republican lawmakers passed a law requiring photo ID at polling stations. The law went into effect this year, but it is less strict than those in other states, allowing voters who do not have photo ID to cast a provisional ballot after signing an affidavit. If the voter’s signature matches the one on file, that vote will be counted. Alternately, voters without ID can have their identity confirmed at the polling station by an adult they’ve known for at least six months.\nWisconsin\nImposed More Restrictive Voter ID Laws\nAfter the 2010 election, Republican lawmakers passed a voter ID law that was signed by Gov. Scott Walker. The law was subsequently blocked by a federal district court until a few months before the 2016 election. Voters are now required to present one of a narrow list of approved photo IDs. The ACLU has sued Wisconsin over the law.\nEarly Voting\nVoter ID laws tend to get the most press coverage, but changes to early voting periods can also have a significant impact on turnout. Many voters aren’t able to make it to the polls on Election Day, particularly if they work in hourly wage jobs and can’t get time off to vote. In 2016, 47 million Americans voted early — an increase of 15 million just since 2012. Black voters in particular are statistically more likely to take advantage of these periods than white voters. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, seven states made cuts to their early voting periods since 2010.\nSince 2015, 13 states and D.C have passed automatic voter registration laws.\nIn 2011, for example, Florida shortened its early voting period from 14 to 8 days. The cuts led to long lines at polling stations during the 2012 election, with one study estimating that over 200,000 voters in the state didn’t vote because of those lines. After public outcry, Florida now allows its county election supervisors the discretion to expand early voting, although the total number of allowable days is still less than it was prior to 2011. In 2014, Ohio legislators cut the state’s six-day “golden week” early voting period, which had allowed voters to register and cast their ballot on the same day.\nOther states that have shortened their early voting periods since 2010 include Tennessee, Nebraska, Georgia, West Virginia, and North Carolina. In 2014, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin eliminated early voting on nights and weekends. A federal judge struck down this restriction, allowing the early voting periods to remain pending an appeal by the state that is presently being weighed by the U.S. Seventh Court of Appeals.\nVoting Rights for Formerly Incarcerated People\nThirty-four states have some form of restrictions on voting rights for people who have been convicted of felonies. Florida, Iowa, Virginia, and Kentucky currently impose lifetime voting bans on people convicted of a felony; those can only be discharged through a pardon issued by the state’s governor. These laws can be traced back to Jim Crow, and have had a disproportionate impact on Black voters in particular. Overall, Black Americans make up only 12 percent of the nation’s population, but 40 percent of those subject to felony disenfranchisement.\nBetween 2010 and 2012, Iowa, South Dakota, and Florida all enacted laws that made it harder for people convicted of felonies to regain their right to vote. But in recent years, the movement to give the vote back to people convicted of felonies has been picking up steam.\nFlorida – Floridians will have the chance this November to vote on Amendment 4, which would restore voting rights to 1.4 million state residents, including 500,000 Black Floridians. These are people with felony records, who have completed their sentences, parole and probation periods.\nDelaware – In 2013, Democratic lawmakers in Delaware passed a law that allowed most people convicted of felonies to vote after completing their sentence, including parole and probation periods.\nKentucky – In 2015, an executive order by the state’s Democratic governor restored voting rights for people who had been convicted of non-violent felonies. But just a few months later, his Republican successor rescinded the order.\nMaryland – In 2016, the Maryland General Assembly overrode a gubernatorial veto of a bill that restored voting rights to anyone who had been convicted of a felony but was not incarcerated. Now, people with felony convictions are permitted to vote after they are released from prison even if they are on probation or parole.\nLouisiana – Earlier this year, John Bel Edwards, Louisiana’s Republican governor, signed a bill that granted the right to vote to people who’d been convicted of felonies and have been out of prison for five years but are still on probation or parole.\nVirginia – In 2016, Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic governor, signed an executive order that restored voting rights to people who’d been convicted of felonies and completed their sentences, including parole and probation periods. There was strong partisan opposition by Republicans, and the Virginia Supreme Court ruled McAuliffe’s order unconstitutional. McAuliffe countered by personally restoring voting rights on an individual basis to over 150,000 people.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

In fact, since Independence, more than half of all presidents, vice presidents and members of Congress have come from a law background. Yet, in a recent working paper titled “The Declining Dominance of Lawyers in U.S. Federal Politics,” I show that lawyers’ once unquestioned supremacy in federal elected office is in a slow but steady retreat. In the mid-19th century, around 80 percent of the U.S. Congress were lawyers. By the 1960s, this number had dropped to about 60 percent. Today, just under 40 percent of the U.S. Congress are lawyers. The presidency has witnessed a similar pattern. While about 60 percent of all U.S. presidents since Independence have been lawyers, just four of the last 10 presidents have been lawyers.\nIn the mid-19th century, around 80 percent of the U.S. Congress were lawyers. Today, just under 40 percent are lawyers.\nLaw may still be the major occupational background for our national leaders, but in general, lawyers’ electoral fortunes are waning. This does not necessarily mean lawyers’ political power is declining overall. For example, lawyers may still have a disproportionate role in lobbying, policymaking and civil society or as thought leaders (see “Politics Outside of Office”). Charting lawyers’ changing prominence in these areas would require separate studies. Nonetheless, it is clear there is a decline in the proportion of lawyers in Congress—and this has potentially wide-ranging ramifications for a legal profession that has long viewed representing Americans in elected office as central to its identity.\nThe takeaway\nLawyers’ dominance in Congress is in a slow but steady decline. Lawyers are being replaced not by a diverse cross section of Americans but instead by people from a handful of other occupational backgrounds, particularly members of a professionalized political class who have served as legislative, executive and campaign aides. The decline of lawyers in the U.S. Congress, as well as in other segments of elected office, will undoubtedly impact the profession’s public and self-identity, which has long been intertwined with elected office and political leadership.\nHistorical perspective\nLawyers have historically been conspicuous in U.S. politics. Twenty-five of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence were lawyers. Fifty-three percent of the 1st Congress were trained in law. Although well represented in this early period, the number of lawyers in Congress was to grow strikingly. It is difficult to emphasize enough how pervasive lawyers were in the U.S. Congress throughout much of the 19th century and well into the first half of the 20th. During this period, anywhere from 60 percent to 80 percent were lawyers.\nIn 1890 approximately one out of every 265 lawyers in the country was a current member of Congress. Today the proportion of lawyers in the U.S. population is higher, but only about one out of every 6,000 lawyers is a current member of Congress. Both statistics are remarkable, but if one was a lawyer in the late 19th century, one was part of a select political elite. As Alexis de Tocqueville remarked in the early 19th century, the lawyer’s place in U.S. society was comparable to that of a political “aristocracy.” It is a position that lawyers have never fully given up.\nCongress is made up of four main occupational backgrounds: law, business, public service, and education. Those from a law background still dominate Congress—but not with nearly the stranglehold they did in the early part of the 20th century. Today lawyers represent less than 40 percent of Congress. In the place of law, new competing occupations have risen in prominence, such as business, medicine and a professionalized political class composed of political aides and members of civil society.\nMethodology\nThis article is based on a unique data set of members of Congress from Independence to the most recent Congress. The data for members of Congress from the 1st Congress (1789–1890) to the 71st Congress (1929–1930) was compiled by extracting occupational information from the biographies of Congress members maintained in the official biographical directory of the U.S. Congress. Data on the occupational background of Congress members from the 79th Congress (1945–1946) to the 114th Congress (2015–2016) was drawn from data compiled by CQ Press.\nThere are limitations with the available data. For example, all CQ Press data is missing some relevant data (for example, a small number of members might have no occupation listed). This is particularly true of the current 114th Congress, perhaps because this data is more recent, so it is supplemented with data from CQ Roll Call, along with official congressional biographies. The available data also does not demarcate how long one is in an occupation before entering Congress. For example, a member who served as a congressional aide for one year and one who served for 10 years would both be demarcated as a congressional aide. Although there are a number of limitations, the data sets used are more than robust enough to show general trends in how the occupational backgrounds of congressional members have changed over time.\nLawyers find success in Congress\nTo understand why lawyers have been losing ground in Congress, it is useful to examine why they have historically had such success in the first place. There is no single answer to this question, and a number of factors provide a partial explanation for lawyers’ historical dominance. Part of the answer might be self-selection. According to a 2002 Knowledge Networks survey, only 5 percent of the U.S. population have ever considered running for elected office. However, Jennifer Lawless, a professor at American University, using surveys conducted in 2001 and again in 2008, found that about 58 percent of lawyers have considered running. According to Lawless, lawyers are more likely than most Americans to report having attended a state legislative meeting, interacted with an elected official socially or as part of their job, or having an elected official as a family member or friend. Lawyers might think of running for office at a higher rate because of their frequent interactions with the political process.\n58 percent of lawyers have considered running for political office, according to surveys from 2001 and 2008.\nThere is also evidence that those who go into law have traditionally been more interested in politics in the first place. In a 1957 survey of state legislators in four states, professors Heinz Eulau and John D. Sprague found that legislators who were lawyers were significantly more likely to report that they became interested in politics in childhood than legislators who were not lawyers. Those who are interested in politics at an early age may be more likely to view a legal career as being both a historic gateway into politics and a practical platform from which to run. In other words, being a lawyer may make one more likely to go into politics, but an interest in politics may also make one more likely to become a lawyer.\nIn general, law is different from many occupations in which being a public official could be an obstacle to achieving further success in one’s field. Lawyers tend to have more-flexible careers that allow them to take time away from their practice or go between multiple jobs in their career. Having previously held an elected office can be a valuable prestige marker in the legal profession in a way that it may not be in other occupations, potentially being a gateway for later legal or quasi-legal positions in government or other areas of private practice or business. Indeed, holding elected office, particularly at the state level, where legislative roles have traditionally been part-time (see “Speaker’s Corner – Lawyers and Politics”), can help many lawyers further their legal careers by giving these lawyers expanded professional networks, a raised profile and the ability to attract more clients, either while they are holding office or afterward.\nLawyers in the U.S. also have a distinct advantage in electoral politics compared with other occupations: there are simply more public, and specifically more elected, offices available to them. The U.S. is exceptional among democracies in having elections in most of its states for many of its prosecutors, judges and state attorneys general. Lawyers monopolize these elected positions in the justice system, as well as appointed legal positions, providing them with more paths to higher office than those that are available to nonlawyers.\nThe presence of former state attorneys general in the U.S. Senate provides a useful illustration of how lawyers may benefit from this monopoly. Eight members of the 114th Congress, all in the Senate, were former state attorneys general. Besides governor, the state attorney general is arguably the most prominent statewide office one can hold in state politics and is often seen as a steppingstone to becoming governor. The position of state attorney general is exclusive to lawyers, is elected in 43 states and provides a platform with high political visibility upon which to campaign for further elected office. In the 114th Congress 51 percent of the Senate had a law background, compared with just 35 percent of the House of Representatives, continuing a long pattern of lawyers being more prevalent in the Senate than the House. Much of this discrepancy though can be explained by lawyers’ monopolization of state attorney general positions. If lawyers who had been state attorneys general were removed from the Senate and replaced with nonlawyers, then the Senate would be only 43 percent lawyers, much closer to the proportion of lawyers in the House.\nIn the 114th Congress 51 percent of the Senate had a law background, compared with just 35 percent of the House of Representatives.\nMore generally, prosecutorial positions, while not providing as prominent a position as state attorney general, arguably benefit lawyers’ electoral chances in a similar manner. Being a district attorney, U.S. attorney or other prosecutor can provide a track record of public service and a visible platform from which to run for further office. Not all these positions are elected, but many are, and, more generally, there is an accepted legal culture in the United States that being a prosecutor is a gateway for a larger political/electoral career.\nNot only have lawyers’ political fortunes benefited from the set of elected and unelected legal offices they monopolize, but the bar and court system has traditionally been deeply embedded in U.S. politics. Judges in the 19th century were well known for crafting, or creating, the common law in the absence of statutory law, and today judges are still central to resolving many of the largest political disputes in the country and crafting policy. As the academic James Gordon has argued, the practice of law in the U.S. has historically been “the adjustment, in a structured and peaceful fashion, of conflicts between individuals and interests. . . . The lawyer who saw himself as a facilitator of consensus in the face of conflict was drawn to the political arena because it was the battlefield upon which the most complicated and knotty issues in American life had to be resolved.” The politicization of the U.S. legal system is both deep and wide, providing elected and unelected positions exclusively to lawyers in a legal system that orients lawyers toward public life and resolving political disputes. It should not be surprising that lawyers have historically found such an environment fertile ground for a broader political career.\nMembers of the House who were lawyers received 55 percent more contributions from lawyers than nonlawyer members.\nBesides the politicization of the legal system, lawyers benefit from having access to more resources than most Americans. Some of these advantages are personal. Lawyers earn more than typical Americans, come from more-elite family backgrounds and frequently have flexibility in their careers to take significant time off to engage in politics. Other advantages relate to their connection to the broader profession. Lawyers can solicit campaign contributions from both other lawyers and their broader professional network, which can include the business community, wealthy individuals and unions. Members of the House who were lawyers received 55 percent more contributions from lawyers than nonlawyer members. Lawyers can leverage these advantages in campaign contributions, personal wealth and flexibility in their career for electoral benefit.\nFinally, part of the reason lawyers might so dominate Congress is because the public may perceive them to be better representatives than those from other occupations. Before the prevalence of legislative aides, representatives frequently had to craft and work on proposed laws themselves. Members of the public might reasonably have concluded that lawyers were technically better equipped for this task than others, and even today, particularly at the state and local levels, some voters might have a preference for representatives with legal skills. More generally, making arguments from evidence, appealing to juries, a command of procedure, and negotiating and mediating are all skills that lawyers may use in their professional life and arguably translate well onto a political stage.\nDespite widespread lampooning and degradation of lawyers by the public, people have traditionally viewed law as a high-prestige occupation and individual lawyers are often very well respected within their communities. Some voters may even perceive lawyers as having a desirable independence from business and other vested interests. As De Tocqueville noted, “In America there are no nobles or men of letters and the people is apt to mistrust the wealthy; lawyers consequently form the highest political class. . . .” In this view, lawyers are more like professor Anthony Kronman’s image of the “lawyer statesmen”—above the fray, providing wise counsel and worthy of a citizen’s trust and vote. Such a stylized view of lawyers’ position in the United States is almost certainly overly optimistic. However, while there are certainly stereotypes of ambulance-chasing lawyers, there are also well-cemented images of lawyers as advocates for civil rights and the disenfranchised, or as statesmen, that lawyer candidates may explicitly or more subtly invoke when they run for office.\nA slow decline\nLikely the largest reason for lawyers’ relative decline in the U.S. Congress is significant new competition in electoral politics. It might seem obvious that lawyers would face more challenges to their electoral dominance in an era when more Americans are educated than ever before. However, it is not a broad cross section of Americans that is dethroning lawyers. Rather, a handful of occupational groups are challenging lawyers’ dominance and in particular an ever-growing professionalized political class.\nA handful of occupational groups are challenging lawyers’ dominance and in particular an ever-growing professionalized political class.\nAfter World War II, the United States witnessed an increase in the number of positions for legislative, executive and campaign aides; the expansion of lobbying; the development of think tanks; and a greater professionalization of public interest work. In other words, a thick ecosystem of full-time jobs was created that revolved around the political process, particularly in Washington, D.C., and state capitols across the country. Lawyers occupied many of these new positions, but one did not have to be a lawyer to succeed in these new career paths. Indeed, most members of Congress from this professional background are not lawyers.\nThose in this professionalized political class have many, if not more, of the advantages of lawyers in charting a route to elected office. They have frequent interaction with elected officials, access to a politicized donor base through their professional work, an intimate knowledge of the political system and policy issues, and a career that both allows for flexibility to run for elected life and would likely be furthered by holding elected office. Indeed, many in this political class might even benefit from running for office and losing, gaining name recognition and connections they can leverage into other political-related jobs. This ecosystem of positions allows this professionalized political class to sustain itself both inside and outside elected office during the course of a larger career in and around politics.\nThe above graph shows the rise of those from a “public service/politics” background in Congress, with a particular spike from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s. The CQ Press data on which the above chart is based classifies “public service/politics” and “congressional aide” separately, even though “congressional aide” could be considered a subcategory of “public service/politics.” In the 114th Congress, 29 percent of members had either a congressional aide or a public service/politics background, making this combined grouping more prevalent than “business or banking.”\nThe number of people coming from a congressional aide background is actually underrepresented in the chart above. According to compiled CQ Press data, 8.5 percent of the 114th Congress, or 45 members, had the occupational background of congressional aide. However, supplementing this data with CQ Roll Call data and an independent search of Congress members’ biographical profiles, 81 members, or 15 percent, had once been a congressional aide. This discrepancy between the CQ Press and CQ Roll Call data may be because CQ Roll Call was more likely to demarcate that a member had been a congressional aide, no matter how long they had this position, while CQ Press may have been more likely to demarcate such a background only if a member was a congressional aide for a substantial part of their precongressional career. Meanwhile, in the 114th Congress there were 32 former campaign aides, 26 former state legislative aides, 12 former governor aides, 11 former White House aides, as well as aides for other local, state and federal officials.\nWhile the number of lawyers in Congress has declined since World War II, those from a business background have fared better, with their representation holding relatively steady, with a slight rise in the 1980s and early 1990s. In other words, as a professionalized political class has pushed out lawyers, this is not true of those from a business background, perhaps indicating that those in business have in fact become more competitive relative to lawyers. This may be because of the increasingly large amounts of money needed to successfully run for office.\nHealth professionals, particularly doctors, have increased their representation in Congress to more than 6 percent, a level not seen since the Early Republic period. The increase of doctors in Congress could be partially driven because of the expansion of health care as a part of the economy and its increased politicization. Most doctors in the current 114th Congress are Republican, and several have publicly expressed that one of their motivations to run for Congress was to repeal or amend the Affordable Care Act. Health professionals in Congress have among the highest median personal wealth of any occupational background and disproportionately used donations from other health professionals to fund their campaigns. Members of the House of Representatives from a medical background received 14.28 percent of their campaign contributions from health professionals in 2012. Meanwhile, health professionals gave just 5.14 percent of contributions to other successful congressional campaigns.\nMany top lawyers no longer required large public followings to bring in business and instead rely on relationships with corporations.\nChanges in the legal profession itself may be another cause for the decline in lawyers’ dominance in electoral politics. The initial increase of the presence of lawyers in electoral politics from Independence into the late 19th century may have been caused in part by the deprofessionalization of the bar in the decades after Independence as educational and training requirements were dramatically reduced in many states. After 1870 restrictions on entry into the profession began to increase, and law schools, and formal legal training, rose in prominence. As the gateway into law became more restricted, this may have reduced the number of lawyers in proportion to the educated population, and many of those interested in politics may have decided to forgo joining the bar to pursue another path.\nThe public face of lawyers also metamorphosed over the 19th century and into the 20th century. While in the 19th century, stories abounded of the public coming to courtrooms to listen to the oratorical skills of top lawyers and to be entertained by the cases of the day, by the end of the century, many of the elite lawyers moved from the courtroom to the boardroom, and the public seemingly turned to other entertainment options. Many top lawyers no longer required large public followings to bring in business and instead could rely on relationships with corporations or senior partners as corporate law firms began to spread across the country in the late 19th century. This evolution in the profession may have reduced the competitive advantage of many lawyers in the political arena.\nAs the 20th century continued and an increasingly large number of commercial lawyers started making more money, particularly starting in the 1970s and 1980s, talented lawyers may have had increased financial incentive to stay in private practice. One congressman recently noted in an opinion piece in Vox that since Congress provides “lower pay than [that received by] a first-year graduate of a top law school, Congress, like most federal agencies, is not attracting the best and the brightest in America.” At the same time, politics has become more of a full-time job, even at the state and local level, and lawyers may have to suspend their practice if elected to office. With increasing specialization and competition within law, it may simply have become more difficult for lawyers to take time off or return to practice after serving in office, lessening the appeal of spending time in an elected position. Norms have also seemingly shifted, within the bar and society, about judges going into elected office, seemingly creating a larger barrier for current or former judges to run for office.\nJust as the costs of running for office have increased for lawyers, some of the benefits may have also declined. For example, lawyers once ran for political office in part to advertise their legal practices, when there were restrictions on lawyer advertising. With these restrictions eased in recent decades, there may be less of a professional reason to run.\nEven among those lawyers who want to improve society, going into politics may have lost some of its attraction. The popularity of Congress, and politicians, is at an all-time low. Lawyers may simply believe Congress, and other elected offices, is not a viable avenue for social change or view politics as below their social status. A recent survey of Harvard Law School students by Shauna Shames, an assistant professor at Rutgers University, found that only 15 percent had seriously thought about running for office, compared with 19 percent of Harvard Kennedy School students (see “Running for—or from—Office?”). At the same time, many scholars and practitioners have lamented that the profession has become less public spirited and increasingly commercialized, losing its collectivist public spirit, perhaps leading to declining interest in politics.\nInternational comparisons\nThe United States is not alone among democracies in having a disproportionate share of its elected politicians be lawyers. Countries like Germany, the United Kingdom and France all have disproportionate representation of lawyers in their legislative bodies. In Canada, about 17 percent of the last Parliament were lawyers. It would be worth further study to determine what types of lawyers succeed in these countries and why.\nThe rise of a political class has also been documented in other countries. In the United Kingdom, journalist Peter Oborne has argued that elected officials there used to be steeped in Roman virtue and Christian morals but have been pushed out by a political class that he claims has effectively become a “plundering class” moving from being legislative aides to elected officials to lobbyists with little contact with the rest of society. In Australia, Trevor Cook, a researcher at the University of Sydney, has described the rise of a professional political class there, composed of union officials, political staffers, local government councilors and party officials. He also claims that high-status barristers in Australia have turned away from politics, which is increasingly seen as a low-status occupation.\nThis comparison suggests that larger shifts in the occupational backgrounds of politicians may be shared across some democracies. In particular, a professionalized political class may share certain features that enable it to be particularly successful in winning elected office wherever it finds a foothold.\nUnexplained Regional Differences of Lawyers in Congress\nOne of the great puzzles that came out of this research is the regional variation of lawyer-politicians as members of Congress. Historically, the South has been the most likely to elect lawyer members of Congress and the West the least likely. This pattern seems to have been established early in the history of the Republic. While in the 1st Congress there was no significant difference between lawyer representation from the North and South, by 1829–1830 the South and Midwest clearly elected more lawyer members of Congress than the Northeast. In 1889–1890, 87 percent of Congress members from the South were lawyers, while in the Midwest it was 78 percent, in the West 67 percent and in the Northeast 63 percent. Since World War II the South has generally elected more lawyers than other areas of the country (although in the most recent Congress, the Northeast elected more lawyers than the South).\nThe discrepancy among different states can be even more striking than among regions. For example, from 1945 to 2015, California had 414 representatives in Congress, of which 28.5 percent have been lawyers, while Alabama had 74 members of its congressional delegation during this time, of which 70 percent have been lawyers. These wide regional and state discrepancies may indicate very distinct legal or political cultures that impact the relationship of lawyers with politics.\nThese regional variations present a genuine mystery. One hypothesis could be that the South might elect more lawyers, despite being Republican leaning (at least recently), because it has a particularly politicized judicial system, with more permeability between judicial and political roles.\nWomen lawyers in Congress\nThe presence of so many lawyers in Congress may have historically slowed more proportional representation of women in the body. While in the 114th Congress 33 percent of Democrats were women, only 26.4 percent of Democrats who were lawyers were women. Similarly in 2015–2017, while 9.5 percent of Republicans in Congress were women, 7 percent of Republicans in Congress who were lawyers were women.\nThis lawyer gender gap was once much more pronounced. Of the 31 women who served in Congress before World War II, only two were lawyers, even though during this period lawyers constituted well over half of Congress members. This trend of disproportionately low representation of women lawyers continued after World War II, as the table below shows, although in the 93rd Congress of 1973–1974, women lawyers did make a temporary surge, achieving equality in proportion with lawyers in Congress more generally. This spike might be explained by the role women lawyers played in the women’s rights movement during this era.\nThe historically low proportion of women lawyers in Congress can partially, but only partially, be explained by the fact that many women members of Congress inherited their political career from their husbands—either taking over their husband’s congressional seat when he died or continuing their electoral campaign after his death, i.e., running a “sympathy” campaign. These women who succeed their husbands’ political careers were less likely to be lawyer.\nHowever, the death of politician husbands explains only part of the gender discrepancy. For example, of the 24 women in Congress in 1983–1985, five were women who were appointed or elected at least in part because of the death of their spouse. Still, this leaves 19 women, including three lawyers, whose success is not directly attributable to their husbands’ political careers. If this smaller sample is used, which excludes wives who succeeded their husbands, then 16 percent of these women in Congress in 1983–1985 were lawyers. In other words, even taking into account that some women follow their husbands’ footsteps in their political careers, the women who have been elected to Congress still are disproportionately less likely to be lawyers.\nInstead, a likely explanation for the disproportionately low number of women lawyer members of Congress is the challenges women have historically faced in the profession. While the first women were admitted to law school in 1869, the process of opening the doors of the legal profession to women was slow. The first woman graduated from Harvard Law School only in 1953, and until the 1970s, less than 10 percent of those enrolled in J.D. courses nationwide were women (see “Women as Lawyers and Leaders”). Since the early 1990s, graduating classes at law schools have been about evenly split between men and women, but women still face many obstacles in a legal career, and we may now only be seeing the number of women lawyers in Congress we would expect because past discrimination is slowly being overcome.\nThe lawyer-politician\nWhat should one make of all this? Lawyers’ close relationship with elected office has long shaped their public and self-identity. The slow but steady retreat of lawyers from higher office will likely, as a result, have a number of consequences: Talented and politically ambitious students may be less likely to attend law school and become a lawyer. A bar in which fewer lawyers go into elected office might have a less public-spirited notion of its duties toward society more generally, leading to an even greater fixation on law as a business instead of a profession. A legal profession that is more siloed away from electoral politics may also affect the larger judicial process.\nThe slow but steady retreat of lawyers from higher office will likely, as a result, have a number of consequences: Talented and politically ambitious students may be less likely to attend law school and become a lawyer.\nAt the same time, this decline may be viewed as potentially part of a larger transformation of the profession. While lawyers have long been known as quasi generalists who attain high positions of authority in numerous fields, they are facing new types of competition, and not only in politics (see “Lawyers Lacking Influence?“). For example, there has been a decline in the number of Fortune 500 CEOs who are lawyers, perhaps because of the rise of M.B.A. programs. In policymaking circles, lawyers must now vie with public policy school graduates and those with doctorates in economics and other social sciences, potentially diminishing their influence in this arena. In other words, while law may still be one of the most—if not the most—versatile degrees available, it now must compete with a variety of newer and frequently more specialized pathways to a range of careers.\nNick Robinson is a research fellow at the Center on the Legal Profession.\nThis article has been modified from the working paper “The Declining Dominance of Lawyers in U.S. Federal Politics,” available here.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        1848\nImage\n1866\nImage\n1872\nImage\n1884\nImage\n1887\nImage\n1888\n1892\nImage\n1894\n1895\n1896\nImage\n1900\n1916\nImage\n1920\nImage\nImage\n1922\nImage\nImage\n1923\nImage\nImage\n1924\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1925\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1928\nImage\n1930\n1932\nImage\n1933\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1938\nImage\nImage\n1948\nImage\n1949\nImage\nImage\n1952\nImage\n1955\nImage\n1962\nImage\n1963\nImage\n1964\nImage\n1965\nImage\n1966\nImage\n1967\nImage\n1968\nImage\n1969\n1971\nImage\n1972\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1973\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1974\nImage\nImage\n1975\nImage\n1976\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1977\nImage\n1978\nImage\n1979\nImage\n1980\nImage\nImage\n1981\nImage\n1983\nImage\n1984\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1985\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1986\nImage\n1987\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1988\nImage\n1989\nImage\nImage\n1990\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1992\nImage\nImage\nImage\n1993\nImage\n1994\nImage\n1995\nImage\nImage\n1997\nImage\nImage\n1998\nImage\nImage\n1999\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2001\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2002\nImage\nImage\n2003\nImage\nImage\n2005\nImage\n2007\nImage\nImage\n2008\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2009\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2011\nImage\n2012\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2013\nImage\n2014\nImage\nImage\n2015\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2016\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2017\nImage\nImage\n2018\nImage\nImage\nImage\n2019\n2020\nImage\nImage\n2021\nImage\nImage\n2022\nImage\nImage\n2024\nImage\nImage\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Donald Trump leaves the White House having appointed more than 200 judges to the federal bench, including nearly as many powerful federal appeals court judges in four years as Barack Obama appointed in eight.\nTrump, the nation’s 45th president, worked closely with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans to reshape the federal judiciary – particularly the appeals courts – for decades to come. Federal judges have lifetime tenure and typically remain on the bench long after the presidents who nominated them have left office.\nAs his administration comes to an end, here’s a look at how Trump compares with his recent predecessors in the overall number and demographic characteristics of the judges he appointed. All findings are based on a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education arm of the federal judiciary.\nFederal judicial appointments are an important part of a president’s legacy. As Donald Trump prepares to leave the White House, Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to find out how his record on judicial appointments compares with that of other recent presidents, going back to Jimmy Carter. The analysis is based on data published by the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education agency of the federal judicial branch.\nThe Center’s analysis focuses only on judges serving in the three main tiers of the federal court system: the Supreme Court, 13 appeals courts and 91 district courts governed by Article III of the U.S. Constitution. It excludes those appointed to certain specialized courts, such as the U.S. Court of International Trade, as well as appointees to non-Article III territorial courts in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands.\nWhite judges in this analysis include only those who identify as single-race non-Hispanic, as reported by the Federal Judicial Center. Non-White judges include those who identify as Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American or another race or ethnicity, as well as those who identify as multiracial or multiethnic.\nTrump stands out for the large number of federal appeals court judges he appointed in only four years. Not surprisingly, the overall number of judges appointed by Trump in his single term (226) is well below the totals of recent two-term presidents, including Obama (320), George W. Bush (322) and Bill Clinton (367). But when it comes to the nation’s 13 federal appeals courts – which have the final word on most legal appeals around the country – Trump’s influence is clear.\nTrump appointed 54 federal appellate judges in four years, one short of the 55 Obama appointed in twice as much time. In the process, Trump “flipped” the balance of several appeals courts from a majority of Democratic appointees to a majority of Republican appointees.\nTrump also had a major influence on the nation’s highest court. The three Supreme Court justices he appointed – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – are the most by any president since Ronald Reagan (who appointed four) and the most by any one-term president since Herbert Hoover (though Richard Nixon appointed four in his first four years in office).\nGorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett are all age 55 or younger. A Pew Research Center analysis in 2017 found that past justices who were appointed to the court when they were 55 or younger ended up serving for an average of nearly two decades.\nTrump was slightly more likely than other recent GOP presidents to appoint women to the federal judiciary, but less likely to do so than the last two Democratic presidents. Women account for around a quarter of Trump’s judicial appointees (24%). That’s a bit higher than the share of women judges appointed by Republicans George W. Bush (22%) and George H.W. Bush (19%), but below the proportion appointed by Democrats Obama (42%) and Clinton (28%).\nRepublican presidents have generally been less likely than Democrats to appoint women to the bench, but chief executives in both parties have increasingly done so. Trump’s appointment of Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2020 made her just the fifth woman ever to serve on the high court, after former justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg and current justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\nTrump appointed a smaller share of non-White federal judges than other recent presidents. About one-in-six of the judges appointed by Trump (16%) are Black, Hispanic, Asian or another race or ethnicity. That’s slightly below the proportion of non-White judges appointed by the last Republican president, George W. Bush (18%), and well below the share appointed by the last three Democratic presidents – Obama (36%), Clinton (25%) and Jimmy Carter (22%). As is the case with women judges, Democratic presidents have generally been more likely than their GOP counterparts to appoint racial or ethnic minorities to the bench.\nIt isn’t yet clear whether Democratic President-elect Joe Biden will need to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court during his tenure. Should a vacancy arise, Biden has vowed to appoint a Black woman. No Black woman has ever served on the Supreme Court.\nMore than a quarter of currently active federal judges are now Trump appointees. As of Jan. 13, there were 816 active judges serving across the three main tiers of the federal court system: the Supreme Court, 13 regional appeals courts and 91 district courts governed by Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Trump appointed 28% of those judges. That includes three of the nine sitting Supreme Court justices, 30% of the nation’s active appeals court judges and 27% of active district court judges. (The number of active federal judges changes regularly because of retirements, resignations, new appointments and other reasons.)\nObama appointed the largest share of currently active federal judges at 38%, while George W. Bush named 20% of the total. Clinton appointed 11% and George H.W. Bush and Reagan each appointed 2%. One active federal judge, Carmen Consuelo Cerezo of the District of Puerto Rico, was appointed by Carter.\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published on July 15, 2020.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The Mariners, the lone MLB franchise without a World Series appearance in its 49-year history, will also have to wait until next year after falling short in ALCS Game 7 versus Toronto, as will the Blue Jays, who fought until the bitter end of an incredible World Series but ultimately fell in the 11th inning of a winner-take-all Game 7.\nHere is a look at the longest active championship droughts, all of which go back to at least 1998.\nGuardians: 77 seasons (Last title in 1948)\nCleveland has had its chances during this time, but it lost World Series in 1954, ‘95, ‘97 and 2016 -- four of the club’s 12 postseason appearances since beating the Boston Braves in the 1948 Fall Classic. The franchise is 0-4 in potential championship clinchers over its past two trips to the Series, having squandered a 3-1 advantage in 2016 to a Cubs team that ended a rather notable drought of its own. It also has struggled with its back against the wall. The Guardians had an MLB-record streak of 11 straight elimination-game losses before beating the Tigers in Games 4 and 5 of the 2024 ALDS (Cleveland then lost to the Yankees in five games in the ALCS).\nBrewers/Pilots: 57 seasons (No titles)\nAfter one season in Seattle, the franchise moved to Milwaukee in 1970. It’s made just one Fall Classic, in '82, when the Brew Crew was unable to finish off a 3-2 lead against the Cardinals. Milwaukee has since made three National League Championship Series appearances.\nPadres: 57 seasons (No titles)\nAn expansion team in 1969, San Diego has yet to bring home a title. There were World Series chances in '84 and ‘98, but the Padres won just one Fall Classic game in those years against the Tigers and Yankees, respectively. The Padres made the playoffs in 2022 and upset the Mets and Dodgers to reach the NLCS. But their quest to give the city of San Diego its first World Series crown ended when the Phillies beat them in five games.\nMariners: 49 seasons (No titles)\nWith the Nationals making it to the Fall Classic in 2019, that left the Mariners as the only franchise without an appearance in baseball’s championship event. Seattle made it as far as the American League Championship Series in 1995, 2000, 2001 -- when it won 116 regular-season games -- and 2025. That most recent ALCS trip likely stings the most as the Mariners lost their first Game 7 in franchise history by a single run against the Blue Jays.\nPirates: 46 seasons (Last title in 1979)\nOnly six franchises have won more championships than Pittsburgh (five), but it’s been a rough road for the franchise since Barry Bonds’ departure following a heartbreaking loss in Game 7 of the 1992 NLCS. The Bucs’ only three postseason appearances since then (2013-15) all fell short of the NLCS.\nOrioles: 42 seasons (Last title in 1983)\nBaltimore’s most recent trip to the World Series was its victory over the Phillies in 1983, when Cal Ripken Jr. was a 23-year-old who was only a year and a half into his consecutive-games streak. Since then, the O’s have fallen in the ALCS in 1996, ‘97 and 2014.\nTigers: 41 seasons (Last title in 1984)\nDetroit’s last trip to the World Series came in 2012, when the Tigers were swept at the hands of the Giants. They’ve made it twice total since last winning in 1984. They also won the pennant in 2006, when they lost in five games to the 83-win Cardinals. In that span since the 1984 title, they’ve also found themselves on the precipice of the World Series three additional times -- losing the ALCS in 2013, 2011 and 1987.\nMets: 39 seasons (Last title in 1986)\nIt took a series of miracles for the Mets to come back in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series before eventually prevailing in Game 7. But the magic hasn’t been sufficient enough in the years since, although the Mets did enjoy plenty of memorable moments during their NL pennant runs in 2000 and ‘15. The franchise’s most recent Hall of Famer, Mike Piazza, was 18 years old when the Mets won it all in ‘86.\nAthletics: 36 seasons (Last title in 1989)\nThe A’s have enjoyed as many dynastic runs as any team outside the Yankees over the breadth of Major League history, but the last three decades have been a dry period for the franchise. Innovative roster strategies have kept the A’s competitive at times on small-market budgets, particularly during the club’s “Moneyball” period in the early 2000s, but the franchise has reached just two ALCS since last winning the World Series in 1989. The A’s most recent ALCS appearance resulted in a sweep by the Tigers in ‘06.\nReds: 35 seasons (Last title in 1990)\nThe 1970s were dominated by the Big Red Machine, but aside from Cincinnati’s most recent title in 1990, it’s been a different story since in the Queen City. The Braves swept the Reds in the ‘95 NLCS, and the franchise has not advanced past the LDS since then.\nTwins: 34 seasons (Last title in 1991)\nThe days of Jack Morris, Kirby Puckett and the \"Homer Hanky\" are growing further and further into the rearview mirror for the Twins. But the team has had its stars -- including Joe Mauer, Justin Morneau and Johan Santana -- who led Minnesota to six AL Central titles from 2002-10 before the club suffered early postseason exits. The Twins haven’t advanced past the LDS round since ‘02.\nRockies: 33 seasons (No titles)\nColorado had all the momentum in 2007, when \"Rocktober\" swept Denver and the team won eight straight postseason games and the NL pennant after prevailing over the Padres in a Game 163. But the Red Sox swept the Rockies that year in the franchise’s closest title attempt. Colorado has yet to capture an NL West division title.\nBlue Jays: 32 seasons (Last title in 1993)\nThe road to the World Series title ran through Toronto at the beginning of the 1990s, but dynastic days north of the border subsided at the turn of the millennium. The Blue Jays made their best run since their 1993 championship in 2025, but had their drought extended in heartbreaking fashion -- with a World Series Game 7 loss to the Dodgers in extra innings.\nRays: 28 seasons (No titles)\nTampa Bay debuted as the Devil Rays and began with some lean times, averaging 97 losses over its first 10 seasons. But the tide turned with a name change and new colors in 2008, when the franchise enjoyed a 31-win turnaround and claimed its first pennant before losing to the Phillies in five games in the World Series. The Rays pushed the Dodgers one game further in 2020 but still came up short in six games.\nAnd here are the 10 longest World Series title droughts in MLB history that are no longer active (going back to the inaugural World Series in 1903):\nCubs: 107 years (1909-2016)\nWhite Sox: 87 years (1918-2005)\nRed Sox: 85 years (1919-2004)\nPhillies: 77 years (1903-80)\nOrioles/Browns: 63 years (1903-66)\nRangers/Senators: 62 years (1961-2023)\nTwins/Senators: 62 years (1925-87)\nAstros: 55 years (1962-2017)\nGiants: 55 years (1955-2010)\nDodgers: 52 years (1903-55)\nNationals/Expos: 50 years (1969-2019)\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts\nThis article needs additional citations for verification. (August 2021) |\nThroughout the history of Major League Baseball (MLB), franchises have had various postseason and World Series droughts.\nAll 16 of the original major league franchises (i.e., those in place when the first World Series was played in 1903) have won the World Series, with the longest wait for a franchise's first championship being for the Phillies (77 seasons, ending in 1980). Since expansion began in 1961, five of the 14 expansion teams have never won the World Series. Furthermore, one franchise, the Cleveland Guardians, currently has a championship drought that pre-dates the expansion era. The three longest championship droughts in history were ended recently by the Red Sox (85 seasons, ending in 2004), the White Sox (87 seasons, ending in 2005), and the Cubs (107 seasons, ending in 2016).\nOnly one expansion franchise (the Seattle Mariners) has never won a pennant (i.e., the league championship, the two winners of which meet in the World Series). The three longest pennant droughts in history were recently ended by the Rangers (49 years, starting with the team's foundation and ending in 2010), the Cubs (70 years, ending in 2016), and the Nationals (50 years, starting with the team's foundation and ending in 2019, and including the franchise's entire 36 years as the Montreal Expos). As the Nationals are the third franchise to be based in the city of Washington, their 2019 pennant also ended a drought of 52 seasons played in Washington since their last pennant, which was in 1933 (discounting the 33 seasons during which there was no team in Washington).\nAs of the 2024 season, every active MLB franchise has qualified for the playoffs, especially since expansion of the playoffs in 1994 made that feat easier. The Angels have the longest active postseason drought at 11 years, while the Cincinnati Reds have the longest active postseason series-win drought at 29 years.[1] Long postseason droughts were ended recently by the Nationals (30 years, ending in 2012), the Pirates (20 years, ending in 2013), the Royals (28 years, ending in 2014), the Blue Jays (21 years, ending in 2015), and the Mariners (20 years, ending in 2022).\nThis list includes only the modern World Series between the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), not the various 19th-century championship series. Those teams which have never achieved a particular accomplishment in their franchise history are listed by the date they entered the leagues.\nPostseason droughts\n[edit]Longest current postseason droughts\n[edit]Longest postseason droughts in the expanded-postseason era\n[edit]After the postseason was expanded in 1995 to include eight teams (further expanded in 2012 to ten teams and again expanded in 2022 to 12 teams, including a 16-team postseason in 2020), 18 of the 30 teams qualified within the first five years, and few teams went for long droughts without at least participating in the first round of the postseason. This list only shows droughts of 15 or more seasons that occurred primarily in the expanded-postseason era.[2] Active droughts are listed in bold type.\n| Seasons | Team | Previous appearance | Next appearance |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 30 | Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals | 1981 | 2012 |\n| 28 | Kansas City Royals | 1985 | 2014 |\n| 25 | Milwaukee Brewers | 1982 | 2008 |\n| 21 | Toronto Blue Jays | 1993 | 2015 |\n| 20 | Pittsburgh Pirates | 1992 | 2013 |\n| 20 | Seattle Mariners | 2001 | 2022 |\n| 18 | Detroit Tigers | 1987 | 2006 |\n| 16 | Florida/Miami Marlins | 2003 | 2020 |\n| 15 | California/Anaheim Angels | 1986 | 2002 |\nLongest current postseason series win droughts\n[edit]League division champion droughts\n[edit]Longest current division champion droughts\n[edit]No league division champions were won in 1994 due to the players' strike that year.\n* Because of the wild card postseason berth, the franchise has won two World Series championships (1997, 2003) without winning the division.\nLongest division championship droughts through history\n[edit]List begins with 1969, the time divisional play started in Major League Baseball.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. The latest information on abortion policies in effect in each state—including total abortion bans and other restrictions—can be found on Guttmacher’s interactive abortion policy map.\nNumbers and Rates\nAn estimated 1,038,000 abortions were provided by clinicians in states without total bans in 2024, a less than 1% increase from 2023 and an increase of 12% from 2020.1 These numbers represent an undercount of the total number of abortions occurring in the United States, as they do not include abortion pills mailed by clinicians under the protection of shield laws to individuals residing in states with total abortion bans. They also do not include data on self-managed abortions, including abortion pills obtained from community support networks or websites.2\n- The abortion rate in 2024 was 15.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44. This is a decrease of 1% from 2023, when the abortion rate was 15.5, and an 7% increase from the 2020 rate.3\n- Current national and state abortion counts are available from Guttmacher’s Monthly Abortion Provision Study. US abortion incidence data for 1973–2020 are available from Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States, 1973–2020: National and State Trends by Age.\nProviders\n- In 2023, 765 brick-and-mortar clinics were providing abortion services in the United States, a 5% decline from 807 such clinics in 2020.4\n- As of March 2024, there were no clinics providing abortion care in the 14 states with total abortion bans in effect at that time. These states had 63 clinics in 2020.4\n- In the remaining 36 states (and the District of Columbia), where abortion was not completely banned, there were 21 more brick-and-mortar clinics operating in March 2024 than in 2020, a 3% increase.4\n- Online-only, or virtual, clinics have come to play an important role in abortion access. In 2024, they accounted for 14% of clinician-provided abortions in states without total bans, an increase from 10% in 2023. Nationally, the share of abortions provided via online-only clinics is almost certainly higher than this, as the 14% estimate does not include shield law provision into states with total abortion bans.5\nOut-of-State Travel\nAbortion bans and other restrictions imposed or enforced after Dobbs have led to a surge in people traveling from states where abortion is banned or heavily restricted to seek care in states where abortion is available.6\n- More than 169,000 US abortion patients traveled to other states to obtain care in 2023, representing 16% of all abortions provided in states without total bans. Half as many (81,000) did so in 2020.7\n- In 2024, approximately 155,000 people crossed state lines to access abortion care, representing 15% of all abortions provided in states without total bans.\n- The share of all abortion patients who traveled out of state for care increased from 9% in 2020 to 15% in 2024.7\nMedication Abortion\nMedication abortion accounted for 63% of all clinician-provided abortions in states without total bans in 2023; by contrast, this method accounted for 53% of abortions in 2020.8 At the state level, medication abortions accounted for the majority of abortions in nearly all US states without a total ban, ranging from 44% in Washington, DC and 46% in Ohio to 95% in Wyoming and 84% in Montana.9 These estimates do not include self-managed abortions or abortions occurring in states with total bans.\nCharacteristics of People Obtaining Abortions\nThe most recent data on the characteristics of people having clinician-provided abortions in the United States were collected in June 2021–July 2022 and represent the population of people obtaining abortions in the year prior to the Dobbs decision. The profile of people accessing abortion care may have changed since then.\n- Among people obtaining an abortion, more than two-thirds were in their 20s: 33% were aged 20–24 and 28% were 25–29.10\n- Adolescents made up 10% of people obtaining an abortion; 2% of people obtaining an abortion were 17 or younger.10\n- Similar proportions of people obtaining an abortion were Black (29%), Latinx (30%) or non-Hispanic White (30%). Four percent were Asian and 7% identified as another race or ethnicity or as more than one race.10\n- Approximately 55% of people who obtained an abortion had previously had at least one birth.10\n- Sixteen percent of people having abortions identified as nonheterosexual: 12% identified as bisexual, 2% as pansexual, 0.3% as lesbian and 2% as something else.11\n- More than 1% of people accessing abortion care reported their gender identity as something other than woman or female.11\n- Some 41% of people obtaining abortions had an income below the federal poverty level (FPL) and 30% had incomes between 100% and 199% of the FPL.10\n- Approximately one in four women are expected to have an abortion by age 45, given 2020 abortion rates.12\nAccording to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2022: 40% of abortions were obtained at six weeks’ gestation or earlier, 53% at 7–13 weeks’ gestation, and 7% at 14 weeks’ gestation or later.13\nInsurance Coverage and Payment\nMost individuals who obtained abortion care in 2021–2022 had some form of health insurance. But insurance does not necessarily cover abortion services, and even when it does, patients may not be able to use available coverage.\n- More than three-quarters (78%) of people accessing clinician-provided abortion care had health insurance: 45% had Medicaid coverage, 27% had private insurance and 6% were insured through the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges. Twenty-two percent did not have health insurance.10\n- More than half (53%) of people paid out of pocket for their abortion in 2021–2022.10\n- Medicaid was the second most common method of payment and was used by 30% of people obtaining abortions. Thirteen percent of people used private insurance to pay for abortion care, and 15% relied on financial assistance (such as donations from abortion funds) to pay for some or all of the cost of their care.10\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law, marking a significant overhaul of the U.S. health care system. Prior to the ACA, high rates of uninsurance were prevalent due to unaffordability and exclusions based on preexisting conditions. Additionally, some insured people faced extremely high out-of-pocket (OOP) costs and coverage limits. The ACA aimed to address these issues, though it did not eliminate all of them.\nThe ACA affects virtually all aspects of the health system, including insurers, providers, state governments, employers, taxpayers, and consumers. The law built on the existing health insurance system, making changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and employer-sponsored coverage. A fundamental change was the introduction of regulated health insurance exchange markets, or Marketplaces, which offer financial assistance for ACA-compliant coverage to those without traditional insurance sources. This chapter has a special focus on these Marketplaces that are integral to the ACA’s framework.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Health benefits & coverage\nWhat Marketplace health insurance plans cover\nAll plans offered in the Marketplace cover these 10 essential health benefits:\n- Ambulatory patient services (outpatient care you get without being admitted to a hospital)\n- Emergency services\n- Hospitalization (like surgery and overnight stays)\n- Pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care (both before and after birth)\n- Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment (this includes counseling and psychotherapy)\n- Prescription drugs\n- Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices (services and devices to help people with injuries, disabilities, or chronic conditions gain or recover mental and physical skills)\n- Laboratory services\n- Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management\n- Pediatric services, including oral and vision care (but adult dental and vision coverage aren’t essential health benefits)\nAdditional benefits\nPlans must also include the following benefits:\nEssential health benefits are minimum requirements for all Marketplace plans. Specific services covered in each broad benefit category can vary based on your state’s requirements. Plans may offer additional benefits, including:\n- Dental coverage\n- Medical management programs (for specific needs like weight management, back pain, and diabetes)\nWhen comparing plans, you’ll see exactly what each plan offers.\nMore answers\nGenerally, yes. But some states require insurers to cover additional services and procedures.

When you compare plans, you’ll see more detailed information about what’s covered. If you want to find out if a particular service is covered, call the plan.\nYes.

All Marketplace plans have\n,\n, and other\nthat apply to most covered services.\nSome\nare free, and some plans cover other services without out-of-pocket costs.\nIt depends. Large employers who \"self-insure” — meaning they pay employees' health care costs directly — don't have to provide essential health benefits. But many do. Check with your employer to find out if it’s self-insured and what services are covered.\nSometimes, and plans may have different restrictions. Some offer no coverage or coverage with restrictions. In some cases abortion services cannot be paid for with federal dollars (these are known as “non-Hyde” abortion services).\nContact each plan to learn about its abortion coverage.\nIt depends.

More Info\nQ. I am looking at a new job in Delaware. I live in New Jersey. Someone told me if I take a job in Delaware, I can claim the extra taxes that will be withheld by Delaware. Is this true? Can I have the Delaware employer just withhold New Jersey state tax?\nA. As a resident of New Jersey who works in Delaware, you would be required to file a non-resident return with Delaware (Form PIT-NON). You would be allowed a credit on your New Jersey return for taxes imposed by Delaware. Your employer would be required to withhold Delaware taxes as long as you work in Delaware.\nQ. I’m considering taking a job in Maryland. I know the states do not have a reciprocal agreement. How does the credit work for taxes paid to another state? Will I owe County taxes in MD?\nA. If you are a resident of Delaware who works in Maryland, you may take credit on line 27 of the Delaware return (Form PIT-RES) for taxes imposed by other states. You must attach a signed copy of your Maryland return in order to take this credit.\nEven though you may not be liable for Maryland County Taxes, Maryland imposes a “Special Non-resident tax” on their non-resident income tax return.\nQ. I’m planning to move to Delaware within the next year. I am retired. I am receiving a pension and also withdrawing income from a 401K. My spouse receives social security. What personal income taxes will I be required to pay as a resident of Delaware? I also would like information on real estate property taxes.\nA. As a resident of Delaware, the amount of your pension and 401K income that is taxable for federal purposes is also taxable in Delaware. However, person’s 60 years of age or older are entitled to a pension exclusion of up to $12,500 or the amount of the pension and eligible retirement income (whichever is less). Eligible retirement income includes dividends, interest, capital gains, net rental income from real property and qualified retirement plans (IRS Sec. 4974), such as IRA, 401 (K), and Keough plans, and government deferred compensation plans (IRS Sec. 457). The combined total of pension and eligible retirement income may not exceed $12,500 per person age 60 or over. If you are under age 60 and receiving a pension, the exclusion amount is limited to $2,000.\nSocial Security and Railroad Retirement benefits are not taxable in Delaware and should not be included in taxable income.\nAlso, Delaware has a graduated tax rate ranging from 2.2% to 5.55% for income under $60,000, and 6.60% for income of $60,000 or over. As a result, there is no reason to withhold more than 6.6% of all taxable distributions and taxable income to the State of Delaware.\nFor information regarding property taxes you may contact the Property Tax office for the county you plan to live in.\nProperty Tax – New Castle County (302) 323-2600\nProperty Tax – Kent County (302) 736-2077\nProperty Tax – Sussex County (302) 855-7760\nSenior citizens can contact the Department of Finance concerning property tax reductions.\nQ.

Are in-state municipal bonds taxable or tax-exempt to residents of your state? Are out-of-state municipal bonds taxable or tax-exempt to residents of your state? What is the maximum state income tax rate on out-of-state municipal bonds, and at what level of income does this rate apply?\nA. Delaware municipal bonds are tax-exempt to residents of Delaware. Municipal bonds from states other than Delaware are taxable to residents of Delaware.\nExample: Interest received on Pennsylvania Turnpike Bonds.\nDelaware does not have a specific income tax rate for municipal bonds. Income from out-of-state municipal bonds would be included in the federal adjusted gross income, which is carried over to the Delaware return.\nDelaware has a graduated tax rate ranging from 2.2% to 5.55% on income under $60,000. The maximum income tax rate is 6.60% on income of $60,000 or over.\nQ. My company moved its office from Delaware to Ohio last year. I had an employment contract and the company paid me according to this contract, although my employment was terminated this year. They have taken Delaware State income tax out of my payments for part of this year. I would like to know under these circumstances why they continue to take out Delaware state tax and what if any tax liability I have, considering I do not live in Delaware and have not worked in Delaware this year. If there is any tax liability, please provide me details of why and tell me how to calculate Schedule W, which clearly shows there is no apportioned Delaware income when no days are worked in Delaware for a non-resident.\nA. You must file a non-resident tax return (Form PIT-NON) to receive a refund of erroneously withheld Delaware income taxes if you did not live or work in the State of Delaware at any time during the taxable year.\nYou must attach to your Delaware return certification from your employer that:\nQ.

The following is the address as prepared:\nThank you.\nLieutenant Governor Davis, Speaker McClinton, President Pro Tem Ward...\nLeader Bradford, Leader Pittman, Leader Topper, and Leader Costa...\nThank you for convening this special session – and for giving me the honor of addressing this General Assembly for the third time as the 48th Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nI want to thank the Senators and Representatives gathered here and welcome our fellow Pennsylvanians who join us in this beautiful Chamber.\nI’m mindful that as we gather in this full chamber, one seat is empty this morning, that of the late Rep. Matt Gergley. We continue to lift up his family in prayer. May Matt’s memory be a blessing.\nBefore I begin, I want to recognize my outstanding cabinet and senior team, led by Dana Fritz, who I have the privilege of working alongside everyday to move our Commonwealth forward.\nLet's welcome our Attorney General Dave Sunday, our Auditor General Tim DeFoor, our Treasurer Stacy Garrity.\nAnd I especially want to welcome the love of my life and Pennsylvania’s First Lady, Lori. Thank you for all you do to lift up our fellow Pennsylvanians who aren’t powerful enough to have a seat in this room – but whose problems are our priorities.\nWhen this Joint Session was convened two years ago, I addressed you for the first time as Governor and for the first time in a dozen years, a Governor addressed a divided legislature.\nI told you then that we needed to work together – and if we did, we could do big things.\nOver the last 700 days since that Address, I’ve traveled all across the Commonwealth.\nI’ve gotten to see its splendor and meet with folks from all walks of life.\nI’ve stood with our fellow Pennsylvanians in times of triumph – and tragedy.\nRight now, in Northeast Philly, people are walking around in their Eagles green, excited about the Super Bowl...\nWhile at the same time, trying to process the horror of what happened on Cottman Ave on Friday night.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of that terrible plane crash – and we’re praying for a full and speedy recovery for those injured and battling right now.\nBut through that tragedy, we’ve seen what makes Pennsylvanians so special:\nOur resilience.\nAnd our willingness to band together to make it through tough times.\nNeighbor helping neighbor. Every level of government working together.\nWe can learn something from that example – and over the last two years, I think we have.\nBecause despite our disagreements, we worked together to get stuff done.\nWe solved problems that languished for decades.\nWe focused on common sense – and delivered real results to make a real difference in Pennsylvanians’ lives.\nI’m proud of that work – and you should be too.\nWhile there are still many challenges before us and many more problems to solve, we how have a real foundation to build upon.\nToday, I can report that Pennsylvania is on the rise.\n170,000 more Pennsylvanians are working today than when I began my term two years ago.\nWe’ve enrolled nearly 12,000 new apprentices – giving more young people the freedom to chart their own course and the opportunity to succeed.\nWe’ve attracted over 3 billion in private sector dollars and become the top state in the Northeast for regional economic competitiveness.\nPennsylvania is on the rise.\nOur seniors – like Bob Coleman from Perry County who joins us here today...\n…are staying in their homes because we gave Bob and 520,000 other seniors $320 million in tax cuts.\nOur families have $136 million back in their pockets because we made childcare more affordable.\nPennsylvania is on the rise.\nWe invested $11 billion in public education for the first time ever and targeted those dollars to the schools that need them most.\nWe’re starting to meet the needs of our students, including serving nearly 92 million free breakfasts to school kids last year.\nPennsylvania is on the rise.\nWe processed over 28 million permits in record time, eliminated backlogs, and cut wait lists for life-changing services.\nWe’re moving at the speed of business.\nWe’ve made wise investments that are beginning to pay off and we still have billions in surplus at a time when neighboring states are facing deficits.\nBridge repairs are up and violent crime is down.\nPennsylvania is on the rise.\nWe’ve done this work together.\nEach of the last two years both Democrats and Republicans have voted for commonsense budgets that solve real problems.\nWe’ve moved the ball down the field and put points on the board – and we should celebrate that.\nBut we should be hungry for more.\nSo today, let’s talk about what comes next and how we build upon the foundation we’ve laid.\nThis nation saw significant political change in the last election.\nJust two weeks ago, President Trump was sworn into office with the U.S. Senate and U.S. House under Republican control.\nBut despite all that change in DC, the voters here in Pennsylvania returned a Republican-controlled state Senate and a Democratic-controlled state House – with the exact same margins – to continue working with me to get stuff done.\nThe good people of Pennsylvania looked at all we’ve accomplished together and spoke loud and clear through their votes: Go do more of that.\nGo work together.\nGo solve problems.\nGo pass commonsense policies.\nGo build on that progress.\nAnd go get more... stuff done.\nPennsylvania is on the rise – and we’re not gonna stop.\nWe have the resources we need to make smart investments now and maintain a responsible balance in reserve.\nMy Administration has worked to cut costs and use our money more wisely.\nLast year, I directed the Budget Secretary to begin a comprehensive review of every program we offer in our Commonwealth.\nKnown as the REMAP Initiative, we started with three agencies and identified inefficiencies and costs that can be eliminated.\nThis budget incorporates those savings by sunsetting programs that are duplicative and don’t work.\nIn addition to savings from the REMAP Initiative, I directed the Secretary of the Department of General Services to conduct the first ever comprehensive review of every space the Commonwealth owns or leases.\nThe way we work has changed – we need more technology, more hoteling space, and more areas for collaboration.\nBy using the buildings we own as effectively as possible and reducing our reliance on external parking and office leases – we're going to save the Commonwealth tens of millions of dollars over the next several years.\nAnd when we save that money, it gives us a chance to invest it in the things that matter most – like great schools for our kids.\nOver the last two years, we haven’t shied away from hard conversations or solving complex problems.\nCase in point, how we reformed the way we fund public education.\nWe knew that was a problem and we agreed the old system was unconstitutional.\nSo last year, we made a commitment to not only invest a record amount of money in public education but create a brand-new formula that drives that money out to the schools that need it most.\nYou voted for that, I signed it into law, and we agreed to keep doing it until we meet our obligation set forth in Article 3, Section 14, which guarantees every Pennsylvanian access to a “thorough and efficient system of public education.”\nTwo weeks ago, I visited Harrison-Morton Middle School in the Allentown School District.\nThanks to the work we did together to both invest in our schools and drive those dollars but under the new adequacy formula, Allentown School District is receiving $90 million more than before.\nI saw the pride on those students’ faces when the band played their new instruments and showed me their new uniforms.\nI heard the comfort in their voices when they told me they now had more mental health resources in their school.\nAnd I listened to 8th grader Josh Colon-Hernandez talk about what a difference it makes to have a new H-VAC system that keeps school cool on those warm days.\nThose kinds of school infrastructure repairs are happening in more than 250 schools all across our Commonwealth.\nJosh also told me about how much he loves his teachers.\nAnd, because of our work, we've certified more new teachers than any other time in the past seven years.\nWe identified the teacher shortage issue as a looming crisis and we did something together to address it.\nWe created a new initiative to fund student teacher stipends to make sure those who are just getting started in this profession are paid for their hard work.\nI’m proud to welcome Melanie Williams here today.\nMelanie completed her student teaching at Centennial School District in Bucks County last fall.\nShe’s the sole provider for her family – and she was only able to student teach because of those stipends.\nWe’re putting more teachers in our classrooms and expanding the resources available to our students.\n778 schools have been able to expand mental health services and hire counselors because we prioritized student mental health.\nAnd, over 75,000 young people are charting their own course through vo-tech and CTE classes – that’s 3,500 more than before.\nBut there’s still work to do before we can say we’ve met our constitutional obligation.\nMy budget continues the path we set out on last year, by investing an additional $526 million through that adequacy formula.\nThat’s the exact same number we agreed to last year.\nThis budget also continues our support for school repairs, mental health, free breakfast, student teacher stipends, special education and more.\nWhat we’re doing for education is working – let’s continue to build on this foundation we’ve laid.\nEducation isn’t the only problem we’re solving together...\nWe knew it was a problem that shady middlemen could jack up the cost of prescription drugs while driving our community pharmacies out of business.\nSo we came together to pass landmark reforms that bring transparency to how pharmacy benefit managers operate, keep more money in Pennsylvanians’ pockets, and protect the small and independent pharmacies we rely on in our communities.\nBut that’s not all…\nWe knew that in neighboring states energy companies were developing groundbreaking new technologies, leaving Pennsylvania behind.\nSo you passed – and I signed – legislation that allows companies to invest in carbon capture and energy innovation.\nOn top of that, we stopped forcing our State Police to compete with PennDOT by decoupling that funding for the first time in over 50 years...\nNow with distinct and dedicated funding, we’re training 800 new state troopers, and fixed 12,000 miles of roadway and repaired more poor-condition bridges than any other state in the entire country!\nThese are just some examples of the many problems we solved together.\nWe should be proud not just of the laws we’ve passed, but the quality of the legislation and of the fact that we’re solving problems that have seemed so out of reach in this building for so long.\nLet’s solve more problems together, starting with regulating so-called skill games.\nBecause if we want Pennsylvania to compete and win, we need to take some of the money going into those slots and put it in our state coffers so we can maintain our reserves and keep building on our progress.\nThere are 70,000 unregulated skill game terminals in use across Pennsylvania.\nDistrict Attorneys across the Commonwealth are calling on us to regulate these machines and finally provide law enforcement with clear guidance.\nOn top of that, these machines have no quality control for the customers using them...\n...and, they’re punishing our seniors.\nEvery time somebody puts a buck into one of those unregulated machines, it undermines the Lottery and the critical services it funds for our seniors like prescriptions and meals.\nThe Pennsylvania Lottery lost an estimated $200 million over the last 5 years, primarily due to these unregulated skill games.\nOur seniors deserve better.\nSo my budget charges the Gaming Control Board – which already regulates other video gaming terminals – with regulating skill games.\nIn Pennsylvania, we’ll treat skill games just like any other video gaming terminal.\nAnd we’ll use the revenue from that to do two things:\nFirst, we’ll fill the funding gap for older adults that skill games caused in the first place.\nAnd second, we’ll provide an influx to the general fund to strengthen our Commonwealth and speed our rise.\nWe’ve been putting this off for too long. It’s time to regulate and tax skill games and protect the interests of our Commonwealth.\nLike skill games, there’s another issue that’s long overdue to regulate and tax – and that is adult-use cannabis.\n24 states have already legalized adult-use cannabis.\nThat includes almost every single one of our neighbors.\nI want to be real with you – as a father of four…\n…and as the former chief law enforcement officer of this Commonwealth, this one was hard for me.\nBut I took the time to study it and understand the impacts.\nTo understand the choice between continuing the black market of drug dealing versus a highly-regulated industry with protections in place for our children.\nLetting this business operate in the shadows doesn’t make sense.\nAnd by doing nothing, we’re making Pennsylvania less competitive.\nBesides, let’s not kid ourselves. Pennsylvanians who want to buy cannabis are just driving across the border to one of our neighbors.\nFive of our neighboring states have legalized adult-use cannabis.\nI've talked to the CEOs of the companies right across the border in New Jersey, Maryland, and New York who tell me that 60 percent of their customers in those shops are Pennsylvanians.\nWe’re losing out on revenue that’s going to other states instead of helping us here.\nWe’re losing out on an industry that, over the first five years, will bring in $1.3 billion in new revenue to our Commonwealth.\nI ask you to come together and send to my desk a bill that legalizes adult-use cannabis and expunges the records of people who have been convicted for nonviolent possession of small amounts of marijuana.\nA bill that sets reasonable regulations, protects public safety, and gives communities that suffered from the criminalization of cannabis an opportunity to succeed.\nI know some are going to say it's complicated, but it’s been talked about for years.\nAnd just in the last two years, Ohio legalized, Maryland legalized, and we keep falling further behind.\nI’ve been heartened by the fact that more and more Republicans and Democrats are coming on board, embracing liberty and economic opportunity.\nLet’s get it done.\nI know many of you care about making Pennsylvania more competitive.\nAnd thanks to the work we’ve done together over the past two years, we are competing again.\nWe're building new industrial sites that will host factories and labs and power plants.\nWe’re improving our Main Streets and supporting the small businesses that line them.\nWe developed a plan to revitalize downtown Pittsburgh and leveraged $60 million in state capital to generate $600 million in private sector investment for the Golden Triangle.\nAnd we’re reforming our government to finally move at the speed of business.\nWe took a hard look at our permitting, licensing, and certification processes and we slashed wait times, cleared backlogs, and fixed systems that hadn’t been looked at in years.\nNow it takes just 3 days to get a business license instead of 8 weeks.\nYou can get a new barber license the same day, instead of waiting 12.\nTime is money.\nAnd we’ve got a Permit Fast Track process for major economic development projects like Bellwether in South Philly and Project Hazelnut in Hazleton.\nWe now have a money back guarantee making sure permits get processed on time.\nAnd since that guarantee went into effect 15 months ago, we’ve only had to process 4 refunds out of millions of permits.\nLast year, you passed, and I signed into law, the SPEED Act to move projects more quickly through the environmental review process.\nFor years, people in this building have talked about permitting reform.\nWe’ve actually gotten it done.\nAnd the results speak for themselves.\nWe jumped 25 spots – more than any other state in the nation – going from one of the more burdensome states in terms of occupational licensing to one of the best, according to a trusted national index.\nAnd Site Selector Magazine named us the top state in the Northeast for economic competitiveness.\nWe are moving at the speed of business and inking major deals again.\nLast year, you all came together to deliver $1.1 billion in new funding for economic development.\nAnd as a result, we’ve secured more than $3 billion in new private sector investment during my time as Governor.\nThat’s a great ROI for the taxpayers.\nCompanies like Gecko Robotics in Pittsburgh and Martin’s Potato Rolls in Chambersburg are growing with our help.\nWe’re also attracting companies from all over the world to relocate here in Pennsylvania.\nFrom Il Pastaio, a world-renowned pasta maker that opened up their first American manufacturing facility in Union County...\n…to biotech companies like Adare Pharma Solutions who recently moved their headquarters from Jersey to Northeast Philly...\nBusinesses are choosing Pennsylvania again.\nAnd it’s not just businesses choosing Pennsylvania, it’s big events too.\nI’m proud of the fact that we landed the NFL draft in Pittsburgh.\nThis iconic event will bring hundreds of thousands of people to Western Pennsylvania and generate nearly $200 million in local economic impact.\nThat’s on top of the FIFA World Cup, the MLB All-Star Game, the PGA Championship, and more big events all across the Commonwealth.\nMy budget ensures those epic events have the resources they need.\nBecause all eyes will be on Pennsylvania as we celebrate America’s 250th birthday in 2026 and welcome millions to where it all began.\nEvery year, Pennsylvania welcomes nearly 200 million visitors as they enjoy their own Great American Getaway.\nThey come here for our sports and our history, our small towns, our restaurants, and our craft breweries.\nThey also come here to experience our Commonwealth’s natural beauty in a kayak, on horseback, by bike and, yes, even in an RV with their 4 kids!\nLast year, we worked together to invest in tourism – and it’s already paying off with more interest, more visitors, and more hotel rooms booked.\nSo this year, let’s build on that foundation by connecting more trails and creating more state parks.\nThis budget expands Lehigh Gorge State Park to include the popular Glen Onoko Falls trail – and creates Pennsylvania’s first underground state park at the incredible Laurel Caverns.\nBy the way, Laurel Caverns will be our 125th state park.\nPennsylvania is home to some of the most beautiful and remarkable places in the country and I want more people to experience them.\nThis is a budget that looks to the future – whether it's supporting America250 or expanding access to our parks and trails – all of which are free.\nAnd as we look to the future, we need to invest in the key sectors that are going to fuel our growth.\nThat’s why our Economic Development Strategy identified five pillars of opportunity:\nEnergy. Agriculture. Manufacturing. Robotics and technology. And, life sciences.\nThis budget supports all five sectors – but I want to focus on life sciences for just a moment.\nBecause this is an area where we are poised for explosive innovation and growth.\nIf you look at the landscape on life sciences, two regions have dominated for years: The Bay Area and Boston.\nIt pains me to even utter the word Boston given my hatred of the Celtics but facts are facts.\nAfter them, there’s a huge drop off – and a huge life sciences void that should be filled by us.\nThink about it: we’re already home to world-class universities and research institutions...\nPenn, Pitt, and Penn State all spend over $1 billion annually on groundbreaking research and development – and taken together our colleges and universities rank 4th in the nation in life sciences R&D spending.\nOver 100,000 Pennsylvanians work in this industry – at places like Krystal Biotech in Western Pennsylvania, Spark Therapeutics in Philly, and GSK in Lancaster County.\nThe foundation is there – we just need to connect the dots and create an ecosystem where innovators and entrepreneurs can thrive.\nThat’s why my budget delivers $65 million more in innovation and specifically designates $30 million for life sciences to help our industry leaders share data, commercialize their discoveries, and unleash Pennsylvania’s full potential.\nThis is desperately needed.\nIn the last five years, Pennsylvania companies received 10,783 new life sciences patents – that’s the 4th highest number in the country.\nBut we only received 3 percent of the venture capital flooding into life sciences.\nThat means we’re effectively doing the research but losing out on commercial opportunities to other states.\nLet's change that.\nBecause when life sciences grow and thrive, we not only improve lives but other major industries too.\nLet’s take B. Braun, a leading life sciences company in the Lehigh Valley.\nThey produce IV fluids, pharmacy products, and complex medical devices – and last year, they sourced $200 million in raw materials and equipment from over 100 Pennsylvania-based suppliers.\nThat includes raw materials from Exton, resins from Pittsburgh and moldings from Meadville.\nLife sciences feeds into every other sector of our economy and supports real growth.\nDid you know that the number one purchaser of eggs from Pennsylvania poultry farmers is a life sciences company?\nSanofi Pasteur purchases 200 million eggs from those farmers every year to power their work.\nSo much of our economic development is intertwined. Perhaps nothing as much as agriculture.\nThat’s why, for the first time ever, agriculture is at the center of our economic development strategy.\nAg isn’t just part of our rich heritage in Pennsylvania – it’s key to our future.\nThere are 50,000 farms across Pennsylvania that contribute $132 billion to our economy and support almost 600,000 jobs.\nTo ignore that isn’t just disrespectful – it doesn’t make sense economically!\n62 percent of those farms are less than 100 acres –Pennsylvania has more small and mid-sized farms than almost any other state in the country.\nSo when we talk about agriculture, we’re not just talking about big farms – we’re talking about our small businesses too!\nThere are few things more noble in life than working every day to feed our neighbors.\nWe have to support and invest in our farmers.\nThis body came together last year to create the first Ag Innovation Fund in the nation.\nYou seeded it with $10 million to start – and the response has been overwhelming.\nIn the first year, the Department of Agriculture received 159 applications for nearly $70 million worth of innovation projects.\nThe demand is there, so I’m coming back to you with a plan to more than double funding for Ag Innovation.\nAs we help our farmers embrace the latest technology, we also need to be there for them when disaster strikes.\nFor months, we’ve known that Hi-Path Avian Influenza was likely to return to our Commonwealth.\nWe’ve taken aggressive and proactive steps to communicate with our farmers – from our major commercial sites to our Amish community – and to encourage them to put biosecurity measures in place.\nWhile other states have been slow to react, we’ve been proactive – and it’s helped us avoid the worst so far.\nBut last week, we confirmed the first case of Hi-Path in a commercial flock this year in the Lehigh Valley and over the weekend a commercial flock was infected in Middletown in Dauphin County.\nThe Department of Agriculture is all-hands-on-deck right now, working to reduce the spread and protect our farmers.\nBut for those who are impacted, I want you to know that we are here for you.\nThanks to our proactive planning, we have the only Hi-Path recovery fund in the nation with more than $60 million set aside to support poultry farmers whose flocks have been impacted.\nWe are ready to deploy those existing resources as quickly as possible to assist farmers in need.\nWe will be there for our farmers – because our economic success runs right through our farmlands.\nEconomic success requires us to ensure a farmer, a life sciences company, or a small business can get their goods to market – and that the people who do the work can get to and from the job site.\nLast fall, I was standing next to a repaired bridge in Manheim Borough, in Lancaster County, listening to folks in that community express appreciation for PennDOT repairing their bridge over Rife Run and now they were able to get to work quicker and then get back home to their kids for dinner sooner.\nIn my first two years as Governor, we’ve delivered over $380 million in new funding for our roads and bridges and used it to repair more poor condition bridges than any other state in the entire country!\nOn top of that, we repaired 12,000 miles of roads – that’s more than any other time in the last decade.\nWe’re building out a transportation network that puts our tradespeople to work, strengthens our businesses, and improves quality of life.\nBut I’m mindful that for some, going to work and coming home in time for dinner doesn’t take you over a rural bridge like Rife Run.\nInstead it requires you to ride a bus, or hop on a trolley, a train, or the subway.\nAnd just like we repair and maintain the bridges in those rural and suburban communities, we also owe it to Pennsylvanians in Pittsburgh and Lancaster and yes, Philadelphia, who rely on mass transit.\nMy budget delivers to keep our mass transit running all across the Commonwealth.\nAnd while we’re at it, let’s deliver more funding for our roads and bridges, especially in our rural communities so we can continue that progress.\nIt shouldn’t be either/or, it should be both/and.\nWhether you’re a mom in Mantua, McKeesport, or Manheim, you deserve a transportation network that gets you to work and home again in time for dinner safely.\nBy investing in our roads, bridges, and public transit we not only help Pennsylvanians get where they need to go, we’re also attract business and grow our economy.\nBut if we really want to spur economic growth and help businesses grow here, one of the most important things we can do is make our tax system more competitive.\nIn my first two years, we’ve cut taxes significantly for businesses – lowering the Corporate Net Income Tax rate...\n...and increasing the net operating loss for small businesses, which allows them to write off more of their losses, so they have greater opportunity to get off the ground and be successful.\nSome were amazed that we were able to reach agreement to cut taxes so aggressively.\nAnd while I appreciate the accolades, I’m hungry for more.\nDuring my campaign, I heard from the Chamber and countless businesses across Pennsylvania who wanted to see faster cuts to Corporate Net Income Tax.\nAnd that’s exactly what this budget does.\nLet’s be more aggressive and speed up these tax cuts by two whole years so that we can compete more effectively and unleash our Commonwealth’s full potential.\nAnd while we speed up those cuts, let’s make our tax system simpler, more modern, and more streamlined to spur even more economic growth.\nLet me give you an example:\nUnlike most other businesses in Pennsylvania, banks and financial institutions pay one of three separate taxes instead of the Corporate Net Income Tax.\nOne of those bank taxes is so old, it was passed when Abraham Lincoln was President!\nLet’s eliminate those three outdated bank taxes and make our system simpler and more consistent.\nThis is commonsense stuff.\nAnd you know what else we can do to make our tax system more fair and more consistent?\nClose something called the Delaware Loophole.\nFollow me on this: of all the businesses in Pennsylvania, nearly 90 percent pay their full amount due in taxes – whether it’s the CNIT or the personal income tax.\nBut 11 percent of businesses – typically the ones who can afford bigtime accountants and high-priced lawyers – take advantage of a loophole in our system to avoid paying their fair share to our fellow Pennsylvanians.\nIt’s not fair that they get a free pass while everybody else pays.\nThink about it, they generate a lot of revenue in the Commonwealth, use our roads and bridges and schools and parks and then avoid paying taxes here due to an outdated loophole that 28 other states have closed.\nThat includes states like Texas and Utah; New York and West Virginia. States led by Democrats and states led by Republicans.\nSo let’s close the loophole, cut taxes more aggressively, move on from Civil War-era fiscal policy.\nIn my first two years in office, we’ve already cut taxes for businesses by more than $1.5 billion.\nTaken together with the progress we’ve made so far, my plan would cut taxes by $10-and-a-half billion by 2029!\nIt will encourage more companies to move here and expand here.\nIt will allow them to reinvest in our workers and expand their operations.\nFolks in this building have been talking about cutting taxes for years.\nBut here I am, a Democratic Governor with an aggressive plan to cut taxes, ready to work with you to get it done and make Pennsylvania more competitive.\nCutting taxes is important to strengthen our economy.\nBut no matter what sector you’re in, we’re a people-powered economy.\nAnd we’ve got to invest in the people doing the work.\nOne of the biggest problems we face in Pennsylvania is workforce shortages.\nThat's why I've been focused on expanding our workforce, from my very first day in office when I signed an executive order to make 92 percent of state government jobs open to Pennsylvanians without a college degree.\nSince then, nearly 60 percent of all new hires don’t have a college degree.\nTogether, we’ve invested in education to address workforce shortages and help businesses find the workers they need to grow our economy.\nThis budget builds on that foundation and places a special emphasis on workforce development.\nAnd I want to be clear – workforce is different than employment.\nThere are 170,000 more people working today than when I took office and our unemployment rate is near historic lows.\nWhat I’m talking about is the future of our workforce.\nWe need to ensure we have enough trained workers in the industries that will fuel our growth.\nWe face growing workforce shortages across several critical sectors, including childcare, direct care, and health care.\nThis isn’t unique to Pennsylvania. Other states are grappling with this problem too.\nBut we know how to solve problems here. So let’s get to work on it.\nIt starts by respecting all paths to success.\nSome Pennsylvanians join the workforce right out of high school.\nSome complete an apprenticeship.\nSome join the military.\nSome go to college.\nThere are many paths to success and we’ve got to respect – and support – all of them.\nThat’s what we’ve done over the past two years, increasing funding for vo-tech, career and technical education, and apprenticeships by nearly $65 million.\nToday, our Commonwealth invests 50 percent more in workforce development than the day I took office.\nAs a result, we’ve created over 110 new pre-apprenticeships and registered apprenticeships in just two years.\nAnd we’ve trained over 29,500 Pennsylvanians in fields like welding, manufacturing, transportation, and ag.\nAs I said, there are many paths to success – and last year, we came together to make the first significant progress on higher education in 30 years.\nWe directed significant resources towards our public universities and community colleges while at the same time expanding access to scholarships that make a college education more affordable.\nAnd we’ve finally started to fix the problem that I identified in my first budget address of universities competing against each other for limited dollars and ultimately driving up costs for students.\nWe created a coordinating council to ensure we’re all rowing in the same direction.\nAnd for the first time ever, we’re going to incentivize outcomes – paying our universities for their performance in meeting goals like graduating students with in-demand degrees and skills...\n...Graduating first generation college students...\n...Incentivizing universities when their graduates stay and work in Pennsylvania.\nNow we need to build on that foundation.\nMy budget keeps up the scholarships and grants we funded last year – and it fully funds that performance-based formula for Pitt, Penn State, and Temple.\nLet’s continue the work we started to create opportunity for Pennsylvanians.\nThere can be no wrong door for accessing opportunity and opportunity should be available to those with and without a degree.\nToday there are 650,000 Pennsylvania adults who don’t even have a high school degree.\nThat’s hundreds of thousands of our neighbors with untapped potential.\nFolks who want to advance their careers – but need help developing the reading, writing, and math skills most jobs require.\nThat’s where adult literacy initiatives come in.\nThey provide the training and education folks need to get a job, keep a job, and get a better job.\nWe have 54 centers across Pennsylvania that do this work, and more than 7,500 people are stuck on their waitlists because they don’t have enough funding.\nBut once folks get into a class, it can be life changing.\nThat’s the story of Alexandra McDowell – who joins us here today from Lancaster County.\nAlexandra took an adult literacy class and got her G-E-D, which allowed her to get a job as a home health aide – a field with critical workforce shortages – helping herself and our fellow Pennsylvanians.\nThese classes are the bridge to more people getting a G-E-D.\nThat’s why this investment of $6 million in adult literacy is so critical – it's a bridge to opportunity.\nTo grow our workforce, we need to believe in the potential of all people in Pennsylvania and not shut anyone out.\nSo, let’s open up the doors of opportunity for those 650,000 Pennsylvanians who want to learn so they can walk through.\nThere are so many Pennsylvanians who want to be part of our workforce – but too often get forgotten and left behind.\nOne of the greatest privileges Lori and I have had is meeting those with disabilities who are out working, powering our economy, and putting smiles on people’s faces –\nWhether it’s when we grab a coffee at Nour in Camp Hill, a sandwich at Bitty and Beau’s in Bethlehem, or a cookie at 260 Bridge Cafe in Phoenixville.\nThese folks might have physical or intellectual disabilities, but they are making incredibly valuable contributions in our communities every single day.\nWe recognize that.\nPeople often underestimate what people with disabilities are capable of.\nBut we’re different here in Pennsylvania.\nBecause we know that people with disabilities bring unique strengths to the work they do.\nWe have an entire office in the Department of Labor & Industry that helps folks with disabilities get in the workforce.\nIt’s called OVR – the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation.\nThis office doesn’t just give workers the skills they need – it actually fosters connections between the 50,000 Pennsylvanians who receive help from OVR and the businesses looking for trained workers.\nThis is something the First Lady herself has worked closely on with our teams at L&I, DCED, and the Office of Transformation and Opportunity.\nOne of the iconic Pennsylvania companies that has a history of hiring individuals with disabilities is Sheetz.\nThey’ve been working with OVR for a few years, hiring Pennsylvanians with disabilities to work in their distribution center.\nRecently the First Lady went to Wawa to encourage them to also partner with our OVR team, and they agreed.\nI know Sheetz and Wawa have always had a bit of a friendly rivalry.\nIn fact, I know many people in this room have picked a side.\nBut they’re unified behind lifting up and employing those with special needs and disabilities.\nI’m proud of both companies – and we’re going to keep reaching out to businesses all across Pennsylvania to encourage them to hire people who have so much to contribute to our workforce.\nI want to thank the First Lady for her leadership in this space and ask all of you to come together and fund the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation so that work can continue.\nOVR is just one part of our effort to expand our workforce and address the shortages we face in key areas – like childcare.\nToo many young parents are forced to exit the workforce because they can’t find affordable childcare.\nWe’ve taken action over the last two years to make childcare more affordable, expanding one tax credit for families and creating another for businesses who contribute to their employees’ childcare costs.\nBut we can’t just tackle affordability – we also have to increase the availability of childcare.\nRight now, we have 3,000 unfilled jobs in childcare.\nIf we filled those jobs, 25,000 more children in Pennsylvania could have access to childcare and parents could have the peace of mind that their kids are well taken care of so they can go to work.\nWe’ve all studied this issue – from community organizations, to chambers of commerce, to members of my Administration – and everyone reaches the same conclusion:\nThe reason why these jobs aren’t filled is because folks aren’t being offered a competitive wage.\nToday, we’re joined by Michelle Dallago, the director of a childcare center in Schuylkill County.\nAfter serving our nation in the U.S. Army, Michelle has dedicated her life to others – ensuring our kids get off to a great start.\nBut it’s hard for her to hire enough childcare workers, because we don’t pay them enough.\nSo this budget delivers $55 million to give childcare workers in Pennsylvania at least $1,000 in recruitment or retention bonuses.\nLook, we know this type of approach works to fill critically important positions – we’ve tried it with other jobs, including recruitment bonuses for municipal police officers.\nWe came together to pass that, and as a result we’ve been able to recruit nearly 700 new officers across Pennsylvania.\nLet’s build on that foundation and tackle this workforce shortage too.\nChildcare isn’t the only industry facing a shortage because wages are too low.\nThat’s also the case for our direct care workers.\nI’ve gotten to know so many of these good souls who go into people’s homes and provide care for those with disabilities and seniors.\nPeople like Cheryl Harp, who joins us in the chamber today.\nCheryl moved home to Harrisburg 10 years ago to care for Veronica, her aging mother.\nThanks to Cheryl, Veronica is able to stay in her home – cared for by someone who loves her deeply.\nListen, we’ve come together, Democrats and Republicans, to support those who care for the most vulnerable in our society.\nAfter years of shortchanging the ID/A community, we made an historic commitment to meet their needs in this past budget.\nAnd it’s working.\nFor the first time ever, more than 40,000 Pennsylvanians with intellectual disabilities or autism are getting the services they need.\nAnd after years of inaction, we’ve reduced the emergency waiting list by 20 percent since last July.\nLet’s continue to show we care for our neighbors this year by supporting participant-directed care and home care workers like Cheryl with increased wages, paid time off, and access to affordable health insurance.\nA sustainable home care workforce is also critical for our seniors, many of whom rely on their services.\nThat was one of the takeaways from Pennsylvania’s first ever Master Plan for older adults – Aging Our Way, PA.\nAnd it’s why, as part of that plan, the Department of Aging created a caregiver toolkit to give those caring for our seniors more help to do these difficult jobs.\nThere are 2.6 million Pennsylvanians over the age of 65, and the best way to meet their needs is to work closely with our community partners – including our Triple As.\nOne of the most critical areas our master plan identified was providing better support for our Triple As, which serve as community centers, connect older adults to critical resources, and serve on the front lines of protecting older adults from abuse and neglect.\nI’ve visited many of these Triple As, and I’ve seen how they’ve been underfunded for too long.\nThis year, we should make a significant new investment in our Triple As and support our seniors.\nWe have a special responsibility to look out for those seniors who served out nation.\nPennsylvania is home to over 800,000 veterans.\nI recently visited the Delaware Valley Veterans’ Home to thank them for their service to our nation and celebrate the holidays together. They’re wonderful people who deserve the best.\nAs we continue to build a new veterans’ home in Holidaysburg, I’ve directed my team to make housing for veterans a priority going forward and fund our veterans’ needs.\nWhether a Pennsylvanian lives in one of our 6 veterans’ homes, visits a Triple AAA, or goes to the doctor, they deserve great care.\nBut here in Pennsylvania, we are facing shortages of health care professionals – especially in our rural communities.\nConsider this: in urban counties in Pennsylvania, there is one primary care physician for every 222 residents.\nIn rural counties, there is one primary care physician for every 522 residents.\nThat means that rural Pennsylvanians – who already have to travel further distances to get to their doctor – also have less access.\nTo ensure every Pennsylvanian, no matter their zip code, has access to high-quality health care professionals, we’ve got to take action to build a more competitive health care workforce.\nAcross this budget, we take steps to fund more doctors and nurses where we need them most...\nAnd we expand an existing and successful loan forgiveness initiative to incentivize more health care providers and behavioral health specialists to take jobs all across Pennsylvania.\nThere are also commonsense steps we can take to ease these shortages that don’t come with a price tag.\nLike giving full practice authority to highly-educated, highly-qualified nurse practitioners who work under a licensed physician for at least three years.\nThis is smart – and it’s already passed.\nThe State Senate passed it last year on a bipartisan basis.\nPass it again, send it to the House, and let’s get it to my desk.\nWe need to address these workforce shortages for the future, and we need to make sure our workers today are being treated fairly.\nLet’s be real, folks.\nThe floor of our wage structure in Pennsylvania is too damn low.\nIt’s been stuck at $7.25/hour for the last 16 years.\nIn that time, every single one of our neighboring states has raised the minimum wage for their workers.\nMaryland and Delaware are at 15 bucks.\nNew York and New Jersey are over 15 bucks.\nOhio is at 10.70.\nWest Virginia is at 8.75.\nIn the last session, the House of Representatives passed legislation to increase our minimum wage to $15/hour.\nAnd the Senate sat on its hands.\nThat’s hurting workers.\nWe’ve spent so much time passing laws to put more money back in people’s pockets by cutting taxes.\nHow about we put more money in people’s pockets by raising their wages?\nLet’s raise the minimum wage to $15/hour.\nThis budget places a special emphasis on filling critical workforce gaps...\nIt makes strategic, commonsense investments to give every Pennsylvanian a shot at success...\nAnd it solves real problems – including problems in health care.\nOne of the most heartbreaking problems our grandmoms and grandpops face are neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, ALS, and Parkinson’s.\nThere are members of this body who have lost parents to these terrible diseases.\nAnd I know they want us to do more here to honor the memories of their loved ones.\nPennsylvania is home to some of the top research institutions in the world.\nLet’s put them to work by funding groundbreaking research into neurodegenerative diseases – and make Pennsylvania a leader in this fight.\nBy doing so, we would build on the progress we made last year when we created the first Alzheimer’s Disease Division at the Department of Aging.\nLet’s keep working on this together.\nTo ensure Pennsylvanians have the best possible care throughout their lives, we’ve got to address the significant structural challenges hospitals across the Commonwealth are facing right now.\nRural hospitals in particular have been stretched to the breaking point.\nThat’s why I convened a rural health care working group back in 2023.\nI’ve spent time working directly with hospital CEOs, health care providers, folks in this chamber, and many others to find a lasting, sustainable solution to this problem.\nBased on those conversations, my budget leverages $10 million from the Commonwealth to draw down an additional $26 million in federal matching funds to provide immediate relief to Pennsylvania hospitals.\nAnd recognizing the unique challenges facing our rural hospitals, it invests another $10 million in state funds to help meet their needs.\nBut I know there’s more we can do to support our hospitals and solve some of the big problems they face.\nSometimes, solving problems costs money.\nSometimes, it requires reform.\nFor example, when we came together last year to reform the way Pharmacy Benefit Managers operate.\nIt didn’t cost any money in the budget, but it saved taxpayers money on their prescriptions.\nWe shouldn’t stop there.\nLet's reform the way private equity has infected our health care system.\nLet me explain.\nPrivate equity is motivated to make a profit and make it quickly.\nThat doesn’t mean they’re doing something wrong or criminal.\nThey buy up hospitals and health care facilities, line their own pockets by stripping money and resources from those facilities, and compromising care.\nThen, in many cases, they skip town, leaving taxpayers holding the bag and communities without the care and services they need.\nI’m done letting private equity treat Pennsylvania hospitals like a piggybank they can empty out and smash on the floor.\nAs a Commonwealth, it’s time for us to stand up for our local hospitals and nursing facilities and put in place real safeguards against private equity.\nLet’s require pre-transaction notifications for all sales, mergers, acquisitions, and bankruptcy claims by empowering the Office of the Attorney General to review these intentions carefully, comprehensively, and with the community’s best interest at the forefront.\nLet’s also put an end to harmful leaseback arrangements – where a private equity-backed hospital or nursing home sells their land and then rents it back, often at excessively high prices that push them deeper into debt.\nMany of you in this chamber have seen the damage private equity can do to local health care facilities.\nIn fact, Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate have sponsored bills to make these needed reforms.\nPass the bills, put them on my desk, and stop letting private equity take advantage of our health care system.\nHere’s something in the health care space that we don’t often talk about...\nAn issue that lurks in the shadows, but affects 1 in 8 moms across our country...\nPostpartum depression.\nImproving maternal health is important to me – and I know it’s important to so many of you in this chamber, on both sides of the aisle – including the Black Maternal Health Caucus.\nTwo years ago, we came together to make the first-ever state investment to address maternal mortality – and we doubled down last year.\nBut when it comes to postpartum depression, moms in need aren’t getting the help they deserve.\nSo I’m directing the Department of Health to work with health care providers across Pennsylvania to implement universal postpartum screenings for moms...\nTrain doctors, nurses, and health care professionals on how to more quickly identify postpartum depression...\nSpeed up referrals to mental health professionals when a mom is diagnosed...\nAnd create a resource hub where families can go to find more information – as well as local support networks – for postpartum depression.\nLet’s take an issue that lurks in the shadows and put it right in the middle of the conversation.\nLet’s end the stigma around postpartum depression just like we’ve worked to end the stigma around mental health.\nOver the past two years, we’ve made a commitment to treat mental health just as seriously as physical health here in Pennsylvania.\nWe’ve taken aggressive action to deliver mental health parity.\nIn fact, our review process for parity, led by the Insurance Department, now serves as a national model.\nBut we can’t stop there.\nThere are still reforms that need to be made.\nWe’ve come together to deliver $200 million that schools can use to increase mental health supports for our students.\nIt’s working, but we’ve found a glaring loophole.\nWhile an insurance company would normally cover mental health services for students, they often don’t if those services are delivered inside the walls of a school.\nThat makes no sense.\nIf the same student saw the same mental health professional and received the same services in an office across the street, the insurance company would reimburse for it.\nLet’s close this loophole that insurance companies are taking advantage of and pass a law to stop insurance companies from denying payment for mental health services simply because they are provided in a school.\nAnd while we’re fixing mental health coverage for kids, here’s another thing we should work on:\nLet’s have transparency in pricing in health care.\nLook, if you make any other purchase – from groceries to buying the refrigerator you store them in – you can look up the price ahead of time and see what the store is going to charge.\nYou can shop around and make the right choice for your family based on quality and price.\nYou should be able to pick your doctor based on quality and price, too.\nAs individuals, we can go to our insurance provider and ask: How much will I have to pay to get my child the inhaler he was prescribed?\nBut we can’t compare that to what other insurance providers would charge.\nPennsylvanians deserve price transparency in their health care system.\nSo this budget invests $4 million in P-H-C4 to develop an All-Payer Claims Database.\nThe database will collect medical, pharmacy, and dental claims from private and public insurers and make them publicly available.\nThat small investment of $4 million will allow Pennsylvanians to save hundreds of millions of dollars on their medical bills.\nThis is a commonsense step to cut health care costs.\nLet's also enshrine the protections of the Affordable Care Act under federal law into our state law in Pennsylvania.\nToday, 1.2 million Pennsylvanians get their health care through the Affordable Care Act.\nAnd while I know there are some who would like to do away with it in Washington DC....\nThe fact is it’s working for Pennsylvanians.\nPennsylvanians have come to rely on guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions...\nThe guarantee that young adults can stay on their parents’ insurance until they turn 26...\nAnd the guarantee that lifetime limits won’t price people out of the health care they need and deserve.\nIf we fail to do so and the ACA goes away, health care costs will dramatically increase for Pennsylvanians.\nLet’s make sure that doesn’t happen.\nFrom childcare to health care to energy, we’ve been focused on cutting costs across the board.\nOur Commonwealth is the second largest energy exporter in the country – and one of the most important energy producers in the world.\nBecause of that, we are powerful enough to develop commonsense policy that will lower costs, protect and create jobs, and take meaningful action to address climate change.\nLast week, I announced my vision to secure our Commonwealth’s energy future – the Lightning Plan.\nInspired by Ben Franklin, and backed by environmental groups, the building trades, chambers of commerce, consumer organizations, and even industry leaders, the Lightning Plan takes bold steps to increase energy production, explore pathways to renewable sources, and grow our economy.\nIt takes concrete, direct steps to cut energy costs, create jobs, hold down electric bills for families, and increase generation in our Commonwealth.\nThe time for action is now – so when folks turn on the light switch in their homes they won’t have to worry whether the power will turn on or if the bill will be too high.\nHere’s another thing people shouldn’t have to worry about: access to safe, affordable housing.\nIn April, my Administration will certify over $1 billion in property tax relief through the homestead and farmstead exclusion.\nIt’s the first time ever there will be over $1 billion available for property tax relief.\nThe day I took office, the average homeowner received savings of $225.\nAs a result of this certification, those average savings will climb to $386 per household.\nWe’re cutting costs for Pennsylvanians, but we need to do more.\nIn Indiana County, over the last five years, rent has increased 26%.\nIn Philadelphia County it’s increased by 30%.\nTwo very different counties with the exact same problem that’s mostly been driven by a severe lack of new development across Pennsylvania.\nTo meet the need for housing this year alone, we need more than 100,000 new homes and apartments.\nLast September, I signed an Executive Order to create Pennsylvania’s first ever Housing Action Plan and we’ve been busy at work.\nWhile the final housing plan will be coming in the next few months, we've identified six key steps we can take immediately to begin to solve this problem.\nFirst, let’s invest $10 million to help first-time home buyers cover closing costs – so not only can they put a roof over their head, but they’ll have a real chance to build generational wealth.\nSecond, let’s staff up the State Planning Board, so it can help local communities fix their permitting, zoning, and code enforcement issues and build more homes more quickly.\nwe’ve improved permitting at the state level, let’s help our local partners do the same.\nThird, let’s create an Interagency Council on Homelessness to improve support and coordination for the unhoused.\nFourth, let’s continue the progress we made last year by increasing our largest and most flexible affordable housing tool – PHARE – by an additional $10 million to reach $110 million by the end of 2028.\nIn the last 2 years, PHARE has been used for construction on 2,000 new homes and apartments and repairs to another 3,200 – protecting folks' homes and keeping them affordable.\nFifth, let’s seal eviction records if you weren’t actually evicted.\nBecause in Pennsylvania, as soon as an eviction is filed, it becomes a permanent mark on someone’s background, even if that case eventually gets ruled in the tenant’s favor.\nThat makes no sense. Let’s deploy our commonsense mentality and fix this together by sealing those cases from public records.\nAnd, sixth, let’s invest $50 million to create a new statewide housing repair fund to help homeowners struggling to make needed repairs to their aging homes.\nConsider this: almost 60 percent of the homes in Pennsylvania were built before 1970.\nMany of them are in dire need of repairs but a lot of homeowners like Thomasine Frank from Lawrence County just can’t afford it.\nThomasine, who’s with us today, has been on the waitlist for home repair funding for two years now.\nShe’s dealing with a leaky roof and a back door that doesn’t close right.\nWe can help her. We can solve this problem.\nI know you see these needs in your communities.\nMany of you have attended my Administration’s roundtables.\nYou have heard from your constituents.\nIt’s time we deliver for them.\nBy taking these commonsense steps, we can cut housing costs and help more Pennsylvanians pursue the American Dream.\nWe’re cutting costs for Pennsylvanians.\nWe’re making sure they can receive the health care they need.\nWe're expanding our workforce, investing in our schools and growing our economy.\nWorking together, we are solving real problems.\nSo let’s solve another by prioritizing the needs of our brave firefighters.\nLet me give you an example:\nThe Wilkes-Barre Fire Department responds to 10,000 calls every year – but they’re using a fire engine that’s more than 30 years old.\nThat’s not because they want to – it’s because they haven’t been able to secure the funding to buy a new one.\nWe’re joined today by Wilkes-Barre Fire Department Assistant Chief Travis Temarantz and Captain Rich Matchey.\nThese guys and their teams literally run into burning buildings to keep us safe.\nWe need to do right by them.\nMy budget takes three concrete steps to support our fire fighters.\nFirst, it creates a new, competitive funding stream of $30 million in grants for our fire companies.\nWe already appropriate $30 million through a different initiative, and that money gets spread out across all our fire companies.\nFirefighters know they’ll get a steady stream of funding every year – and that’s a good foundation.\nBut the current system makes it hard for companies like Wilkes-Barre to make a single big purchase or equipment upgrade.\nThis budget solves that problem by establishing competitive grants that allow fire companies to purchase equipment, recruit and retain firefighters, and meet their unique needs.\nSecond, we have to be mindful that firefighters are being stretched thin right now, responding to more and more calls each year as the number of firefighters across the Commonwealth shrinks.\nFire companies have told me they want to collaborate more and share services more.\nBut there’s no incentive for them to do it, because it costs them money. My budget incentivizes cooperation and creates a pilot program to help municipal fire companies work together.\nJust like our law enforcement officers and first responders, our firefighters do a dangerous job and they deserve our support.\nThird, let’s cover cancer screenings for firefighters every year.\nLast year, we reformed our Workers’ Compensation Act to ensure firefighters, first responders, and law enforcement with a post-traumatic stress injury get the coverage they deserve.\nLet’s build on that foundation.\nFirefighters expose themselves to toxic chemicals while on the job – all to keep us safe.\nWe need to have their backs.\nWhen that plane crashed in Northeast Philly last week, we saw our brave firefighters put out a raging jet fuel fire.\nAnd because of how quickly they acted, lives were saved.\nThey did that work in partnership with law enforcement.\nLaw enforcement at all levels worked together to help a frightened community.\nWe have to keep investing in our police – especially our State Police, the finest law enforcement organization in the country.\nThey take seriously their responsibility to be there for Pennsylvanians, from Northeast Philly to the Northern Tier...\nBut in turn, it’s our responsibility to provide them with the resources they need to be successful.\nThat’s why we took an historic step, to give PSP dedicated funding and we have to continue that commitment in this budget.\nWe’ve also funded new cadet classes to offset the increasing number of Troopers nearing retirement.\nToday, nearly 400 more highly-trained Troopers are out in our communities thanks to that bipartisan commitment – and more are on their way.\nTo build on that foundation, this budget adds 4 more cadet classes for the Pennsylvania State Police.\nThis budget also supports our Corrections Officers, reducing the strain on them and giving them the resources they need to do their critically important jobs successfully.\nMy Administration has prioritized filling critical vacancies among our Corrections Officers.\nOver the last two years, we’ve cut the corrections officer vacancy rate in half, hiring nearly 3,000 new C-Os.\nOur investments in law enforcement are working.\nViolent crime is down across much of Pennsylvania.\nAnd we understand that investing in law enforcement is one part of that success.\nThe other part is working with community groups, youth groups, and church groups to lift up their work.\nWe created the BOOST initiative to help expand afterschool programs so kids have somewhere safe and productive to go before their parents get off work.\nFour dozen afterschool programs are expanding because of our collective work, giving thousands of kids more opportunities to succeed and less opportunities to engage in violence.\nThat’s a good start, and this budget builds on that foundation so we can expand our impact and make our communities safer.\nI want to give special thanks to Lieutenant Governor Davis, the Chairman of PCCD, for connecting the dots between our state funding and the organizations on the ground who are doing meaningful work to reduce violence in our communities.\nSo here’s what I want us to do together:\nEnsure we have good schools for our kids in every zip code.\nGrow our economy and cut costs for people in rural, urban, and suburban communities.\nSlash taxes to spur economic growth.\nMake health care and energy accessible and affordable for all Pennsylvanians.\nEnsure our kids can walk down the street safely.\nStop giving our neighboring states a competitive advantage.\nThese are commonsense Pennsylvania priorities that I know we all share.\nI recognize some may have a different approach to these objectives, but we’ve got to work at it together.\nLook, I get how politics works.\nI know there are some folks in this room who will feel the need to just be reflexively against whatever I’m for.\nRemember, despite the wave nationally, voters sent the same group back here to keep making progress.\nAnd so I ask you to resist the temptation to put politics above people – and instead let’s continue to work together to solve more problems.\nTwo days ago, I was standing with nearly 50,000 people in a cold field in Punxsutawney at 6 o’clock in the morning as the sun rose over the horizon.\nFolks from every corner of the Commonwealth...\nIn fact, from all corners of this great country and several foreign countries...\nGathered together to see our official state meteorologist, Phil, come out and give us a glimpse into our collective future.\nAt that moment, as we held our breath while the President of the Inner Circle, Tom “Shingle Shaker” Dunkel, waited to see if Phil would see his shadow.\nTom and his wife join us here today.\nWe were all just there together, in shared humanity and good spirits, excited to be part of this tradition.\nI know some folks think we’re all crazy for standing in the freezing cold waiting for Phil.\nBut I gotta tell you, I love Groundhog Day.\nI go every year.\nAnd the greatest part is seeing tens of thousands of joyful people come together from all walks of life.\nPennsylvania is built on traditions that bring us together.\nTraditions that both celebrate our shared past – and also welcome newcomers to join and share in the fun.\nThat’s the spirit of Pennsylvania.\nAnd it started when William Penn first founded our home as a place where all would be welcome.\nEach successive generation has passed down those traditions, and through it all we’ve made sure that Pennsylvania would be a place where everyone belongs.\nNo matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you pray to.\nA place where you could be comfortable being yourself.\nA place where we continually forge ahead – never losing the traditions that bind us together, but always creating new pathways of opportunity for all.\nThe first Groundhog Day was held in 1887.\nAnd since then, Pennsylvania has stayed true to those values.\nOur Commonwealth fueled the industrial revolution – lifting people out of poverty, powering the middle class, and creating the American labor movement.\nPennsylvania workers in energy and steel gave rise to the arsenal of democracy and the most powerful manufacturing base in the world.\nOur scientists created medical miracles and life-saving remedies – including the vaccine that drove back the scourge of polio.\nWe built the first modern interstate, linking Beaver County to Bensalem.\nFrom art to music to sports – great Pennsylvanians like Teenie Harris, Andy Warhol, Franco Harris, and Taylor Swift have inspired the world.\nAnd along the way, when the world needed some changing, Pennsylvanians like James Forten, Cecil B. Moore, and Rachel Carson triumphed through the tumult.\nBut through it all, our legacy has been defined by everyday folks rising up, demanding more, seeking change, and keeping us on that path towards progress.\nI’m inspired by those people.\nWe owe it to them to tackle the challenges we face today with that same spirit: with principled common sense and a respect for all.\nBy staying true to our values, I know we can work together to get more stuff done.\nAnd of course... by honoring our traditions... including the tradition of getting our weather from a groundhog.\nI’m proud as hell to be your Governor – to take up that baton of progress passed down through the generations and run forward into a future filled with more opportunity for all.\nLadies and gentleman, Pennsylvania is on the rise.\nLet’s keep reaching for that horizon, together.\nMay God bless you and our fellow Pennsylvanians.\nAnd may God watch over the men and women of the Pennsylvania National Guard – and all those who wear the uniform.\nThank you.\n# # #\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Childhood obesity increases the risk for adult obesity and is associated with negative health consequences. Trends in the state-specific prevalence of obesity among low-income U.S. preschool children have not been examined since 2008. State-specific obesity prevalence surveillance helps determine the need for and impact of state and local obesity prevention strategies.\nMethods: Measured weight and height data from approximately 11.6 million low-income children aged 2–4 years from 40 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories who participated in the Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System during 2008–2011 were used to estimate state obesity prevalence. Obesity was defined as having an age- and sex-specific body mass index ≥95th percentile, according to the 2000 CDC growth charts. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity were used to examine trends in the state-specific obesity prevalence.\nResults: During 2008–2011, statistically significant downward trends in obesity prevalence were observed in 18 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, South Dakota, and the U.S. Virgin Islands had the largest absolute decreases in obesity prevalence, each with a decrease of ≥1 percentage point. Twenty states and Puerto Rico experienced no significant change, and obesity prevalence increased significantly in three states.\nConclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Small but significant declines in obesity among low-income preschoolers were observed in 19 of 43 states/territories examined. Continued prevention efforts are needed to sustain and expand the implementation and evaluation of population-level interventions to prevent childhood obesity.\nIntroduction\nData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that nationally the prevalence of obesity remains high among all youths, including preschool-aged children, however there was no statistically significant change in obesity prevalence between 2007–2008 and 2009–2010. During 2009–2010, the prevalence of obesity was 12.1% among U.S. children aged 2–5 years with higher rates among some subgroups including non-Hispanic black (18.9%) and Hispanic (16.2%) children (1). Childhood obesity is associated with negative physical and mental health consequences (2). Overweight or obese preschoolers are five times as likely as to become overweight or obese adults as their non-obese peers (3). Preventing obesity early in life is a public health priority to improve health across the lifespan.\nNational estimates of the prevalence of obesity describe the extent of the problem for the U.S. population. However, state-specific obesity prevalence estimates provide opportunities for state and local health departments to monitor progress in controlling and preventing obesity. In addition, state-specific estimates are important because there is variability among states in demographic and other factors that might influence obesity and appropriate prevention strategies and decision-making related to programmatic efforts, environmental supports, and policies might differ.\nLimited studies are available on state-specific trends in obesity prevalence among young children. The few published reports focus on older school-aged children and adolescents (4–6) and use parent/child reports of height and weight to calculate body mass index (BMI) (4,5). Other reports on young children (7,8)* have used data from CDC's Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS); one report showed that among 44 states/territories during 2003–2008, nine showed a significant decline in obesity, 24 showed significant increases, and 11 showed no statistically significant change (7). The prevalence of obesity among low-income preschool children remains high. In 2011, the prevalence of obesity for all contributors to the PedNSS was 14.4%, was approximately 4% points higher than in the early 1990s† and varied considerably among states/territories. This report extends earlier PedNSS analyses (7,8) by examining the state-specific prevalence and trends of obesity during 2008–2011.\nMethods\nPedNSS is a state-based public health surveillance system that monitors the nutritional status of low-income children from birth through age 4 years. Data are primarily collected from participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). About 50% of low-income children eligible for WIC are enrolled (9), but data from other programs such as the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program, and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau Title V program are also included. Not all WIC agencies submitted data to the PedNSS during 2008–2011 (9). Data were collected from children and their caregivers during routine visits to local public health clinics approximately twice per year. Children's heights and weights were directly measured by trained clinical staff using standardized protocols. All data were submitted electronically to CDC. One randomly selected clinical record per child, per year, was used in this study. Obesity was defined as having an age- and sex-specific BMI ≥95th percentile according to the 2000 CDC growth charts.§\nThis study included approximately 12.1 million children aged 2–4 years from 43 PedNSS contributors, including 40 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories (U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico) that consistently reported data annually to PedNSS and used consistent methodology during 2008–2011. Height, weight, and BMI data that were missing (n = 258,310; 2.1%), miscoded (n = 8,124; 0.1%), or biologically implausible¶ (n = 285,572; 2.4%; e.g., height-for-age z-score <-5.0 or >3.0, weight-for-age z-score <-4.0 or >5.0, or BMI-for-age and sex z-score <-4.0 or >5.0) were excluded from all analyses, leaving an analytic sample of 11,590,087 low-income preschool children. The average sample size among states/territories across all years of study ranged from 2,516 to 294,209.\nThe state-specific prevalence of obesity among low-income preschoolers during 2008–2011 was calculated. To examine trends in the state-specific obesity prevalence during the study period, logistic regression models were used, adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were calculated to determine the estimated annual change in odds of obesity. To determine whether changes in obesity prevalence could be explained by socioeconomic status of participants, a secondary analysis was conducted that included household income as part of the adjusted model. AORs were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. Compared with the 2008 study population, the 2011 study population was older and included a slightly smaller proportion of non-Hispanic whites and a slightly larger proportion of non-Hispanic blacks (Table 1).\nResults\nDuring 2008–2011, a total of 19 states/territories reported significant downward trends in obesity prevalence among low-income preschoolers (Figure 1). Among them, the largest decline in obesity prevalence was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (AOR = 0.92; CI = 0.87–0.97), where there was a decrease in the prevalence of obesity from 13.6% in 2008 to 11.0% in 2011, an absolute decrease of 2.6 percentage points (Table 2). In five additional states (Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, and South Dakota) the absolute decrease in obesity prevalence from 2008 to 2011 was ≥1 percentage point. Across the 19 states/territories with significant downward trends, the absolute decrease in obesity prevalence from 2008 to 2011 ranged from 0.3 to 2.6 percentage points. The relative decreases in obesity prevalence among the 19 states/territories ranged from 1.8% to 19.1%.\nAn additional 21 states/territories experienced no significant trend in obesity prevalence. Three states experienced a significant upward trend in obesity prevalence. The absolute increase in obesity prevalence from 2008 to 2011 for the three states ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 percentage points. The relative increase in obesity prevalence among the three states ranged from 5.2% to 6.4%.\nIn a secondary analysis of the 34 states/territories that had complete data on household income, household income was added to the logistic regression model. Among these states/territories, significance changed for only one state. Montana went from no significant trend to a significant decrease in the prevalence of obesity (AOR = 0.97, CI = 0.94–1.00).\nIn 2011, the prevalence of obesity among states/territories in the study ranged from 9.2% to 17.9% (Table 2). Ten states/territories had an obesity prevalence ≥15% (Figure 2), with the highest prevalence in Puerto Rico (17.9%). Six states/territories had an obesity prevalence <12%. The lowest obesity prevalence was in Hawaii (9.2%).\nDiscussion\nIn recent years there have been small but significant decreases in childhood obesity. The finding that 19 states/territories experienced a decrease in obesity among low-income preschoolers, a vulnerable population, adds to recent findings from local data of low-income preschoolers (10,11) and studies observing decreases among children with higher socioeconomic status (SES) (12). The specific factors that might have contributed to the differential changes in obesity prevalence by state could not be readily identified. States likely differ by cultural and other factors that affect diet, activity, and weight as well as the implementation of policy and environmental interventions used to improve nutrition and physical activity. For example, reductions in obesity prevalence might reflect a combination of contributing factors, such as local and state initiatives that focus on the implementation of nutrition and physical activity standards for early care and education (ECE) programs (13) and efforts to improve healthier food options and physical activity offerings in communities (14). Federal policy changes such as the alignment of the WIC package of nutritious foods with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (15) might have led to improved diets among low-income preschool children and their families. Population-level changes in behavior such as increases in breastfeeding (16) also might have contributed to declines in obesity.\nDuring the same period, national initiatives such as Let's Move,** reports such as the White House Childhood Obesity Task Force Report,†† and recommendations from groups including the National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care and Early Education, American Public Health Association, American Academy of Pediatrics (13), and the Institute of Medicine (17) and media coverage have drawn attention to childhood obesity by building awareness and identifying stakeholders and potential actions to address the problem. Parents, schools, ECE providers, health-care providers, business leaders, the faith community, and state and local officials are among the groups identified in expert recommendations as stakeholders in the prevention of early childhood obesity. Each stakeholder makes decisions that influence the nutrition and physical activity environments where children live, learn, and play.\nState and local officials have a unique opportunity to bring together various stakeholders concerned about children's health. They can assist communities in conducting needs assessments, developing action plans, and launching initiatives aimed at increasing healthy eating and active living (18). State and local officials can support ECE providers by helping to identify and incorporate best practices for obesity prevention, including putting forth standards that promote healthy eating and physical activity (13), such as serving fruits and vegetables, limiting the regular consumption of sugary beverages (19), and providing more opportunities for physical activity, and reducing screen time. Officials also can help community groups and agencies identify or improve local play spaces to increase opportunities for physical activity (17,18) through efforts such as mapping, providing better access to recreational facilities, and promoting safety (19) in places where children can be physically active. Assisting local businesses and community groups in their support of families by educating them about healthful affordable food choices, providing point of decision prompts that promote healthy foods and beverages at the places they are purchased, providing opportunities for physical activity (17,18), increasing food store availability in underserved areas, and zoning for mixed land use (19) and improving access to safe, free drinking water in public places (18) are other ways that officials can help communities prevent childhood obesity. State and local officials also can engage communities in obesity prevention by leading or participating in coalitions (e.g., an obesity task force or food advisory council), and partnerships with groups in other sectors (18) like agriculture, retail, transportation, and economic development.\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, PedNSS is limited to low-income children who participated in federal nutrition programs. These findings might not reflect the obesity prevalence and trends among all low-income U.S. preschool-aged children. In addition, the results might not be reflective of preschool-aged children of higher socioeconomic status who might have experienced more substantial declines in obesity prevalence (12). Second, this study included 43 states/territories that consistently collected PedNSS data during 2008–2011. Trends in other states/territories might differ. Finally, compared with 2008, the number of children in PedNSS was higher in subsequent years (approximately 2.7 million in 2008, 3.0 million in 2009, 3.0 million in 2010, and 2.9 million in 2011). This might have been caused, in part, by the economic downturn, which might have led to previously ineligible families becoming eligible for these nutrition programs. Whether or the degree to which these changes might have contributed to declines in obesity is unknown. As compared to the 2008 cohort, the 2011 cohort was slightly older and included a slightly smaller proportion of non-Hispanics whites and a slightly larger proportion of non-Hispanic blacks. Adjustments for these characteristics in logistical regression models might not have eliminated all confounding. Further adjustment for household income (for 34 states/territories with complete income data) however had little effect; one state went from no change to a significant decline.\nSmall decreases in the prevalence of obesity among low-income preschool children have been observed in certain states/territories. Continued prevention efforts remain necessary to ensure that this downward trend continues. State and local officials have an opportunity to lead these efforts through the continued development, implementation, and evaluation of obesity prevention initiatives and by leading partnerships with public and private sectors.\nReported by\nAshleigh L.

Recommended community strategies and measurements to prevent obesity in the United States. MMWR 2009;58(No. RR-7).\n|\nKey Points\n|\n- The prevalence of obesity declined slightly among low-income preschoolers in 19 of 43 states and territories during 2008–2011.\n- Obesity rates are high among preschool children in the United States. Approximately one child in eight aged 2–5 years is obese.\n- Overweight or obese preschoolers are five times as likely to become overweight or obese adults, compared with their normal weight peers. In older children and adolescents, obesity is associated with high cholesterol, high blood sugar, asthma, and mental health problems.\n- To continue the downward trend in obesity, continued communitywide action is needed. State and local officials can help prevent obesity in young children by 1) creating partnerships with community members such as civic leaders and child-care providers to make changes that promote healthy eating and active living; 2) making it easier for families with children to buy healthy, affordable foods and beverages in their neighborhood; and 3) providing opportunities for children to play safely through access to community parks and other recreation areas.\n- Additional information is available at

A total of 19 states/territories reported significant downward trends in obesity prevalence. The largest percentage point decrease in obesity prevalence was in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where there was a decrease in the prevalence of obesity from 13.6% in 2008 to 11.0% in 2011.\nFIGURE 2.

In 2011, the prevalence of obesity among the states/territories ranged from 9.2% to 17.9%. Ten states/territories had an obesity prevalence ≥15%, with the highest prevalence in Puerto Rico (17.9%). Six states/territories had an obesity prevalence <12%. The lowest obesity prevalence was in Hawaii (9.2%).\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The fourth edition of the “Healthy Georgia: Our State of Public Health” report has been released by the Institute of Public and Preventive Health in Augusta University’s School of Public Health.\nWithin the 64 pages of the report is a snapshot of how healthy Georgians are compared to citizens across the 12 states that make up the Southeastern Region (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) and the entire United States. The 2025 edition addresses 31 health topics and has been expanded this year to include multimorbidity; long COVID-19; HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis infection rates; opioid and methamphetamine drug use; suicides; and vaping.\n“As Georgia’s preeminent public health sciences and medical research university, Augusta University plays a vital role in discussions about the health of our state’s citizens,” said Augusta University President Russell T. Keen. “Although our School of Public Health is the newest in the state, our Institute of Public and Preventive Health has been making significant contributions for many years, and our Georgia Prevention Institute has done so for decades. Faculty researchers from across our university, including the School of Public Health, the Medical College of Georgia, the Dental College of Georgia, the Georgia Cancer Center, the Immunology Center of Georgia, as well as the College of Allied Health Sciences, the College of Nursing and the College of Education and Human Development, are dedicated to improving the health of all Georgians, and this report is a vital part of that process.”\nThe report, which is the only one of its kind in the state, has been delivered to lawmakers, community leaders and researchers across Georgia to provide them with tangible figures on how Georgia is faring in numerous areas.\n“Each year, we strive to release a better, more comprehensive report than the year before, and this year is no exception,” said J. Aaron Johnson, PhD, director of IPPH and associate dean for Research and Community Engagement in SPH. “Dr. Datta and his team have worked hard to collect and analyze the most recent data and present it in a way that will stimulate conversations about public health needs in our state and, in turn, promote action, including policy changes, greater community engagement and the appraisal of funds that will help all Georgians live healthier lives.”\nThe mission of the School of Public Health is to address Georgia’s distinct public health challenges through exceptional education, innovative research and collaborative community engagement.\n“The Healthy Georgia Report is an important tool for benchmarking the health of Georgians and highlighting opportunities for improvement,” said Teresa Waters, PhD, founding dean of SPH. “I am proud of the work that Dr. Datta and his team have put into this report, continuing to expand the topics covered so it can better serve our policymakers, health care professionals and the citizens of Georgia.”\nBiplab Datta, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Health Management, Economics, and Policy in SPH, heads up the team of IPPH faculty and staff who create the report each year. Datta credits Jen Jaremski, research associate, and Kit Wooten, public health analyst, with handling much of the work of bringing the report to life. Together, Jaremski and Wootten collected and organized all of the needed assets and organized the 64-page document, preparing it for print and the web.\n“Every year we strive to present data in a way that policymakers may find helpful in making policy choices,” Datta said. “There are several new topics that were added to this year’s report and some of those are concerning for the state of Georgia, particularly the communicable diseases like HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. High prevalence rates of these conditions in Georgia, compared to the rest of the U.S. and the Southeastern Region, warrant attention of the public health community.”\nGeorgia has the second-highest rate of HIV infections in the U.S., fourth-highest rates of gonorrhea, sixth-highest for chlamydia and 13th for syphilis.\nSomething that is also new in this year’s report is a comparison of numbers from 2019, or before the COVID-19 pandemic began, compared to after the pandemic for certain conditions.\nAlso coming out of the pandemic, the report looks at how long COVID has affected Georgians, with the state ranking 24th in the nation for rates of long COVID. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, long COVID is defined as a chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months.\nOn top of looking at comparisons between Georgia and the Southeast and the nation, Datta noted a clearer picture is starting to emerge concerning the difference in urban and rural areas within the state.\n“For several chronic conditions, like hypertension, diabetes and multimorbidity, we clearly see a striking difference between rural and urban residents of Georgia,” Datta said.\nHypertension affects 44.1% of adults in rural Georgia compared to 35% in urban areas, while diabetes affects 17.5% of adults in rural Georgia compared to 12.3% of those in urban areas. Hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which affects 12.2% of adults in rural areas compared to 8.3% of adults in urban areas of Georgia.\n“Hypertension and diabetes are the major risk factors for heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and worldwide, so these are some concerning numbers to see,” Datta said.\nMultimorbidity, which is when a person has multiple chronic conditions, including obesity, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, cancer, skin cancer and arthritis, affects 57.4% of adults in rural Georgia compared to 49% of adults in urban areas of the state. These rates are significantly lower than the rest of the Southeast but on par with the rest of the country.\nWhen comparing Georgia to the U.S. national average, adults in Georgia have lower rates of cancer and methamphetamine use but higher rates of childhood asthma and adult obesity. At the same time, rates of adult asthma and adult obesity among Georgians were comparable to the averages seen in the Southeast. Interestingly, while adult health insurance coverage was significantly lower than the U.S. national and Southeast Regional averages, the child health insurance coverage in Georgia was comparable to both national and regional averages.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        (�/� X�� ���3�d��[�iv���\"����k�@R�����+u%}�m���^�/�-x� ) �J)�y;��O���[:�w̲i�i_������|V���è%i��o���c���g�)��U��靳E�0s�A��m��7u�Y] {�Q� ێ�M9��/�!��նq?ĸ��Pl#�m�k��N�Kn �YY�C���,�E�Ժ��Ok2�_ �H�Z�?ӎ����M9�n�vm;ݢGt�v:�8�dZz������iGN*-��1��Fm�T|��k���PQ�t7a*2*0��[X�ٱ��[�T����Q1�����l���qH�~س�����u����L� 3w���i^��Yw�y�z�u��ʯ����g?� 9�����bU�i�Q��F��۴����k������W��{�S�0j�\\b���65K��\"��]��tv���l������ \"�R��]�����U�~m]#��i���m��} ��.B��=���wȷ�Ѭ{�9��몝�zCn�s��+����kȃ��b��qS$ӡ���)8$t�u>�����m�A�!��.�2a`xX�|��ѱ��觡���$���Ȉ�ئ���W�e\"(8<��Gˎ3<�LEG�_E�GG��(*2��L�6i/�e�^pʼ�46.::*:\"$0�ӵ�5��0jk��ZB��]��0R��F��H:�S���p�$��K$!�[t�m��{��Ȗ���)g�Ani����]U+�q͵4g4�MH�88T6M)���8�P+/� ����Z�O-�`�K�,[e�[�wܗEn��a�Y�n�]J o�\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Kleefisch defeated Mahlon Mitchell (D) in the recall on June 5, 2012. A primary election took place May 8.[1]\nSupporters of the recall submitted approximately 845,000 signatures on January 17, 2012. In order to qualify the recall question for the ballot at least 540,208 had to be valid.[2]\nThe Wisconsin Government Accountability Board certified about 809,000 signatures on March 30 and scheduled a primary on May 8 and general election on June 5.[3][4]\nPath to the ballot\nUnited Wisconsin, under the name the Committee to Recall Kleefisch, filed a recall petition on November 15, 2011. They had 60 days to collect 540,208 valid signatures, which had to be turned in by January 17, 2012.[5]\nA second recall petition was filed against Kleefisch by a group calling itself Wisconsin Common Sense Citizens for Accountability and Recall aka Recall Walker Political Action Committee on November 18. Randy Bryce, treasurer of the Walker Recall PAC, said they were specifically targeting Republicans and Independents and hoped to work with United Wisconsin. \"If they don't have enough and they need some more, well, here you go. It's kind of like an insurance policy,\" he said.[6]\nOn January 17, 2012, recall organizers submitted some 845,000 signatures to recall Kleefisch. The process of validating the signatures took several months, with GAB completing their work on March 30.[7] In response, Kleefisch stated \"we’re proud of what happened over the last year and month of our time in office because we have seen tremendous reform in the state of Wisconsin and the reforms are working.”[8]\nSignature verification\nUnder state law, the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board had 31 days to determine if enough valid signatures were submitted to force a recall. However, with 1.9 million signatures to review for six recalls, they asked a judge for extra time on January 20, 2012. Dane County Circuit Judge Richard Niess granted the extension on January 25, giving the board an additional 30 days.[9]\nThe state purchased software from Artsyl Technologies to help with the process. Workers scanned the petitions into computers and the software read the names and converted them into type. A human operator verified the name, correcting any errors before it was entered into a database. The databases could then be used to check for duplicate signatures.[10]\nThe petitions were processed in a secret location, but a webcam was set up to provide a live feed of the work.[11]\nUnder state law, Kleefisch had only 10 days to challenge the validity of the petitions starting on January 18. However, as GAB officials were not able to readily provide Kleefisch with the signatures against her, Dane County Circuit Judge Richard Niess extended the period to 30 days from when Kleefisch received the full petitions.[12] She had until March 5 to file a challenge,[13] but announced on March 1 that she would not be challenging any of the signatures.[14]\nOpponents\nKleefisch defeated Mahlon Mitchell (D) in the recall on June 5, 2012.\n| Recall of Wisconsin Lt.

Cory Mason said on December 8, 2011, that he was \"giving serious consideration\" to a run for the office, but ultimately did not file to run.[21]\nLegal issues\nJoint recall for governor and lieutenant governor\nAn opinion issued November 3, 2011, by Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen found that, although they run on the same ticket, a recall targeting the governor would not automatically include the Lieutenant Governor. In order to recall both officials, separate petitions would have to be submitted, with separate recall elections held. Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate said they still planned to target both.[22]\nWalker lawsuit\nOn December 15, Walker's campaign and the state Republican Party director filed suit against the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board in Waukesha County Circuit Court. The lawsuit asked that a judge require GAB to search for and strike duplicate signatures, fake names and illegible addresses.\nStephan Thompson, executive director of the state Republican Party, stated, \"The decision of one individual who chooses to sign a recall petition should not carry more weight than the decision of another who chooses not to sign. This lawsuit seeks to protect the Wisconsin electors whose voices have been trumped by those purposefully signing multiple petitions.\"[23]\nGAB typically reviews signatures to ensure there are enough to trigger a recall and verify they include a Wisconsin address and are dated during the recall period. It is up to challengers to point out potential issues with signatures.[24]\nOn December 20, the Recall Walker Committee, as well as the committees to recall Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and three Republican state senators, filed a motion asking a judge to dismiss the suit. They argued that the suit was designed to create uncertainty, disruptions and expenses in the recall process.[25] At a hearing on December 29, Judge Mac Davis, a former Republican state senator, denied the motion to intervene, citing the need for speed and desire to avoid possible \"chaos\" that could come if new parties were allowed in the case.[26]\nDavis issued a ruling on January 5, 2012, stating that GAB must take \"reasonable\" actions to eliminate duplicate and illegal signatures from recall petitions. However, he gave them discretion to decide how to achieve that, noting that requiring such action \"is limited by the resources and ability they have or are reasonably able to obtain.\" GAB Director Kevin Kennedy said they had to discuss the decision in order to determine what procedures in their process needed change.[27]\nOn February 3, the Fourth District Court of Appeals in Madison overturned the ruling that denied recall organizers from joining the suit, stating that they had a valid interest to join. The ruling also threw out Judge Davis' decision that GAB must actively seek to strike fake and duplicate signatures. The case then went back to Davis.[28]\nCost of recall\n| \"The Value of a Signature\" video by Kleefisch, released the day the recall campaign began |\nIn a November 15, 2011, video called \"The Value of a Signature,\" Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch stated a statewide recall election would cost \"$7.7 million - $7.7 million that may already be allocated to merit raises for teachers or health care for the poor or school books for your kids.\"\nA PolitiFact analysis released November 23, 2011, rated Kleefisch's claim as \"Half True.\" The $7.7 million figure was reached by taking the estimated $2.1 million it cost for the nine state senate recalls in the summer of 2011 and applying it to all 33 Senate districts. PolitiFact stated, \"Kleefisch’s basic math is accurate -- and her estimate might even be low.\" They noted, however, that she stated the figure as fact rather than an estimate.[29]\nPolitiFact said Kleefisch provided no evidence for the second half of her claim - that money would be used from funds already designated for school or health care. However, they noted that money for the election could have come from funds designated for other programs.\nAccording to data released by the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board on January 6, 2012, the cost of a recall against Walker was estimated at a minimum of $9 million. GAB asked election clerks around the state to estimate the costs of a possible recall election based on November 2010 and April 2011 elections. The 72 county clerks reported an estimate at $2.35 million, while municipal clerks reported $5.82 million. GAB estimated its costs at $841,349.[30]\nWisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate acknowledged the estimate, stating, “the $9 million cost of a statewide recall election is great, but the cost of doing nothing is far greater. This undertaking is the biggest investment in the future of our state and families we can make.”[31]\nThe estimates were requested by Rep. Robin Vos (R) who was seeking to limit recall elections. Vos criticized the recalls as a waste of taxpayer money, stating, \"It's about time taxpayers learned the cost of these unnecessary recall elections. The citizens of Wisconsin should have known the estimated cost on local governments before a single petition was circulated. Is this how they want their valuable taxpayer dollars spent?\"[32]\nCampaign contributions\n| People for Rebecca Campaign Finance Reports (GAB ID No. 0104890) | |||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Report | Date Filed | Beginning Balance | Total Contributions | (Expenditures) | Cash on Hand | ||||\n| Special Pre-Primary 2012 report[33] | April 30, 2012 | $87,917.71 | $540,562.20 | $(203,623.97) | $424,855.94 | ||||\n| Recall 60 day report[34] | January 23, 2012 | $72,549.96 | $34,061.00 | $(18,693.25) | $87,917.71 | ||||\n| January Continuing report[35] | January 23, 2012 | $74,670.12 | $6,635.00 | $(8,755.16) | $72,549.96 | ||||\n| Recall 30 day report[36] | December 15, 2011 | $26,155.43 | $86,743.01 | $(45,004.25) | $67,894.19 |\nAds relating to the campaign\nAdditional reading\n- The Cap Times, \"Why it’s important to recall Kleefisch too,\" December 14, 2011\n- Channel 3000, \"Kleefisch: 'I'll Be Back On The Ballot',\" January 9, 2012\n- Today's TMJ4, \"Lt.

These estimates are based on the current proposal in the Michigan State Legislature, which will also require City Council and voter approval.\nIt’s time to lower Detroit’s property taxes. Land Value Tax Plan Brochure has all the details.\nOur Mission\nDetroit’s Land Value Tax Plan is a way for Detroit voters to decide whether to cut homeowners’ taxes by an average of 17% and pay for it by increasing taxes on abandoned buildings, parking lots, scrapyards, and other similar properties.\nThe Michigan Legislature would have to approve legislation no later than Summer 2024 to be placed on the November 2024 ballot. Homeowners would see the full tax cut in 2025.\nState Representative Stephanie Young from Detroit is the sponsor of the Lansing legislation.\nLearn More with Our Land Value Tax Plan FAQs\nThe Problem\nUnder Detroit’s property tax system, blight is rewarded and building is punished. Detroit homeowners pay among the highest property taxes in Michigan.\nOwners of abandoned buildings, scrapyards, and parking lots pay very little.\nTwo-Part Land Value Tax Plan\n- Cut tax mills on buildings by 14 mills\n- More than double taxes on land.\nLand Value Tax Plan FAQs\nThe Land Value Tax Plan modernizes Michigan’s outdated, one-size-fits-all municipal tax structure by allowing municipalities like Detroit to replace certain taxes on property improvements (including homes, buildings and other structures).\nThe Land Value Tax Plan allows local governments to put money back into the pockets of their residents, reduce blight and tax foreclosures, encourage reinvestment and support small businesses.\n- Michigan’s current municipal tax structure is broken and creates an unfair tax burden on homeowners and small businesses in some communities.\n- The current system also unfairly rewards land speculators, discourages investment and improvements while saddling homeowners with a growing tax burden.\n- As some municipalities have lost residents and vacant lots have increased, the tax burden on property owners has increased, which is why the Land Value Tax Plan is necessary.\n- The Land Value Tax Plan is supported by a broad, bipartisan coalition that transcends political and geographic lines.\n- The coalition agrees Michigan’s rigid approach to its municipal property tax code is overburdening Detroit’s homeowners and small businesses.\n- The coalition includes the City of Detroit, housing affordability advocates, faith leaders, small-business associations and more.\n- No. The Land Value Tax Plan can benefit communities throughout Michigan that want to use it to attract new development and investments, revitalize neighborhoods and address blight.\n- The Land Value Tax Plan gives communities a CHOICE to modernize their municipal tax structures to reduce tax rates for homeowners and small businesses.\n- The Land Value Tax Plan also allows communities to hold land speculators and owners of vacant, unused or unproductive land accountable through imposing a higher tax burden on holding those properties undeveloped.\nThe average Detroit homeowner will get a 17% permanent property tax cut in 2025. 97% of all Detroit homeowners will get a tax cut.\nThe legislation guarantees no Detroit homeowner gets a tax increase from the Land Value Tax plan.\nDetroit’s millage for operations would be cut by 14 mills, from 20 mills to 6 mills for improvements to all taxable property. That cut applies to apartments, retail stores, office buildings, homes, and land.\nThe 14 mill cut reduces the homeowner’s property taxes in this way:\n| Current Homeowner Tax | Change under Land Value Tax |\n|---|---|\n| Detroit Operating 20 Mills | Detroit Operating 6 Mills |\n| Detroit Debt 7 Mills | Detroit Debt 7 Mills |\n| School Operating 6 Mills | School Operating 6 Mills |\n| School Debt 13 Mills | School Debt 13 Mills |\n| County 17 Mills | County 17 Mills |\n| Libraries 4 Mills | Libraries 4 Mills |\n| Total 67 Mills | Total 53 Mills |\n(County mills include county, parks, ISD, WCCCD, Zoo, DIA)\nToday, Detroit homeowners pay among the highest property taxes in Michigan. Under the Land Value Tax, Detroit’s property tax rates will become competitive with neighboring cities like Southfield, Ferndale, Warren, and Grosse Pointe. The attached map illustrates that change.\nLand values in Detroit are very low. Large millage increases on land don’t result in large tax burdens. The land mills will be increased by approximately 104 mills.\nThe average vacant residential lot in Detroit currently pays $30 a lot. The Land Value Tax will increase the taxes to an average of $67 per lot.\nUrban farms, community gardens, and community spaces will not be affected by the Land Value Tax. They are deemed community space under the proposal.\nNo homeowner will get an overall tax increase if they own 4 side lots or less. The average bill on a side lot will go up about $30 a lot, from $25 to approximately $55. The average homeowner will get a tax cut on their house that is much larger than that. If you are the exception where the increase in your side lot tax is more than the tax cut on your home, you will receive a credit. You will have no overall tax increase as a result of the Land Value Tax.\nYes. You can choose whichever option is better for you. If you have an NEZ break, you can keep that break until your 15 year period runs out. When your NEZ period ends, you will automatically receive the permanent Land Value Tax break.\nNo. NEZ’s have created tax inequity among Detroit neighborhoods. Existing NEZ holders will be grandfathered. But no new NEZ’s will be granted afterward. As the existing NEZ’s phase out, all Detroit neighborhoods will pay the same tax rate.\nThe tax on the vacant land will more than double. The millage rate on land will increase an estimated 104 mills, going from 85 mills today to approximately 189 mills.\nThe land tax will more than double, but these owners will get a 14-mill tax cut on any improvements on the property. The effects will vary, but should average about a 50% increase in property taxes.\nThe total Summer levies add up to 76 mills, which is why the Summer tax bill shows 76 mills at the bottom of the page. However, if you have Principal Residence Exemption, then the 17 mills of School Operating tax will say “EXEMPT”. Subtract these 17 mills from the 76 total to get 59 mills. This is your Summer millage. In Winter, you will pay another 9 mills for a total of 68 mills in 2023. Then in 2024, the total millage will go down to 67 because the City will reduce the debt millage by 1.\nEstimator FAQs\nThe estimate provided is for the sum of your summer and winter taxes and does not include any other fees (such as solid waste fee or penalties). So it won’t match your summer tax bill, but instead the sum of your summer and winter tax bills. Additionally, the estimate is based on the assessment data as of June 30th, 2023, including the taxable value and any abatements or exemptions you may have had at that time. Your tax bill may vary if there have been any adjustments or changes since then, such as change in ownership or approval of a HOPE exemption.\nThe NEZ Homestead saves homeowners about 20% whereas the LVT saves homeowners 17% on average. Until the NEZ expires, the homeowner will receive whichever is the larger savings. Most homeowners will see a slight increase after the NEZ expires, but will see savings versus if there was no NEZ or LVT. Some homeowners will see an immediate savings under LVT based on the value of land. NEZ Rehabs and NEZ News often see a large tax increase once the abatement expires, but the LVT will result in a smaller increase.\nHomeowners with a 100% HOPE exemption or veteran exemption will continue to pay $0 in property taxes. Homeowners with a partial exemption may have a further decrease or no change.\nPersonal property is not impacted by the proposed LVT plan. Only real property will see a change in the way their tax bills are calculated.\nThe lookup tool only shows estimated tax bill changes for residential homes. If you are a homeowner with side lot(s), the average increase per side lot is $25-30. Nearly all homeowners with side lots will have net savings due to a larger tax decrease on their home. However, the LVT plan guarantees that no homeowner with four side lots or fewer will see a net increase.\nThis estimator only shows estimated tax bill changes for residential homes. If you own commercial/ industrial property, personal property, and/or vacant land (such as side lots), the website does not have the capability to calculate your estimated tax bill change. If you just purchased your home from the Detroit Land Bank Authority, recently changed homeowner status, or recently received an exemption or abatement, the change may not be reflected in the data yet, which is current as of June 30, 2023. If you cannot find your address or parcel number you can search for it on Detroit Parcel Viewer.\nWhile an estimated 97% of homeowners would see a decrease in their tax bill under the LVT plan, some homeowners will see no change, particularly if they own parcels with a significant amount of land. If you own your home and see an increase, then you may not have a Principal Residence Exemption on your property and should contact the Office of the Assessor or email [email protected].\nPlease send an email with your inquiry to [email protected].\nCompare Detroit's Neighboring Cities Property Tax Rates\nHow To Enact a Land Value Tax Plan in Detroit?\nThe Michigan Legislature can allow for real tax relief for homeowners and small businesses through legislation that allows cities like Detroit the choice to adopt the Land Value Tax Plan.\nThis legislation would help local governments maintain a stable revenue stream and discourage blight and land speculation. And while the Land Value Tax Plan may not be the right choice for every community, research shows it would be a major boost for Detroit.\nThe legislation would empower local voters in municipalities to decide whether the Land Value Tax Plan is right for their community.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Governor Abbott Signs Largest Property Tax Cut In Texas History\nGovernor Greg Abbott today ceremonially signed legislation delivering the largest property tax cut in Texas history—$18 billion—passed during Special Session #2 of the 88th Legislature in New Caney. The Governor was joined at the historic bill signing by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Speaker Dade Phelan, Senator Paul Bettencourt, Representative Morgan Meyer, and other members of the Texas Legislature.\n\"Today, I am signing a law that will ensure more than $18 billion in property tax cuts—the largest property tax cut in Texas history,\" said Governor Abbott. \"If passed by voters this fall, Texas homestead exemptions will rise to $100,000, senior homeowners will be protected from being priced out of their home, the small business exemption for the Franchise Tax will double, and Texas small businesses will be protected from excessive appraisal increases. None of these monumental changes could have been accomplished without the hard work of Lieutenant Governor Patrick and Speaker Phelan. We all came together to offer Texans the property tax relief they so desperately deserve, and I am proud to sign these new laws today.\"\nIn his 2023 State of the State address, Governor Abbott made cutting property taxes for Texans an emergency item for the 88th Legislature. Under Senate Bill 2 and Senate Bill 3, $18 billion of Texas' historic budget surplus will be allocated toward driving down school district property tax rates, increasing homestead exemptions for Texas homeowners, and increasing Franchise Tax exemptions and appraisal caps for small businesses.\n\"The signing of this Texas-sized tax cut, the biggest property tax cut in history, is a massive victory for all 5.7 million Texas homeowners,\" said Lieutenant Governor Patrick. \"The combination of compression and the $100,000 homestead exemption is a powerful one-two punch that will cut school property taxes for the average priced home by $1,250 to $1,450 every year on their homesteaded property.\"\n\"As the saying goes, everything is bigger in Texas—and now that includes property tax relief,\" said Speaker Phelan. \"At the start of the session, state leaders set out to pass legislation that would provide relief in a way that property owners would actually see and feel. This $18 billion package—the largest in the country—will do just that. I appreciate the hard work of all House members who helped make this historic achievement possible and am grateful to our Senate counterparts for working with our chamber to get this done.\"\n\"Governor Abbott just signed the greatest tax cut in the history of the world,\" said Senator Bettencourt. \"It’s a fabulous $18 billion tax reduction bill, and every Texan will see huge savings on their tax bill. It was a great joy working with the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker, House, and Representatives Meyer and Metcalf.\"\n\"I want to thank the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Speaker for their leadership on this issue,\" said Representative Meyer. \"It was fantastic to be able to work with the Senate to deliver this historic tax relief to the state of Texas. This absolutely, unequivocally shows that we listen to our constituents.\"\nSenate Bill 2 (Bettencourt/Meyer) provides property tax relief through tax rate compression, an increase in the homestead exemption, and a pilot project limiting the growth in appraised values. For tax year 2023, this will save the average Texas homestead owner over $1,200. Texas homestead owners over 65 or with a disability will see over $1,400 in savings.\nSenate Bill 3 (Bettencourt/Geren) law increases the Franchise Tax “no tax due” threshold to $2.47 million and removes burdensome filing requirements for those who do not owe tax.\nThe constitutional amendment to provide the largest property tax cut in Texas history will be added to the Texas Constitution if approved by a simple majority of Texas voters on November 7, 2023.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        CONTACT:\nLaura Strimple, (402) 580-9495\nAllan Urlis, (531) 510-8529\nGov. Pillen Touts Passage of Bills at Signing Ceremony,\nSays Much More is Left to Be Done for Property Tax Relief\nLINCOLN, NE – Governor Jim Pillen hosted a news conference and bill signing yesterday with invited state senators who supported passage of legislative initiatives introduced during the special session, aimed at fixing the state’s rising property tax crisis. The session was convened by the Governor on July 25. It adjourned, sine die, mid-afternoon.\n“LB 34 is an important step forward,” said Gov. Pillen. “I appreciate the efforts of Sen. Lou Ann Linehan, members of the Revenue and Appropriations committees and the other senators here today who brought substantive ideas and fought hard on behalf of Nebraskans. This is not a one-and-done issue. It’s the top concern that Nebraskans talk to me about wherever I go, and it needs to be addressed so we are no longer chasing seniors out of their homes and killing the dream of home ownership for young people.”\nLawmakers passed LB 34, a property tax reduction measure, introduced by Sen. Tom Brewer. The bill features two main components. It provides for the frontloading of refundable income tax credits to offset school property taxes. Known as the School District Property Tax Relief Credit program, it will provide a significant benefit to taxpayers who have not claimed the credit when filing their taxes.\n“This is a big deal,” said Gov. Pillen. “We’re making sure that 45 percent of Nebraskans who have not been getting that credit will now receive a 20 percent property tax cut.”\nThe bill also limits taxing authority by cities and counties year-over-year to the greater of inflation or 0%. It includes an exemption for public safety needs, including law enforcement, fire, emergency medical services, corrections, county attorneys and public defenders.\nSen. Linehan touted the significance of that part of the plan saying, “Putting caps on spending is the only real answer to fixing this. The reason our property taxes are high is because we have too many taxing authorities spending too much money. Finally, anything that is over three percent in revenue growth can go to property tax relief.”\nGov. Pillen gave early indication of a special session during delivery of his sine die address to lawmakers at the end of the regular legislative session in April. He followed up quickly by convening a workgroup of senators who he met with throughout the summer, to generate wide-ranging ideas for addressing the state’s property tax crisis.\nIn early May, the Governor launched the first of more than two dozen town halls across the state, all focused on escalating property taxes. That was followed by release of The Nebraska Plan to Cut Property Taxes, a comprehensive plan designed to provide up to 40% relief which was introduced during the start of the session as LB1. In late June, Gov. Pillen sent a letter to Speaker John Arch, indicating his intent to formally call a special session, which was followed up with a proclamation one month later.\nState Treasurer Tom Briese congratulated his former legislative colleagues for their work, but echoed sentiments that the pursuit for more substantive property tax relief was far from over. He pointed to LB 1, which he said would have significantly addressed the property tax issue and was almost unanimously approved by the Governor’s working group.\n“Unfortunately, lobbyists and special interests got in the way. Going forward, they will need to decide if they are serious about property tax relief, or they just want to talk about it,” cautioned Treasurer Briese.\n“There’s nobody here who wants to see the state shrink,” said Gov. Pillen. “If we want to keep growing our state, we need to keep plugging away.”\nIn addition to the primary property tax relief bill, the Governor also signed a corresponding appropriations bill (LB 34A) and two budget bills to help offset costs associated with LB 34. LB 2 and LB 3 were introduced on behalf of the Governor by Senator Rob Clements. All had an attached emergency clause, making them effective immediately with the Governor’s signature.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Trump said the DNC \"had no American flags on this massive stage.\"\nTrump tweeted that flags were only added to the DNC stage after Republicans had complained about it.\nFact-checking websites were split on the claim but agreed there were American flags present at the convention.\nSnopes found that conservative websites used misleading images to show that there were flags at the recent Republican National Convention in Cleveland and not at the DNC.\nTrump said said in Scranton that during the RNC, \"Somebody said 'I can't see you Mr. Trump, there's too many flags.'

On Monday fellow former SNL 1994-1995 cast member Sarah Silverman and now Minnesota Senator Al Franken took the stage at the DNC in what became a joke heavy and then unsuccessful attempt at party unity between Clinton supporters and the Bernie Sanders delegates.\nLaying out a litany of political sins against Dems’ nominee Clinton, ex-President Bill Clinton’s speech last night, the DNC email hack scandal, praising the RNC, the polls and the convention itself – particularly the status of the former Secretary of State’s real stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, Trump’ comments on Wednesday come after a flood of similar remarks he put out on Twitter on Wednesday:\nNot one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2016\nTrump also took his time on the stage to promise Russian President Vladimir Putin would respect America if he was POTUS, praising the RNC last week and his polls. “Honestly, they have no idea if it’s Russia, might be Russia” the Republican candidate told the assemble media and the camera, also noting reports that the DNC hack was carried out by China or even a lone hacker.At one point in the press conference, Trump seemed to encourage Russia to find the tens of thousands of private emails of Hillary Clinton’s that were seemingly delated before the FBI investigation of the private server she had while at the State Department from 2009 to 2013.\nTonight’s DNC see current VP Joe Biden speak to the delegates in Philadelphia as well as VP nominee Tim Kaine. The star attraction is President Barack Obama, who is expected to lay out the case for putting his former cabinet member in the White House as well as a look back at his own administration – which Trump could live-Tweet.\nThe press should be demanding that Donald release his tax returns. THAT’s what the Russians should be hacking.\nBig mouth Donald Trump is not qualified for POTUS. He has no foreign policy experience. He can only assert the problems in tbe U.S. but offers no real solutions. Really building a wall will keep out the undesirables? Who will build it and with whose money? Theorically Trump has money to do these things he spouts off about but has done nothing about it. Mr. Rich guy where’s the hospitals for veterans that you have the means to build with but havent? With your money you should have been doing these good things you promise a long time ago. Will you go to bankruptcy and stiff the workers again? Hillary Clinton may not be perfect but is the better choice for POTUS.\nFlags? He’s whining about flags? Here’s the difference between him and us. We care about American lives – his party only cares about pieces of cloth. This is not going to be a good Nov. for him.\nHILLARY/KAINE 2016!\nTrump is … 100 percent right about Hillary and the lack of media access/press conferences. For all his word salad jibberish, he continues to pound his opponent in ways previous GOP candidates wouldn’t dream of … and that’s a small part of the reason why they all lost.\nYou’d think GOP politicians would learn something about Trump’s successful approach in this arena. Guarantee they haven’t learned a thing.\nTrue and I think Bernie would’ve won the nomination if he would have went after Hillary like Trump went after Jeb.\nYou will never be able to convince me that Donald Trump has to, with great reluctance, stand up and command the attention of the press, the general public, dogs and action figures, local children at the playground. Never.\nBut he does make a point about Clinton hiding behind a giant wall.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}
