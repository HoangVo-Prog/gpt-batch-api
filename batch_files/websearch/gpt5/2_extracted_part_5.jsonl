The lowest-earning three-fifths of Americans would pay more on average in federal taxes, while the top 40 percent on average would receive a tax cut. The bill would increase the deficit because of the substantial tax breaks it would provide to the wealthy and to foreign investors who own stocks in American corporations and who would therefore benefit from the bill’s corporate tax cuts.\nIn 2027, the richest 1 percent of Americans would receive an average tax cut of more than $9,000 while the bottom three-fifths of income earners would face an average tax hike of $160. In some states, low- and middle-income earners would have larger average tax increases. (See state-by-state figures in the appendix.)\nThe legislation is described as tax reform but would cut hundreds of billions of dollars in health care spending. The provision recently added to the legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate would result in 13 million fewer people obtaining health insurance and a 10 percent increase in premiums for people in the non-group health insurance market, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).[1]\nThe rest of the bill includes permanent provisions to raise taxes, permanent provisions to cut taxes on corporations, and temporary provisions to cut taxes on individuals that expire after 2025. Republican leaders in Congress have stated that they have made the tax cuts for individuals temporary to comply with the budget rules regarding the “reconciliation” process they are using to pass the bill with just 51 votes, but they also argue that Congress will, in the future, extend the temporary provisions without regard to their effect on the deficit.\nThe reconciliation rules allow this bill to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over a decade, as set out in a budget resolution already approved by Congress, but this is not sufficient to allow all the tax cuts in the bill. So the Finance Committee senators made some tax cuts temporary and added a provision to cut the federal government’s spending on health care by repealing the health insurance mandate.\nUnder the bill as written, the provisions affecting corporations would remain in effect in years after 2025, but of the provisions affecting individuals, the only two remaining in effect would be revenue-raisers. One would raise taxes by using an inflation measure that would more quickly shift middle-class income into higher tax brackets and gradually make provisions like the Earned Income Tax Credit less generous. (This measure is often called the chained consumer price index or chained CPI).\nThe other revenue-raiser is the provision repealing the mandate to obtain health insurance. This would result in a small revenue loss because no one would pay the penalty that is in effect today for some individuals who go without health insurance. But it would also result in a much larger revenue gain because some who would no longer be covered are those who receive tax credits to pay insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. Fewer premium tax credits would be paid out, resulting in a revenue gain.[2]\nUnder the Senate bill, at least 29 percent of households would pay higher taxes in 2027 than they would under current law. Among the bottom three-fifths of income-earners, 33 percent would pay higher taxes in 2027. While most of the figures in this analysis include the tax impacts of the health insurance mandate repeal as well as other provisions in the bill, the estimated share of taxpayers with a tax increase does not include the effects of the mandate repeal. (While the impact of the mandate on each income group can be determined, it is more difficult to identify the precise number of taxpayers affected in each income group.) This means that the share of taxpayers with a tax hike is likely to be greater than what is estimated here.\nThe figures in the graphs and tables in this report do not account for other effects from the repeal of the health insurance mandate, including a reduction in Medicaid spending and the increase in health insurance premiums. In other words, many lower- and middle-income people will be worse off than these figures demonstrate.\nAs explained in the methodology section, this analysis follows the approach of Congress’s official revenue estimator in assuming that by 2027, one-fourth of the benefits from the bill’s corporate tax cuts would go to workers, meaning these benefits are assumed to be distributed as salaries, wages, and other forms of earned income are distributed across the population. This analysis takes this approach because many economists claim that lower corporate taxes lead companies in the United States to invest more in ways that will increase hiring and raise wages in the long run. But it is very unclear when or if this would ever happen. The benefits might instead remain entirely concentrated on those who own corporate stocks, which are mostly held by high-income households. In other words, the figures shown here are probably a best-case scenario for low- and middle-income people.\nThis analysis also finds that foreign investors would receive a significant share of the benefits — $22 billion in 2027. As explained in the methodology section, corporate tax cuts mostly benefit the owners of corporate stocks, and recent research finds that foreign investors own 35 percent of stocks in American corporations. The benefits flowing to foreign investors would be slightly larger than the $18 billion increase in taxes paid by the bottom three-fifths of income-earners in 2027.\nIn fact, by 2027 foreign investors would benefit more than American households overall under the bill as written. While some households would pay more and others would pay less, in 2027 the average net effect for U.S. households would be a tax cut of $8 billion, which is much smaller than the $22 billion benefit to foreign investors.\nEven in 2019, the plan is not designed to benefit the American middle class. The benefits going to foreign investors would amount to $31 billion in 2019. The net tax cuts going to the middle fifth of income earners in 2019, the literal middle-class, would be only $22 billion. The lowest-income 40 percent would receive benefits smaller than that.\nThe share of households facing a tax increase in 2019 would be lower but still surprising at 10 percent. Of the benefits going to households in the U.S. in 2019, a quarter would go to the richest 1 percent and half would go to the richest 5 percent.\nThere would be some taxpayers in every state paying more under the Senate bill, but in 2027 19 states would even pay more overall, meaning the populations of these states as a whole would pay more in federal taxes than they would if current law were left unchanged.\nThe reason some states are more affected than others in 2027 has to do partly with the fact that the tax credits that help people pay health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act are more significant in some states than others, and some of these credits would no longer be paid out because of the repeal of the health insurance mandate under the bill. Based on the most recent IRS data, 16 of the 18 states with the most significant total premium tax credits received in 2015 (measured as a share of the total income of people in the state) are among the states that would have overall tax increases in 2027. (The two exceptions are Vermont, which would have a net impact of about zero dollars in 2027, and the other is California.) The three other states receiving an overall net tax increase in 2027 would be North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia.\nMethodology\nThis analysis incorporates all the significant provisions in the Senate tax plan, including any that cost at least $50 billion or raise at least $50 billion over 10 years according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), which provides the official estimates used by Congress.[3]\nThe proposed changes to the international corporate tax rules, including adoption of a “territorial” tax system and other changes, are included in their entirety because of the many ways in which these proposals interact with each other.\nThe one exception to this approach is that this analysis does not incorporate the provision to impose a one-time tax, at reduced rates, on the profits that American corporations are officially holding offshore. This proposal, which is sometimes called a “deemed repatriation,” raises revenue during the official 10-year budget window and is technically a tax increase. But this provision is a significant break to many, if not most, American multinational corporations and the revenue raised would be temporary. As another ITEP report explains, this provision would, in the long-run, provide a break of $562 billion to American multinational corporations.[4]\nIn total, this analysis includes the revenue-losing provisions that account for 98 percent of the bill’s gross revenue costs according to JCT. This analysis includes the revenue-raising provisions that account for 93 percent of the gross revenue raised (or 89 percent if the deemed repatriation provision is considered a revenue increase). This analysis is confined to tax revenue and therefore also excludes the effects of repealing the health insurance mandate on direct spending (such as the reduction in Medicaid spending that would result).\nProposed changes affecting individuals are modeled using ITEP’s microsimulation model, which generates tax estimates for a sample of representative taxpayer records from each state.[5] When estimating the impact of corporate tax changes, ITEP uses JCT’s revenue estimates for guidance on a provision’s overall impact and then calculates the distribution of benefits or costs among taxpayers.[6] ITEP follows JCT’s approach in assuming that in the short run, a corporate tax cut will benefit the owners of corporate stocks alone, but in the long run (usually assumed to be ten years after enactment) a quarter of the benefits will flow to workers.[7]\nITEP differs from JCT in that we have updated our approach to account for new research that finds 35 percent of American corporate stocks are owned by foreign investors, a larger fraction than we previously assumed. [8] This means that whatever portion of benefits flows to owners of corporate stocks (100 percent in the short-run, three-fourths in the long-run), one can assume that 35 percent of that amount flows to foreign investors.\nThis approach to corporate tax changes is applied to provisions that entirely affect C corporations (companies that pay the corporate tax), such as the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. For provisions that affect both C corporations and pass-through businesses, this approach is applied to the portion of the provision’s tax cut or tax hike that would fall on C corporations.\nTo estimate the effects of repealing the ACA’s individual mandate to obtain health insurance, we begin with CBO’s estimates of the change in tax revenue that would result from this provision. For example, CBO has estimated that by 2027 repealing the mandate would result in $6 billion less collected from the penalty for not obtaining health insurance (because the penalty would be eliminated) and $28 billion in savings from what CBO calls “changes in subsidies for coverage through marketplace and related spending and revenues.”[9] In another document, CBO breaks down baseline revenue and spending impacts under current law of what it calls “Nongroup Coverage and the Basic Health Program,” which appears to be the same thing and shows that premium tax credits make up 79 percent of that category.[10] This analysis therefore assumes that of the $28 billion in savings that CBO projects for 2027 from changes in subsidies for coverage that would result from repealing the mandate, 79 percent of that amount, or about $22 billion, is a reduction in premium credits paid out that year. To estimate the distribution of these amounts across income groups in each state, this analysis begins with the distribution of penalty payments paid and premium tax credits received in each state in 2015 according to the most recent IRS data.[11] The distribution of the reduction in these amounts under this bill is assumed to be similar, with adjustments for the shift to later years.\nAppendix: State-by-State Figures\nClick to see the distribution for taxes in your state:\n[1] Congressional Budget Office, “Repealing the Individual Health Insurance Mandate: An Updated Estimate,” November 8, 2017. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53300\n[2] Congressional Budget Office, “Repealing the Individual Health Insurance Mandate: An Updated Estimate,” November 8, 2017. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53300\n[3] Joint Committee on Taxation, “Estimated Revenue Effects of the Chairman’s Modification to the Chairman’s Mark of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” Scheduled for Markup by the Committee on Finance on November 15, 2017,” JCX-57-17. https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5038\n[4] Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, “Multinational Corporations Would Receive At Least $458 Billion in Tax Breaks from Congressional Repatriation Proposals,” November 5, 2017. https://itep.org/multinational-corporations-would-receive-over-half-a-trillion-in-tax-breaks-from-the-house-repatriation-proposal/\n[5] ITEP Microsimulation Tax Model Overview. https://itep.org/itep-tax-model\n[6] See note 3.\n[7] Joint Committee on Taxation, “Modeling the Distribution of Taxes on Business Income,” JCX-14-13, October 16, 2013. https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=4528\n[8] Steven M.

While the number of people who fall into the coverage gap has declined as more states implemented the expansion, 1.4 million uninsured individuals remain in the coverage gap in the ten states that have not expanded Medicaid.\nLimited Medicaid eligibility in non-expansion states leaves many adults without children, people of color, and those with disabilities without coverage. Most adults in the coverage gap are in working families, though about one in six have a disability that requires ongoing health care and may limit their ability to work. Using data from 2023, this brief estimates the number and characteristics of uninsured individuals in these ten non-expansion states who could gain coverage if Medicaid expansion were adopted.\nThe future of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion is uncertain as Congress considers significant changes to Medicaid financing. Some proposals under consideration would eliminate the enhanced 90 percent federal matching rate for the expansion population or make other changes to federal payments to states for this group. Any cuts in federal funding for expansion enrollees would likely lead a number of states to rollback coverage for this population and would increase the number of people who fall into the coverage gap and become uninsured.\nHow many people are in the coverage gap?\nThe coverage gap exists in states that have not adopted the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Under the ACA, Medicaid was expanded to cover adults ages 19 to 64 with incomes up to 138% FPL (or $21,597 for an individual in 2025). This income threshold applied to parents and to adults without dependent children who were previously not eligible for Medicaid. While the ACA intended to require all states to implement the Medicaid expansion, a 2012 Supreme Court ruling made expansion optional for states. As of February 2025, 41 states, including the District of Columbia, have adopted Medicaid expansion (Figure 1).\nIn the ten states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion, an estimated 1.4 million individuals remain in the coverage gap. These adults have incomes above their state’s Medicaid eligibility threshold but below the poverty level, making them ineligible for ACA Marketplace subsidies (Figure 2). Because the Medicaid expansion was expected to be mandatory for states, the ACA did not provide eligibility for subsidies in the Marketplaces for people below poverty.\nMedicaid eligibility remains limited in states that have not expanded their programs. All non-expansion states, except Wisconsin (which provides coverage through a waiver), do not offer Medicaid to adults without children, regardless of their income (Figure 3). As a result, 80% of the individuals in the coverage group are adults without dependent children.\nUninsured rates in states without Medicaid expansion are nearly twice as high as those in expansion states (14.1% vs. 7.6%). People without insurance have more difficulty accessing care, with almost one in four uninsured adults in 2023 not receiving needed medical treatment due to cost. Uninsured individuals are also less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and treatment for major health conditions and chronic diseases.\nWhat are the characteristics of people in the coverage gap?\nNearly three-quarters of adults in the coverage gap live in just three Southern states. Texas accounts for 42% of individuals in the coverage gap, the highest share of any state, while Florida and Georgia account for an additional 19% and 14%, respectively (Figure 4). Overall, 97% of those in the coverage gap live in the South. Of the 16 states in the region, seven have not adopted Medicaid expansion.\nNearly six in ten people in the coverage gap are in a family with a worker and over four in ten are working themselves. (Figure 5). However, these individuals work in low-wage jobs that leave them below the poverty level and often work for employers that do not offer affordable job-based insurance. Over half (53%) of workers in the coverage gap are in the service, retail, and construction industries, with common jobs including cashiers, cooks, servers, construction laborers, housekeepers, retail salespeople, and janitors. In non-expansion states, even part-time work can make parents ineligible for Medicaid.\nAbout one in six (16%) people in the coverage gap have a functional disability. The share of people in the coverage gap with disabilities increases with age (Figure 6). Over a quarter (26%) of adults ages 55 to 64 in the coverage gap have a disability compared to one in ten adults under age 25. Adults ages 55 to 64, who often face increased health care needs, account for 17% of all people in the coverage gap. Despite these challenges, many of these individuals do not qualify for Medicaid through a disability pathway, leaving them uninsured. Research shows that uninsured people in this age group may delay necessary care until they become eligible for Medicare at 65.\nPeople of color make up a disproportionate share of individuals in the coverage gap. Six in ten people in the coverage gap are people of color, a higher share than among adults in non-expansion states (49%) and nationwide (44%) (Figure 7). These differences in part explain persisting disparities in health insurance coverage across racial and ethnic groups.\nHow many uninsured could gain coverage if all states adopted the Medicaid expansion?\nApproximately 2.7 million uninsured adults would gain coverage if all states adopted Medicaid expansion. This includes 1.4 million people in the coverage gap and 1.3 million uninsured adults with incomes between 100% and 138% of the FPL, most of whom are eligible for Marketplace coverage but not enrolled (Figure 7 and Table 1). While many of these adults above poverty qualify for zero-premium Marketplace plans, Medicaid generally provides more comprehensive benefits with lower out-of-pocket costs. The potential number of people who could gain coverage through expansion varies by state.\nSammy Cervantes, Clea Bell, and Jennifer Tolbert are with KFF. Anthony Damico is an independent consultant.\nAppendix Tables\nData And Methods\nThis analysis uses data from the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS provides socioeconomic and demographic information for the United States population and specific subpopulations. Importantly, the ACS provides detailed data on families and households, which we use to determine income and household composition for ACA eligibility purposes.\nMedicaid and Marketplaces have different rules about household composition and income for eligibility. The ACS questionnaire captures the relationship between each household resident and one household reference person, but not necessarily each individual to all others. Therefore, prior to estimating eligibility, we implement a series of logical rules based on each person’s relationship to that household reference person in order to estimate the person-to-person relationships of all individuals within a respondent household to one another. We then assess income eligibility for both Medicaid and Marketplace subsidies by grouping individuals into household insurance units (HIUs) and calculate HIU income using the rules for each program. For more detail on how we construct person-to-person relationships, aggregate Medicaid and Marketplace households, and then count income, see the detailed Technical Appendix A.\nUndocumented immigrants are ineligible for federally-funded Medicaid and Marketplace coverage. Since ACS data do not directly indicate whether an immigrant is lawfully present, we draw on the methods underlying the 2013 analysis by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and the recommendations made by Van Hook et. Al.1 ,2 This approach uses the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants to develop a model that predicts immigration status for each person in the sample. We apply the model to ACS, controlling to state-level estimates of total undocumented population as well as the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center. For more detail on the immigration imputation used in this analysis, see the Technical Appendix B.\nIndividuals in tax-filing units with access to an affordable offer of Employer-Sponsored Insurance (ESI) are still potentially MAGI-eligible for Medicaid coverage, but they are ineligible for advance premium tax credits in the Health Insurance Exchanges. Since ACS data do not designate policyholders of employment-based coverage nor indicate whether workers hold an offer of ESI, we developed a model that predicts both the policyholder and the offer of ESI based on the Current Population Survey (CPS). Additionally, for families with a Marketplace eligibility level below 250% FPL, we assume any reported worker offer does not meet affordability requirements and therefore does not disqualify the family from Tax Credit eligibility on the Exchanges. For more detail on the offer imputation used in this analysis, see the Technical Appendix C.\nAs of January 2014, Medicaid financial eligibility for most adults ages 19-64 is based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). To determine whether each individual is eligible for Medicaid, we use each state’s reported eligibility levels as of May 2024, updated to reflect 2025 Federal Poverty Levels. Some adults ages 19-64 with incomes above MAGI levels may be eligible for Medicaid through other pathways; however, we only assess eligibility through the MAGI pathway.3\nAn individual’s income is likely to fluctuate throughout the year, impacting his or her eligibility for Medicaid. Our estimates are based on annual income and thus represent a snapshot of the number of people in the coverage gap at a given point in time. Over the course of the year, a larger number of people are likely to move in and out of the coverage gap as their income fluctuates.\nStarting with our estimates of ACA eligibility in 2017, we transferred our core modeling approach from relying on the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the American Community Survey (ACS). ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates as well as longer trend analyses. Since our methodology excludes a small number of individuals whose poverty status could not be determined, our ACS-based population totals appear slightly below CPS-based totals and some ACS population totals published by the Census Bureau. This difference is in large part attributable to students who reside in college dormitories. Comparing the two survey designs, CPS counts more of these individuals in the household of their parent(s) than ACS does.\nTechnical Appendix A: Household Construction\nIn KFF’s estimates of eligibility for ACA coverage, income eligibility for both Medicaid and Marketplace subsidies is assessed by grouping people into “health insurance units” (HIUs) and calculating HIU income according to Medicaid and Marketplace program rules. HIUs group people according to how they are counted for eligibility for health insurance, versus grouping people according to who they live with (e.g., “households”) or are related to (e.g., “families”). HIU construction is an important step in assessing income as a share of the federal poverty line (FPL) because it impacts whose income is counted (and thus the total income for the unit) and how many people share that income (and thus the corresponding FPL to use for comparison, since FPL varies by family size). Our HIUs are designed to match ACA eligibility rules for both Medicaid and Marketplaces. Below we describe how we construct HIUs for this analysis. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nPerson to Person Relationships\nWe construct spousal and parent-to-child person-to-person linkage variables within each household of the microdata. The American Community Survey (ACS) includes only the relationship of each person in a household to one central reference person. Using the household reference person’s known relationships to all other individuals within each household, we iterate through every pair of individuals present in each household to determine probable person to person links for possible mother, father, and spousal pairs. Our approach to determining probable family interrelationship linkages closely follows the construction documented by IPUMS-USA with the notable exception of unmarried partner relationships.4 We intentionally diverge from IPUMS-USA because the presence of an unmarried partner relationship does not impact federal program eligibility. Among individuals designated as married with a spouse present in the household, our constructed spousal pointer matches the IPUMS SPLOC variable 99% of the time in the 2013 microdata. Our construction of mother and father pointers match the IPUMS MOMLOC, POPLOC, MOMLOC2, and POPLOC2 variables for more than 99% of all person-records.\nFamily Aggregation\nSeparate from person-to-person linkage variables, we assemble individual records into family units reproducing the Census Bureau’s Family Poverty Ratio (POVPIP) variable. Although the Census Bureau does not include a unique family identifier on the ACS microdata, we approximate the groupings used to generate the ACS income-to-poverty ratio variable with the following steps:\n- Both non-relatives of the household reference person (RELP of 11-17) and all individuals in non-family households (HHT of 4-7) are categorized as single-person families.\n- Married couples and other family households without subfamilies (PSF of 0) are categorized into single-family households.\n- Married couples and other family households with subfamilies (PSF of 1) are categorized based on their subfamily number (SFN).\nThis family identifier is used in estimating family-wide statistics, such as the percent of the uninsured Americans in a family below poverty or the count of Medicaid-enrollees with one or more workers in their family. This family aggregation matches the groupings used to determine the income-to-poverty ratio variable, and estimates of health insurance presented by family poverty categories align with Census Bureau publications based on the ACS.5 Since many family members obtain health coverage separately from one another (for example, an elderly parent cohabiting with their working-age child might hold Medicare coverage and Employer Sponsored Insurance, respectively), descriptive statistics focused on family attributes rely on this family identifier but Medicaid and Marketplace eligibility determinations do not.\nOverview of KFF-HIUS\nWe construct two different HIUs for everyone in the sample: a Medicaid HIU and a Marketplace HIU. We use two HIUs because the rules for counting families and income differ between the two programs. For example, in Medicaid, children with unmarried parents have both parents’ income counted toward their income, whereas under Marketplace rules, only the income of the parent who claims the child on his/her taxes counts. In another example, certain tax dependents (e.g., a parent) are treated differently for Medicaid eligibility than they are for Marketplace eligibility. To account for these rules, we developed an algorithm for sorting people into HIUs. We construct HIUs and HIU incomes separately for each person in a household and take into account the family relationships and income of the other people in the person’s household. People in the same household or in the same family may not have the same HIU composition or income for determining either Medicaid eligibility or eligibility for tax credits.\nIn simplest terms, the HIU algorithm sorts people into tax filing units. For all people in the data set, the algorithm assesses whether they are likely to be a tax filer themselves and, if so, who they are likely to claim or, if not, who is likely to claim them. It also captures whether someone is neither a tax filer nor claimed as a dependent by someone else. Importantly, the HIU construction considers all relationships for each person within the household. This step is particularly important in correctly classifying people in non-nuclear families (e.g., households with more than one generation, with unmarried partners, or with relatives outside the nuclear family such as an aunt or uncle), which may contain either one or multiple tax filing units.\nIn counting income for both Medicaid and Marketplace HIUs, we use modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), corresponding to the ACA rules. MAGI differs from total income in that some sources of income (e.g., cash assistance payments from TANF or SSI) do not count toward MAGI. We calculate HIU income as a share of poverty using the Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.6\nFor a small number of people, Medicaid HIU income as a share of poverty does not match Marketplace HIU income as a share of poverty due to the different rules between the programs. This analysis first calculates Medicaid HIU and classifies anyone who meets Medicaid eligibility into that category (including most individuals below 138% FPL in the Medicaid expansion states). We then calculate Marketplace HIU; anyone meeting subsidy eligibility is grouped into that category (above Medicaid and also above 100% FPL up to 400% FPL for most individuals). This approach follows the eligibility rules in the ACA, which specify that people are eligible for tax credits only if they are ineligible for Medicaid.\nSteps in Calculating KFF-HIUS\nBefore we group people into HIUs, we first calculate annual MAGI for each respondent. We compare each person’s income to IRS filing requirements for being a tax filer7 and for being a qualifying relative claimed by someone else.8\nWe then group people into HIUs. We begin this process by grouping everyone within a household who is related into “cohabitating families.” Cohabitating families include all family relations; they also include unmarried cohabitating partners and relatives of each cohabitating partner.\nWithin each cohabitating family, we assess whether any individual is eligible to claim any other individual as a tax dependent. People are eligible to claim others as tax dependents if their income is above the IRS filing threshold for a head of household or, if married, for a married couple. People are eligible to be claimed by others if (a) they are a child (under age 19 or, for tax credits, 23 if a full-time student), and someone else in the cohabitating family has at least twice their income, or (b) they are below the limit to be a tax filer, have income below the qualifying relative limit, and someone else in the cohabitating family has at least twice their income. Within each cohabitating family, we assess who is likely to claim whom, using the assumptions that:\n- People who are claimed by others are more likely to be claimed by close relatives (e.g., a parent) than by others (e.g., a grandparent).\n- Married couples (who file) file jointly\n- If more than one person in a cohabitating family is eligible to claim others within that cohabitating family, the wealthiest person claims the eligible dependents.\nOnce we determine who within the cohabitating family is likely to claim each other, we know the HIU size and are able to apply income rules for the HIU. We apply Medicaid and Marketplace rules for whose income counts in calculating Medicaid HIUs and Marketplace HIUs, respectively.9 People who are filers but are not eligible to claim someone else or to be claimed by someone else are an HIU of 1. People who are not filers and are not claimed by filers have their HIU size and income counted according to Medicaid non-filer rules.10\nInflation Factors\nIn order to determine ACA eligibility during calendar year 2023, we compared tax filing unit income against the most current premiums available, for open enrollment 2025.11 We relied on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (ECI), Private Wages and Salaries to inflate the income of each HIU by approximately 8.0% to align 2023 incomes to 2025 premiums.12 Since most state Medicaid eligibility determinations through the MAGI pathway are calculated as a percent of HHS Poverty Guidelines for that year and not a fixed dollar amount, inflation was not necessary to assess the Medicaid eligibility of individuals.\nAfter inflating 2023 tax filing unit incomes to match 2025 premiums, we similarly inflated 2023 IRS thresholds for both filing requirements13 and for qualifying relative tests14 by the same factor so that these thresholds aligned with the inflated income amounts.\nLimitations\nAs with any analysis, there are some limitations to our approach due to the level of detail that we can obtain from available survey data. Key limitations to bear in mind include:\n- We currently are not able to appropriately group anyone who lives outside the household with a household that claims them as a tax dependent. For example, we are not able to connect students living away from home or children with a non-custodial parent with the people who may be claiming them (and whose income should count to their HIU). We are also not able to determine married people who file separately.\n- To group people into tax filing units, we have to make assumptions about how people are likely to file their taxes. We assume that tax filers claim qualifying relatives they are able to claim. We make this assumption based on the fact that Medicaid and Marketplace eligibility rules are determined not by who is actually claimed on the tax return but by who is allowed to be claimed. However, people may sort themselves into different tax filing units than we estimate.\nTechnical Appendix B: Immigration Status Imputation\nTo impute documentation status, we draw on the methods underlying the 2013 analysis by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and the recommendations made by Van Hook et. al..15 ,16 This approach uses the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants to develop a model that predicts immigration status for each person in the sample.17 We apply the model to a second data source, controlling to state-level estimates of total undocumented population as well as the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center.18 Below we describe how we developed the regression model and applied it to the American Community Survey (ACS). We also describe how the model may be applied to other data sets. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nData Sources\nWe used the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants l data to build the regression model. The 2023 Survey of Immigrants dataset contains questions on citizenship and legal status at the person level. The KFF/LA Time Survey of Immigrants19 is a probability-based survey exploring the immigrant experience in the U.S. and draws on three different sampling frames including an address-based sample (ABS), a random digit dial (RDD) sample of pre-paid cell phone numbers, and callbacks to an RDD sample in which the individual did not speak English or Spanish. The survey includes interviews with 3,358 immigrant adults and was offered in ten different languages.\nThe regression model is designed to be applied to other datasets in order to impute legal immigration status in surveys that do not ask about migration status. The code mentioned above includes programming to apply the model to either the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Core files, ACS, or the Current Population Survey (CPS). Because the SIPP Core file contains different survey questions and variable specifications from the ACS and CPS, we create unique regression models to apply the model to each dataset. For the analysis underlying this brief and other KFF estimates of eligibility for ACA coverage, we apply the regression model to the 2013 ACS and then each subsequent year of the ACS.\nDue to underreporting of legal immigration status in survey datasets, in imputing immigration status we control to state and national-level estimates of the total undocumented population and also the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center. Pew reports these estimates for all states and the District of Columbia.20\nConstruction of Regression Model\nWe use the 2023 Survey of Immigrants to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies a respondent as a potential unauthorized immigrant. The dependent variable is constructed based on the following factors:\n- Respondent was not a United States (US) citizen,\n- Respondent did not have permanent resident status or a valid work or student visa, , and\n- Respondent does not have other indicators that imply legal status.21\nWe use the following independent variables to predict unauthorized immigrant status:\n- Year of US entry,\n- Job industry classification,\n- State of residence,\n- Household Income,\n- Ownership or rental of residence,\n- Number of occupants in the household (< or >= six occupants),\n- Whether all household occupants are related,\n- Health insurance coverage status,\n- Sex, and\n- Ethnicity.\nThe regression model was sub-populated to remove respondents who could not be considered unauthorized. People who could not be considered unauthorized include people who are US citizens or have other indicators that imply legal status.\nImputing Unauthorized Immigrants in Other Datasets\nWe use the Pew estimates as targets for the total number of unauthorized immigrants that the imputation generates. We first apply this strategy to the 2013 ACS, which contains health insurance information prior to the ACA’s coverage expansions. We stratify the targets by state and the District of Columbia and by participation in the labor force. We impute immigration status within each of these 102 strata.22\nTo generate the imputed immigration status variable, we first calculated the probability that each person in the dataset was unauthorized based on the 2023 Survey of Immigrants regression model. Next, we isolated the dataset to each individual stratum described above. Within each stratum, we sampled the data using the probability of being unauthorized for each person. After sampling, we summed the person weights until reaching the Pew population estimate for each stratum. The records that fell within the Pew population estimate were considered to be unauthorized immigrants. We repeated the process of sampling using the probability of being unauthorized and subsequently summing the person weights to reach Pew targets five times, creating five different unauthorized variables per record. These five imputed authorization status variables were then incorporated into a standard multiple imputation algorithm, closely matching the imputed variable analysis techniques used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the National Health Interview Survey.23\nWe used this first pass on the ACS 2013 to inform our sampling targets for the latest available microdata (ACS 2023). Looking at the results of our undocumented imputation on the ACS 2013, we calculated the share of undocumented immigrants lacking health insurance within each of those 102 strata prior to the ACA’s coverage expansions and transferred that information into a new dimension of sampling strata for the ACS 2023. We split each of the 102 sampling strata used on the pre-ACA ACS 2013 into uninsured versus insured categories, resulting in 204 sampling strata for subsequent years. We then repeated our imputation on the ACS 2023 with the newly-divided strata, allowing for a small decline in the undocumented uninsured rate based off of the percent drop in the uninsured rate among citizens.24\nTo easily apply the regression model to other data sets, we created a function that applies this approach to a chosen data set. The function first loads the dataset of choice, then standardizes the data to match the independent variables from the 2023 Survey of Immigrants regression model, and finally applies the multiple imputation to generate a variable for legal immigration status.\nTechnical Appendix C: Imputation Of Offer Of Employer-sponsored Insurance\nAn integral part of determining ACA eligibility is assessing whether workers without employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) hold an offer through their workplace that they decline to take up. In most cases, an affordable offer of ESI disqualifies members of the tax filing unit of the worker from receiving subsidized coverage on the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace. The American Community Survey (ACS) does not ask about employer offers of ESI; however, the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) includes questions about whether each worker received an offer of ESI from his or her employer at the time of interview. We use the CPS-ASEC offer of ESI variable to inform a regression-based multiple imputation of whether each tax filing unit constructed in the ACS had at least one offer at work, and also assess affordability for the employee and, separately, for any potential dependents within the unit. Since the health insurance coverage variables available in the CPS-ASEC 2024 capture sources of coverage at any point during calendar year 2023 (versus at the time of survey, as with the offer rate variable), a subset of sampled individuals had a change in their employer-based coverage status across the two distinct time periods.25 Therefore, among workers who potentially experienced a shift in offer status across the two time periods, we recoded or imputed offer rates in 2023 using the offer status in 2024. After constructing this revised offer variable for workers in CPS, we aggregated the results at the tax filing unit level to create a prediction model to apply to the ACS. Below we describe these recodes and imputation. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nRecoding and Imputing Offer Rate Data in the CPS\nAs a first step in our analysis, we divided CPS-ASEC survey respondents into five distinct groups:\n- All individuals who did not work during 2023 and also did not hold an offer of ESI in 2024 were assumed not to have an offer in 2023.\n- All individuals who reported being an ESI policyholder (that is, anyone reporting having taken-up their offer of ESI) during 2023 and also reported holding an offer of ESI during early 2024 were assumed to have an offer in 2023.\n- All workers in 2023 who held their own ESI policies during 2023 but then reported not holding an offer during 2024 were re-coded as holding an offer of ESI in 2023.\n- All non-workers during 2023 who reported holding an offer during 2024 were re-coded as not holding an offer of ESI in 2023.\n- Some workers during 2023 who did not report being ESI policyholders but did report holding an offer of ESI during early 2024 were imputed to not have an offer of ESI during 2023.\nFor many groups, including those in groups (1) and (2) listed above, the offer status did not change across the two time periods. In contrast, we recoded offer status for people in groups (3) and (4): every non-offered worker in group (3), which includes people who held ESI policies in their own name in 2023, were considered to have an offer of ESI in 2023, and offered workers in group (4), which includes people who did not work themselves in 2023, were considered to not have their offer of ESI in 2023. Last, we implemented a probability-based random sample imputation of offers of ESI for people in group (5), described in more detail below. Only a subset of the group was re-coded from holding an offer in 2024 to not holding an offer in 2023.The number of workers selected from this population was equal to the population size of (3) subtracted by the population size of (4), thereby assuming an unchanging offer rate for the total worker population across the period.\nImputing Offer Rates for CPS Respondents with Ambiguous Offer Rate Status\nThe CPS-ASEC worker-level regression model was designed to be applied to a single dataset where ESI offer status is known at one point in time but not another. The code mentioned above includes programming to apply the model to the Current Population Survey (CPS-ASEC) (for years 2014 on). For the analysis underlying KFF’s current estimates of ACA eligibility, we apply the regression model to workers in the 2024 CPS-ASEC.\nWe use the 2024 point-in-time worker offer variable provided by the US Census Bureau26 to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies a respondent as a recipient of an offer of employer-sponsored insurance at his or her workplace in early 2024. The dependent variable was constructed at the worker-level based on individuals not holding their own ESI policy at time of interview and also reporting an ESI offer or eligibility to be covered that was then voluntarily declined.\nWe use the following independent variables to predict offer status in 2023 among workers not covered by their own ESI during both 2023 and early 2024 but potentially holding an offer of ESI in 2023:\n- Any public coverage,\n- Any nongroup coverage,\n- Worker earnings among all jobs,\n- Full-time versus part-time status,\n- Age of worker,\n- Work within the construction industry.\nThe regression model was sub-populated to remove respondents already covered by their own ESI and also to remove non-workers. Since this imputation does not account for the affordability of the offer or whether it meets the minimum value test, we included an assumption that workers in tax filing units with a MAGI below 250% FPL do not hold affordable offers of ESI and therefore might be eligible to purchase subsidized coverage on the Exchanges.27\nAs mentioned above, we assume an unchanging offer rate for the total worker population across the two time periods. We determined the needed size of the population to impute by subtracting the population of (4) from the population of (3) to ensure an equivalent number of offers were gained and lost. This left only workers who reported holding an offer of ESI during early 2024, since (3) represented a larger count of workers than (4). We then calculated the probability that each worker in the dataset was offered ESI during calendar year 2023 based on our 2024 CPS-ASEC regression model. Next, we selected workers within the potential population (5) using the sampling probabilities resultant from our model.\nConstruction and Application of ACS Regression Model\nFor the analysis underlying KFF estimates of ACA eligibility, we construct a prediction model of having an offer of ESI using the 2024 CPS-ASEC and then apply this regression to tax filing units in the 2023 ACS to estimate who has an ESI offer in ACS.\nWe aggregate the worker offer variables constructed the 2024 CPS-ASEC as described above to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies each tax filing unit as either holding or not holding an affordable offer of employer-sponsored insurance.\nWe use the following independent variables to predict offer status among tax filing units:\n- Any senior citizen in the household,\n- Oldest member of the tax-filing unit,\n- Any member of the tax-filing unit has employer-sponsored insurance coverage,\n- Any member of the tax-filing unit has nongroup coverage,\n- Any uninsured individuals in the tax filing unit,\n- Share of adults working full-time and part-time, and\n- Highest worker earnings.\nSince the imputation of documentation status (discussed in Technical Appendix B) required a multiply-imputed approach, this secondary imputation and subsequent worker sampling was only conducted once per implicate, keeping the number of ACS implicates to five.\nEndnotes\n- State Health Access Data Assistance Center. 2013. “State Estimates of the Low-income Uninsured Not Eligible for the ACA Medicaid Expansion.” Issue Brief #35.

We are unable to assess disability status in the ACS sufficiently to model eligibility under these pathways. However, previous research indicates high current participation rates among individuals with disabilities (largely due to the automatic link between SSI and Medicaid in most states, see Kenney GM, V Lynch, J Haley, and M Huntress. “Variation in Medicaid Eligibility and Participation among Adults: Implications for the Affordable Care Act.” Inquiry. 49:231-53 (Fall 2012)), indicating that there may be a small number of eligible uninsured individuals in this group. Further, many of these pathways (with the exception of SSI, which automatically links an individual to Medicaid in most states) are optional for states, and eligibility in states not implementing the ACA expansion is limited. ↩︎\n- Steven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer, Jose Pacas, and Matthew Sobek.

We allow the undocumented rate to drop slightly after 2013. We base the percent drop in the uninsured rate among the undocumented on the drop for citizens (half the scale of the drop for citizens) each year until 2023, resulting in the final undocumented uninsured rate of 51% in calendar year 2023. Prior to implementing this new sampling dimension, we found unrealistic drops in the uninsured rate of the undocumented population that we largely attributed to our prediction model’s inability to discern this group from legally-present non-citizens, many of whom are eligible for assistance under the ACA’s coverage expansions. Although a few states have implemented programs that allow for coverage of the undocumented population, these programs are state-funded and relatively small in scale compared to the nationwide coverage expansions accompanying the ACA. ↩︎\n- For example, anyone who did not work during 2023 who then held an offer of ESI in early 2024 would appear incongruous in our CPS-based eligibility model. In the other direction, workers covered by health insurance through their own employer in 2023 who lost their offer of ESI during the early months of 2024 (perhaps due to a job change) would also appear incongruous due to the discrepancy across the two time periods. ↩︎\n- Available at: https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/health-insurance/cps-asec-research-files.html.

Gramm’s legislation had broad bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Clinton. Moreover, the bill had nothing to do with causing the crisis, and economists – not to mention President Clinton – praise it for having softened the crisis.\nA McCain-Palin ad, in turn, blames Democrats for the mess. The ad says that the crisis “didn’t have to happen,” because legislation McCain cosponsored would have tightened regulations on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But, the ad says, Obama \"was notably silent\" while Democrats killed the bill. That’s oversimplified. Republicans, who controlled the Senate at the time, did not bring the bill forward for a vote. And it’s unclear how much the legislation would have helped, as McCain signed on just two months before the housing bubble popped.\nIn fact, there’s ample blame to go around. Experts have cited everyone from home buyers to Wall Street, mortgage brokers to Alan Greenspan.\nAnalysis\nAs Congress wrestled with a $700 billion rescue for Wall Street’s financial crisis, partisans on both sides got busy – pointing fingers. MoveOn.org Political Action on Sept. 25 released a 60-second TV ad called \"My Friends’ Mess,\" blaming Sen. John McCain and Republican allies who supported banking deregulation. The McCain-Palin campaign released its own 30-second TV spot Sept. 30, saying \"Obama was notably silent\" while Democrats blocked reforms leaving taxpayers \"on the hook for billions.\" Both ads were to run nationally.\nAnd both ads are far wide of the mark.\n[TET ]\nMoveOn.org Ad: \"My Friends’ Mess\"\nNarrator: We all know the economy is in crisis, but who’s responsible?\nMcCain: My friends. My friends. My friends.\nNarrator: John McCain’s friend Phil Gramm wrote the bill that deregulated the banking industry, and stripped the safeguards that would have protected us. McCain asked Gramm to help write his economic plan. John McCain’s friend Rick Davis lobbied for Fannie and Freddie for years, \"defending\" them against stricter regulation. And now? He runs McCain’s presidential campaign. And John McCain himself? He’s stood by \"deregulation\" time and time again.\nMcCain: I think the deregulation was probably helpful to the growth of our economy.\nNarrator: And now that the markets are in meltdown? John McCain’s friend George Bush wants hardworking Americans to write the biggest blank check in history, bailing out the Wall Street firms and the Washington lobbyists who got us into this mess. Main Street giving Wall Street $700 billion and getting nothing in return? It’s outrageous. Americans shouldn’t have to foot the bill for mistakes that John McCain and his friends made.\nNarrator: MoveOn.org Political Action is responsible for the content of this advertisement.[/TET]\nBlame the Republicans!\nThe MoveOn.org Political Action ad blames a banking deregulation bill sponsored by former Sen. Phil Gramm, a friend and one-time adviser to McCain’s campaign. It claims the bill \"stripped safeguards that would have protected us.\"\nThat claim is bunk. When we contacted MoveOn.org spokesman Trevor Fitzgibbons to ask just what \"safeguards\" the ad was talking about, he came up with not one single example. The only support offered for the ad’s claim is one line in one newspaper article that reported the bill \"is now being blamed\" for the crisis, without saying who is doing the blaming or on what grounds.\nThe bill in question is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which was passed in 1999 and repealed portions of the Glass-Steagall Act, a piece of legislation from the era of the Great Depression that imposed a number of regulations on financial institutions. It’s true that Gramm authored the act, but what became law was a widely accepted bipartisan compromise. The measure passed the House 362 – 57, with 155 Democrats voting for the bill. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 90 – 8. Among the Democrats voting for the bill: Obama’s running mate, Joe Biden. The bill was signed into law by President Clinton, a Democrat. If this bill really had \"stripped the safeguards that would have protected us,\" then both parties share the blame, not just \"John McCain’s friend.\"\nThe truth is, however, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act had little if anything to do with the current crisis. In fact, economists on both sides of the political spectrum have suggested that the act has probably made the crisis less severe than it might otherwise have been.\nLast year the liberal writer Robert Kuttner, in a piece in The American Prospect, argued that \"this old-fashioned panic is a child of deregulation.\" But even he didn’t lay the blame primarily on Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Instead, he described \"serial bouts of financial deregulation\" going back to the 1970s. And he laid blame on policies of the Federal Reserve Board under Alan Greenspan, saying \"the Fed has become the chief enabler of a dangerously speculative economy.\"\nWhat Gramm-Leach-Bliley did was to allow commercial banks to get into investment banking. Commercial banks are the type that accept deposits and make loans such as mortgages; investment banks accept money for investment into stocks and commodities. In 1998, regulators had allowed Citicorp, a commercial bank, to acquire Traveler’s Group, an insurance company that was partly involved in investment banking, to form Citigroup. That was seen as a signal that Glass-Steagall was a dead letter as a practical matter, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley made its repeal formal. But it had little to do with mortgages.\nActually, deregulated banks were not the major culprits in the current debacle. Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan Chase have weathered the financial crisis in reasonably good shape, while Bear Stearns collapsed and Lehman Brothers has entered bankruptcy, to name but two of the investment banks which had remained independent despite the repeal of Glass-Steagall.\nObservers as diverse as former Clinton Treasury official and current Berkeley economist Brad DeLong and George Mason University’s Tyler Cowen, a libertarian, have praised Gramm-Leach-Bliley has having softened the crisis. The deregulation allowed Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase to acquire Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns. And Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have now converted themselves into unified banks to better ride out the storm. That idea is also endorsed by former President Clinton himself, who, in an interview with Maria Bartiromo published in the Sept. 24 issue of Business Week, said he had no regrets about signing the repeal of Glass-Steagall:\nBill Clinton (Sept. 24): Indeed, one of the things that has helped stabilize the current situation as much as it has is the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, which was much smoother than it would have been if I hadn’t signed that bill. …You know, Phil Gramm and I disagreed on a lot of things, but he can’t possibly be wrong about everything. On the Glass-Steagall thing, like I said, if you could demonstrate to me that it was a mistake, I’d be glad to look at the evidence. But I can’t blame [the Republicans]. This wasn’t something they forced me into.\n[TET ]\nMcCain-Palin 2008 Ad: \"Rein\"\nNarrator: John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie.\nThe Post says: McCain \"pushed for stronger regulation\"…\"while Mr. Obama was notably silent.\"\nBut, Democrats blocked the reforms.\nLoans soared. Then, the bubble burst. And, taxpayers are on the hook for billions.\nBill Clinton knows who is responsible.\nClinton: I think the responsibility that the Democrats have may rest more in resisting any efforts by Republicans in the Congress or by me when I was President to put some standards and tighten up a little on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nNarrator: You’re right, Mr. President. It didn’t have to happen.\nMcCain: I’m John McCain and I approve this message. [/TET]\nNo, Blame the Democrats!\nThe McCain-Palin campaign fired back with an ad laying blame on Democrats and Obama. Titled \"Rein,\" it highlights McCain’s 2006 attempt to \"rein in Fannie and Freddie.\" The ad accurately quotes the Washington Post as saying \"Washington failed to rein in\" the two government-sponsored entities, the Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac\"), both of which ran into trouble by underwriting too many risky home mortgages to buyers who have been unable to repay them. The ad then blames Democrats for blocking McCain’s reforms. As evidence, it even offers a snippet of an interview in which former President Clinton agrees that \"the responsibility that the Democrats have\" might lie in resisting his own efforts to \"tighten up a little on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\" We’re then told that the crisis \"didn’t have to happen.\"\nIt’s true that key Democrats opposed the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, which would have established a single, independent regulatory body with jurisdiction over Fannie and Freddie – a move that the Government Accountability Office had recommended in a 2004 report. Current House Banking Committee chairman Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts opposed legislation to reorganize oversight in 2000 (when Clinton was still president), 2003 and 2004, saying of the 2000 legislation that concern about Fannie and Freddie was \"overblown.\" Just last summer, Senate Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd called a Bush proposal for an independent agency to regulate the two entities \"ill-advised.\"\nBut saying that Democrats killed the 2005 bill \"while Mr. Obama was notably silent\" oversimplifies things considerably. The bill made it out of committee in the Senate but was never brought up for consideration. At that time, Republicans had a majority in the Senate and controlled the agenda. Democrats never got the chance to vote against it or to mount a filibuster to block it.\nBy the time McCain signed on to the legislation, it was too late to prevent the crisis anyway. McCain added his name on May 25, 2006, when the housing bubble had already nearly peaked. Standard & Poor’s Case-Schiller Home Price Index, which measures residential housing prices in 20 metropolitan regions and then constructs a composite index for the entire United States, shows that housing prices began falling in July 2006, barely two months later.\n- The Federal Reserve, which slashed interest rates after the dot-com bubble burst, making credit cheap.\n- Home buyers, who took advantage of easy credit to bid up the prices of homes excessively.\n- Congress, which continues to support a mortgage tax deduction that gives consumers a tax incentive to buy more expensive houses.\n- Real estate agents, most of whom work for the sellers rather than the buyers and who earned higher commissions from selling more expensive homes.\n- The Clinton administration, which pushed for less stringent credit and downpayment requirements for working- and middle-class families.\n- Mortgage brokers, who offered less-credit-worthy home buyers subprime, adjustable rate loans with low initial payments, but exploding interest rates.\n- Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who in 2004, near the peak of the housing bubble, encouraged Americans to take out adjustable rate mortgages.\n- Wall Street firms, who paid too little attention to the quality of the risky loans that they bundled into Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), and issued bonds using those securities as collateral.\n- The Bush administration, which failed to provide needed government oversight of the increasingly dicey mortgage-backed securities market.\n- An obscure accounting rule called mark-to-market, which can have the paradoxical result of making assets be worth less on paper than they are in reality during times of panic.\n- Collective delusion, or a belief on the part of all parties that home prices would keep rising forever, no matter how high or how fast they had already gone up.\nThe U.S. economy is enormously complicated. Screwing it up takes a great deal of cooperation. Claiming that a single piece of legislation was responsible for (or could have averted) the crisis is just political grandstanding. We have no advice to offer on how best to solve the financial crisis. But these sorts of partisan caricatures can only make the task more difficult.\n–by Joe Miller and Brooks Jackson\nSources\nBenston, George J.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the conference report to company H.R. 4173, which the clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Conference report to accompany H.R. 4173, to provide for financial regulatory reform, to protect consumers and investors, to enhance Federal understanding of insurance issues, to regulate the over-the-counter derivatives markets, and for other purposes. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. shall be equally divided and controlled by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, or their designees, with the final 20 minutes divided equally between the two managers and the two leaders. The Senator from Hawaii. Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I strongly support the Dodd-Frank conference report. I commend the chairman for all of his work to address so many issues vitally important to working families. I thank my friend from Connecticut for working closely with me to ensure this legislation will educate, protect, and empower consumers and investors. An Office of Financial Education within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is created by the legislation. The office is tasked with developing and implementing initiatives to educate and empower consumers. A strategy to improve financial literacy among consumers, that includes measurable goals and benchmarks, must be developed. The administrator of the bureau will serve as vice-chairman of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission to ensure meaningful participation in Federal efforts intended to help educate, protect, and empower working families. The conference report also addresses investor literacy. A financial literacy study must be conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC. The SEC will be required to develop an investor financial literacy strategy intended to bring about positive behavioral change among investors. Essential consumer and investor protections for working families are included in the conference report. A regulatory structure that will have a greater emphasis on investor and consumer protections is established. Regulators failed to protect consumers and that contributed significantly to the financial crisis. Prospective homebuyers were steered into mortgage products that had risks and costs that they could not understand or afford. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be empowered to restrict predatory financial products and unfair business practices in order to prevent unscrupulous financial services providers from taking advantage of consumers. I take great pride in my contributions to the investor protection portion of the legislation. Section 915 will strengthen the ability of the Securities and Exchange Commission to better represent the interests of retail investors by creating an investor advocate within the SEC. The investor advocate is tasked with assisting retail investors to resolve significant problems with the SEC or the self- regulatory organization, SROs. The investor advocate's mission includes identifying areas where investors would benefit from changes in Commission or SRO policies and problems that investors have with financial service providers and investment products. The investor advocate will recommend policy changes to the Commission and Congress on behalf of investors. The investor advocate is precisely the kind of external check, with independent reporting lines and independently determined compensation, that cannot be provided within the current structure of the SEC. It is not that the SEC does not advocate on behalf of investors, it is that it does not have a structure by which any meaningful self-evaluation can be conducted. This would be an entirely new function. The investor advocate would help to ensure that the interests of retail investors are built into rulemaking proposals from the outset and that agency priorities reflect the issues confronting investors. The investor advocate will act as the chief ombudsman for retail investors and increase transparency and accountability at the SEC. The investor advocate will be best equipped to act in response to feedback from investors and potentially avoid situations such as the mishandling of information that could have exposed ponzi schemes much earlier. We also worked with our colleagues in the other Chamber to include an ombudsman that will be appointed by and report to the investor advocate. I also worked to include in the legislation clarified authority for the SEC to effectively require disclosures prior to the sale of financial products and services. Working families rely on their mutual fund investments and other financial products to pay for their children's education, prepare for retirement, and be better able to attain other financial goals. This provision will ensure that working families have the relevant and useful information they need when they are making decisions that determine their financial future. Unfortunately, too many investors do not know the difference between a broker and an investment advisor. Even fewer are likely to know that their broker has no obligation to act in their best interest. Investment advisors currently have fiduciary obligations. However, brokers must only meet a suitability standard that fails to sufficiently protect investors. In a complicated financial marketplace, for investors in which revenue sharing agreements and commissions can vary significantly for similar products, we must ensure that all investment professionals that offer personalized investment advice have a fiduciary duty imposed on them. In 2005, I first introduced legislation that would have imposed a fiduciary duty on brokers. I knew then that action was necessary. I am proud that a vital investor protection was also included in the conference report that will ensure that a fiduciary duty is imposed on brokers when giving personalized investment advice. This change is necessary because it will ensure that all financial professionals, whether they are an investment advisor or a broker, have the same duty to act in the best interests of their clients. Investors must be able to trust that their broker is acting in their best interest and we must not allow brokers to push higher commission products that may be inappropriate for a particular client. I appreciate all of the efforts of Chairman Frank, Senator Menendez, and Senator Johnson for all of their efforts on this important new investor protection. This legislation also includes landmark consumer protections for remittance transactions. Working families often send substantial portions of their earnings to family members living abroad. In Hawaii, many of my constituents remit money to their family members living in the Philippines. Consumers can have serious problems with their remittance transactions, such as being overcharged or not having their money reach the intended recipient. Remittances are not currently regulated under Federal law, and State [[Page S5871]] laws provide inadequate consumer protections. The conference report modifies the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to establish consumer protections for remittances. It will require simple disclosures about the cost of sending remittances to be provided to the consumer prior to and after the transaction. A complaint and error resolution process for remittance transactions would be established. I appreciate all of the efforts of the chairman, Representative Gutierrez, and the Department of the Treasury for working with me on this important piece of the bill for immigrant communities. This legislation also includes essential economic empowerment opportunities for working families. Title XII, Improving Access to Mainstream Financial Institutions, is the most important economic empowerment provision in the bill. I appreciate the assistance provided by my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl in helping me put this title together. I appreciate the support and contributions made to this title provided Senators Schumer, Brown, Merkley, and Menendez. I grew up in a family that did not have a bank account. My parents kept their money in a box divided into different sections so that money could be separated for various purposes. Church donations were kept in one part. Money for clothes was kept in another and there was a portion of the box reserved for food expenses. When there was no longer any money in the food section, we did not eat. Obviously, money in the box was not earning interest. It was not secure. I know personally the challenges that are presented to families unable to save or borrow when they need small loans to pay for unexpected expenses. Unexpected medical expenses or a car repair bill may require small loans to help working families overcome these obstacles. Mainstream financial institutions are a vital component to economic empowerment. Unbanked or underbanked families need access to credit unions and banks and they need to be able to borrow on affordable terms. Banks and credit unions provide alternatives to high-cost and often predatory fringe financial service providers such as check cashers and payday lenders. Unfortunately, approximately one in four families are unbanked or underbanked. Many of the unbanked and underbanked are low and moderate-income families that cannot afford to have their earnings diminished by reliance on these high-cost and often predatory financial services. Unbanked families are unable to save securely for education expenses, a down payment on a first home, or other future financial needs. Underbanked consumers rely on nontraditional forms of credit that often have extraordinarily high interest rates. Regular checking accounts may be too expensive for some consumers unable to maintain minimum balances or afford monthly fees. Poor credit histories may also limit their ability to open accounts. Cultural differences or language barriers also present challenges that can hinder the ability of consumers to access financial services. I also want to clarify that in section 1204, small dollar-value loans and financial education and counseling relating to conducting transactions in and managing accounts are only examples of, and not limitations on, eligible activities. More must be done to promote product development, outreach, and financial education opportunities intended to empower consumers. Title XII authorizes programs intended to assist low and moderate-income individuals establish bank or credit union accounts and encourage greater use of mainstream financial services. It will also encourage the development of small, affordable loans as an alternative to more costly payday loans. There is a great need for working families to have access to affordable small loans. This legislation would encourage banks and credit unions to develop consumer friendly payday loan alternatives. Consumers who apply for these loans would be provided with financial literacy and educational opportunities. The National Credit Union Administration has provided assistance to develop these small consumer-friendly loans. Windward Community Credit Union in Hawaii implemented a very successful program for the U.S. Marines and other community members in need of affordable short term credit. More working families need access to affordable small loans. This program will encourage mainstream financial service providers to develop affordable small loan products. I thank the Banking Committee staff for all of their extraordinary work, including Levon Bagramian, Julie Chon, Brian Filipowich, Amy Friend, Catherine Galicia, Lynsey Graham Rea, Matthew Green, Marc Jarsulic, Mark Jickling, Deborah Katz, Jonathan Miller, Misha Mintz- Roth, Dean Shahinian, Ed Silverman, and Charles Yi. I also express my appreciation for all of the work done by the legislative assistants of members of the Committee, including Laura Swanson, Kara Stein, Jonah Crane, Ellen Chube, Michael Passante, Lee Drutman, Graham Steele, Alison O'Donnell, Hilary Swab, Harry Stein, Karolina Arias, Nathan Steinwald, Andy Green, Brian Appel, and Matt Pippin. In conclusion, this bill will improve the lives of working families in our country because it will educate, protect, and empower consumers and investors. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and to vote for final passage. First, I congratulate Senator Dodd for the leadership he has shown in marshaling this legislation through some very difficult challenges in the Congress, getting it through the Senate floor, working out the differences between the House and Senate, so we now are on the verge of passing the most significant reform of Wall Street in many years. This bill corrects a regulatory structure that today allows reckless gambling on Wall Street; that creates too big to fail, where government bailouts are necessary to keep companies afloat because there are no other options available to our regulators. It ends reckless gambling on Wall Street. It ends the need for government bailouts of institutions that are too big to fail. It provides for strong consumer protection-- protection for many forms of lending but, most importantly, the residential mortgage market. We saw in this financial crisis that even responsible consumers suffered at the hands of aggressive lenders with dubious intentions. This legislation will create a consumer bureau that will end those types of practices, that will be on the side of the consumer, that is independent, so the consumer is represented in the financial structure. I want to highlight some provisions that were included in this legislation I worked on with our colleagues to get included in the bill. I am very grateful to Senator Dodd, the leadership of the Banking Committee, and our representatives in conference who were able to include provisions that I think add to the importance of this bill. The first provision I want to talk about is a provision I worked on with Senator Enzi and Senator Brownback that will make permanent the federally insured deposit limits from $100,000 to $250,000. We did that recently in order to encourage more deposits, to help our economy, to provide capital for businesses. This limit included in this bill is now made permanent at $250,000. Insured deposits have been the stabilizing force for our Nation's banking system for the past 75 years. They promote public confidence in our banking system and prevent bank runs. They are particularly important to community banks. I know many of us talk about what we can do to help our small businesses, how can we free up more credit to get small businesses the loans they need in order to create the jobs that are needed for our economy. We all know community banks are the most stable source of funds for investments in our communities and small businesses. Community banks rely more on insured deposits than large banks. Madam President, 85 percent to 90 percent of the funds community banks have are included in insured deposits. So this amendment that will make permanent the $250,000 limit will help provide a more steady source of funds for [[Page S5872]] our community banks which will allow them to be able to invest in our communities. Another provision that is included in this conference report is one I worked on with my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, dealing with the enhanced supervision for nonbank financial companies. What we are talking about are mutual funds and their advisers, to make sure they are not inadvertently subjected to unworkable standards. Here we are talking about promoting funds necessary for venture capital and equity investments in our communities, to make sure there is a difference between the type of activities of mutual fund operators who rely primarily on risk investment and those that are primarily involved in insured deposits. I appreciate the conference committee clarifying that provision in the conference report, which Senator Mikulski and I encouraged them to do. Another provision I want to talk about very briefly is one I worked on with Senator Grassley dealing with whistleblower protections at nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, NRSROs as they are known. But I think most people in our country know them as credit rating agencies. These are companies such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's. There are about 10 in our country that are supposed to do independent credit ratings for securities. As I am sure many people are now aware, they played a significant role in the unrealistic confidence in securities during our recent economic downturn. We want to make sure our credit rating agencies, in fact, carry out the responsibilities they are supposed to carry out as independent evaluators. But competition, pressure, and inherent conflicts have made that uncertain. The whistleblower protections that are extended in this legislation will allow employees to come forward with information without fear of retribution by their employer. It is a very important provision, and I am glad it was included in the final legislation. Lastly, let me talk about the extractive industries transparency initiative, an amendment Senator Lugar and I worked very hard on, that is included in the final conference report. I have spoken on the Senate floor previously about this provision, and I particularly thank Senator Leahy for his leadership in the conference on this issue and Senator Dodd for his help in getting it included in the final conference report. Oil, gas, and mining companies registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will be required under this legislation to disclose their payments to governments for access to oil, gas, or minerals. Many of these oil companies or gas companies or mineral companies operate in countries that are autocratic, unstable, or both, and they have to make payments to those countries in order to be able to get access to those mineral rights. This legislation--the amendment that is included in this bill--will require public disclosure of those payments. Why is that so important? And why was it included in the final conference report? First, transparency encourages and provides for more stable governments. We rely on these energy sources or mineral supplies in countries that are of questionable stability. If this disclosure will help make those countries more stable, it provides security for the United States in their supply source, whether it is an energy or mineral supply source. So this amendment that is included in the conference report will help with U.S. energy security. Secondly, investors have a right to know. If you are going to invest in an oil company, you have a right to know where they are doing business, where they are making payments. I would think this is information that may affect your decision as to whether you want to take this risk in investing in that company. So this amendment provides greater disclosure for investors to be able to make intelligent decisions as to whether to invest in an oil or gas or mineral company. Third, as we know, with the lack of transparency, the payments become a source of corruption for government officials in many of these resource-wealthy countries. It is interesting; it is known as the ``resource curse,'' not the ``resource blessing'' in many countries around the world. It is interesting that some of our most wealthy mineral countries are the poorest countries as far as their people in the world. The citizens of these countries are entitled to have their mineral wealth be used to elevate their personal status. By giving the citizens the information about how payments are made to their country, they have a much better chance to hold their government officials accountable. So we not only are protecting investors and helping in energy security, we are helping to alleviate poverty internationally by allowing the people of the countries that have mineral wealth to hold their officials accountable, to use those payments to help the people of that nation. This proposal has been endorsed by the G8, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. With the passage of the conference report, the United States will be the leader internationally on extractive industries transparency, and I think that is a proud moment not only for the Senate but for our Nation. This is a good bill for many reasons. It is a well-organized, commonsense regulatory structure to protect our Nation from another financial crisis, with strong investor and consumer protection, placing limits on institutions deemed too big to fail, protecting not only investors and consumers but also taxpayers. Over the past 30 years, our regulatory framework did not keep pace with financial innovation. It was particularly impotent with regard to oversight of the so-called shadow banking system, which evolved in large part simply to avoid regulation. Decreased regulation led to irresponsible behavior by financiers, investors, lenders, and consumers. Collectively, we failed to mitigate risk and we ignored established principles of finance--prudence, solvency, and accountability. We can shift risk, but we cannot make it magically disappear. Bubbles do burst eventually. Everyone played a part in the crisis. Together, we suffer the consequences. No man is an island; we are all connected. Risky mortgage lending--practices including no-doc or stated income loans--no down payments, and subprime lending led to unprecedented foreclosures. Consumers securing mortgages beyond their means and horrible predatory lending practices permeated our culture. Even responsible consumers suffered at the hands of aggressive lenders with dubious intentions. The mortgage lending system was seriously flawed. America got hit by a tidal wave of foreclosures. Declining home values affect everyone in the community. And problems in mortgage lending became exacerbated when these bad mortgages were packaged into securities and sliced and diced and sold to investors with AAA credit ratings. Careful underwriting went out the window because the loan originators sold the notes as fast as they could write them. The bill the Senate is considering goes a long way to restore the order we need in the financial markets, improve oversight of the mortgage industry, and address the numerous other issues that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. This bill holds Wall Street more accountable and provides the strongest consumer protections ever for American families and small businesses. I know there are partisan disagreements on some parts of this legislation and it was a challenge to get to this point, but the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee did an outstanding job on this bill and are to be commended for their effort. This is a landmark bill, like Sarbanes-Oxley and the original Securities and Exchange Commission Act. The lesson we had to learn, again, is that business--especially big business--cannot regulate itself adequately. I think H.R. 4173 strikes the right balance in reining in the financial services industry without being unduly burdensome. I would like to review some of the provisions I worked on that have been included in the bill. As I have said, Senators Enzi and Brownback joined me in proposing changes to the deposit insurance program. The Independent Community Bankers of America, ICBA, the American Bankers Association, ABA, and [[Page S5873]] the National Credit Union Association, NCUA, all supported our amendment--now found in section 335 of the bill--to make the temporary increase in the federally insured deposit limit from $100,000 to $250,000--a permanent increase. An increase in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, and National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, NCUSIF, limit is significant because deposit insurance has been the stabilizing force of our Nation's banking system for 75 years. By raising the limit permanently, we provide safe and secure depositories for small businesses and individuals alike. FDIC insurance prevents bank runs and has been proven to increase public confidence in the system. FDIC insurance limits are especially significant to community banks, which rely on deposits much more heavily than larger banks. On average, smaller banks derive 85 percent to 90 percent of their funding from deposits. Ensuring a stable funding source for community banks helps these institutions to continue providing crucially important capital to the small businesses whose growth is at the heart of our economic recovery. And as I mentioned earlier, during Senate consideration of the bill, I offered an amendment with Senator Mikulski to ensure that mutual funds and their advisers are not inadvertently subjected to unworkable standards in the unlikely event the Financial Stability Oversight Council designates them as systemically risky. In section 115 of the bill, the new council is given the flexibility to consider capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, size, and other factors when determining heightened regulatory standards. This is important for addressing the unique characteristics of companies that are structured differently from banks and bank holding companies. Further, I am gratified the House and Senate conferees saw fit to retain an amendment, amendment No. 3840, Senator Grassley and I offered to the bill to extend whistleblower protections to employees of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, NRSROs. The provision is section 922(b) of the bill. NRSROs are the companies, such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's, which issue credit ratings that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, permits other financial firms to use for certain regulatory purposes. There are 10 NRSROs at present, including some privately held firms. The NRSROs played a large role--by overestimating the safety of residential mortgage-backed securities, RMBS, and collateralized debt obligations, CDOs--in creating the housing bubble and making it bigger. Then, by making tardy but massive simultaneous downgrades of these securities, they contributed to the collapse of the subprime secondary market and the ``fire sale'' of assets, exacerbating the financial crisis. A Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, PSI, hearing made it quite clear that competitive pressures and inherent conflicts of interest affected the objectivity of the ratings issued by the NRSROs. Since NRSRO ratings are used for various regulatory purposes, such as determining net capital requirements and the soundness of insurance company reserves, it makes sense to extend whistleblower protections to employees who might come across malfeasance at a credit rating agency. There are many reasons for the massive failure of the NRSROs. The Wall Street reform bill contains several provisions to improve SEC and congressional oversight of the NRSROs and how they function. Extending whistleblower status to the employees of these firms enhances the provisions already in the underlying bill. As I have also said, my distinguished colleague, Senator Lugar, and I worked particularly hard on the energy security through transparency provision in this bill, which is section 1504--Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers. I am especially grateful to Senator Leahy, who championed this provision in the conference committee. The geography and nature of the oil, gas, and mining industry is such that companies often have to operate in countries that are autocratic, unstable, or both. Investors need to know the full extent of a company's exposure when it operates in countries where it is subject to expropriation, political and social turmoil, and reputational risks. In Nigeria, for example, American companies have had to take oil fields offline because of rebel activity and instability in the Niger Delta. Last year, Nigeria was producing almost a million barrels of oil less than it was able to produce because of conflict and instability. With so much production offline, American oil companies such as Chevron and Exxon have laid off workers and paid higher production costs because of added security. This bipartisan amendment goes a long way to achieving transparency in this critical sector by requiring all foreign and domestic companies registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, to include in their annual report to the SEC how much they pay each government for access to its oil, gas, and minerals. This amendment is a critical part of the increased transparency and good governance that we are striving to achieve in the financial industry. Our amendment is vitally important. Transparency helps create more stable governments, which in turn allows U.S. companies to operate more freely--and on a level playing field--in markets that are otherwise too risky or unstable. Let me point out three key results we expect from this provision: No. 1, enhancing U.S. energy security. The reliability of oil and gas supplies is undermined by the instability caused when local populations do not receive the benefit of their resource exports. Enhancing openness in revenue flows allows for greater public scrutiny of how revenues are used. Increased transparency can help create more stable, democratic governments, as well as more reliable energy suppliers. No. 2, strengthening energy markets. The extractive industries are capital-intensive and dependent on long-term stability to generate favorable returns. Leading energy companies recognize that more transparent investment climates are better for their bottom lines. No. 3, helping to alleviate poverty. Too many resource-rich countries that should be well off are home to many of the world's poor instead. This is a phenomenon known as the ``resource curse.'' Oil, gas reserves, and minerals don't automatically confer wealth on the people who live in countries where those resources are located. Many resource- rich countries rank at the bottom of most measures of human development, making them a breeding ground for poverty and instability. Revenue transparency will help the citizens of resource-rich countries hold their governments more accountable and ensure that their country's natural resource wealth is used wisely for the benefit of the entire nation and for future generations. The wave of the future is transparency, and these principles of transparency have been endorsed by the G8, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and a number of regional development banks. It is clear to the financial leaders of the world that transparency in natural resource development is vital to holding the rulers in these countries accountable for the needs of their citizens and preventing them from simply building up their personal offshore bank accounts. I am proud to stand here today and say that the United States is now the leader in creating a new standard for revenue transparency in the extractive industries. These are some of the provisions I worked on, but they are a small part of the overall bill, which is very strong. Forty years ago, conservative economist Milton Friedman wrote a New York Times Magazine article entitled ``The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits.'' In this article, quoting from his earlier book ``Capitalism and Freedom,'' from 1962, he concluded: There is one and only one social responsibility of business--to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud. Even this minimalist position suggests that markets need rules. And yet we embarked on a 30-year path to deregulate financial services, to ease the rules, and remove the watchdogs. We have learned a bitter lesson that markets are not self-correcting--at least [[Page S5874]] not without catastrophic consequences. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, their savings, their homes, and their retirement security. Businesses have been wiped out. We have gone from easy credit to no credit. Now that the financial hurricane has wreaked its devastation, it is time to rebuild. H.R. 4173 is part of that process. The bill creates well-organized, commonsense regulatory structures to protect our Nation from another financial crisis. Chairman Dodd and Chairman Frank have produced a bill that addresses the feasibility of our reliance on credit rating agencies, our appetite for systemic risk, and the need to limit the regulatory burden on our small institutions. They have produced a bill that provides strong investor and consumer protections, encourages whistleblowers, reduces interchange fees for small businesses, and places limits on institutions deemed too big to fail. I know that Maryland banks and investment companies appreciate the attention paid in this bill to their concerns regarding bank and thrift oversight, systemic risk regulation, and the effects of the mortgage crisis. While Members of Congress may not agree on every aspect of this bill, it is worthy of our support. Indeed, given the stakes, it is imperative that we pass H.R. 4173. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and support passage. Madam President, I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 4173. I think it is interesting to note we have had a number of speakers who are proponents of this legislation come forward--just as my good friend from Maryland just did--and say we are going to be the leader, the United States is going to be the leader in the financial world market with these changes. Well, the fact is, other countries that have strong financial markets have said publicly just the opposite. What I am afraid we are setting ourselves up for, and what I talked about a lot during the course of the debate on the Senate floor relative to this bill, is that what we are going to wind up doing is we are going to be driving jobs and business overseas with this massive piece of legislation that truly does not address the problem. There is nothing in these 2,300 pages that deals with the primary catalyst of the market instability in our economy--the bailout behemoths, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill simply ignores the devastating impact these two entities continue to have not only on our capital markets but also on our Nation's deficit, already demanding over $145 billion in taxpayer assistance, and with no end in sight as to what it is ultimately going to cost the taxpayers of this country. The newly created consumer protection bureau is an affirmation that the proponents of the legislation have acknowledged government failures were a significant cause of our economic turmoil. But they still believe bigger government is the solution going forward, and despite failure after failure among various regulatory agencies, a new agency is the answer to these shortcomings, and this time it is going to be different. Instead of addressing the problems of the consumer protections in place under our current regulatory structure, this new oversight agency is an added layer of bureaucracy with the authority to examine and enforce new regulations for not only all mortgage-related businesses, but also small mom-and-pop businesses on Main Street such as payday lenders, check cashers, and other nonfinancial firms. These types of entities were clearly not the cause of the economic crisis, yet they will now be subject to the same regulations as the large financial institutions on Wall Street. This is simply another example of the majority party's preference for a one-size-fits-all regulatory structure, stifling economic growth. Having participated in the conference committee, I unfortunately witnessed firsthand the complete disregard for addressing the real issues at hand. As ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, I have spent a great deal of time understanding the over-the-counter derivatives market--its complexities, and its legitimate utility. I have found that both Republicans and Democrats generally agree on the major issues relating to derivatives regulation. We all generally agree there needs to be greater transparency, registration, more clearing, and compliance with a whole host of business conduct and efficient market operation regulations. This is important, because it is a 180- degree shift away from current law where over-the-counter swaps are essentially unregulated today. Within this general agreement that swaps need to go from unregulated to fully regulated, we have had disagreements about who should be required to clear their transactions and how best to require swaps to be transacted and reported. These disagreements are significant because they involve real burdens and duties which will result in real costs to businesses and consumers. I wish to make sure our new regulations are targeted to serve a useful purpose. Unfortunately, this legislation will enable regulators to impose restrictions on businesses that had absolutely nothing to do with creating the financial crisis. Every industry in the country uses derivatives to manage their business risks and many of them will now be forced to clear their derivative transactions. This seems simple enough, until you realize that clearing does not make risk within the financial system disappear. Risk is simply transferred from the individual counterparties to the clearinghouses, a service provided at considerable expense in the form of margin posted to the clearinghouse. So this bill will not eliminate risk, but it simply transfers risk from one place to another and imposes costs on market participants who had nothing to do with creating the financial crisis. I truly fear that consumers will ultimately pay the price. For example, this legislation would force the farm credit system institutions to run their interest rate swaps through a clearinghouse which will result in additional costs in the form of higher interest rates to their customers without doing anything to lessen the systemic risk. Let me be clear as to who this will ultimately affect. It is very clear that our farmers and ranchers, our electric cooperatives, and our ethanol facilities which seek financing from these institutions will bear this burden. Institutions such as Cobank will be forced to clear their swaps and execute them on a trading facility which will impose significant new costs and result in higher rates for their customer, or, worse, discourage them from managing their risk which will again result in higher costs for their borrowers. And why? Because this legislation broadly applies regulation, treating all financial institutions the same. Cobank and Goldman Sachs are not the same and should not be regulated in the same manner. Cobank should have the option to clear their swaps, not be mandated to do so. While the conference report provides an exemption for some businesses from this derivative clearing mandate, it also imposes new margin requirements on derivative dealers for these same uncleared transactions. Who will likely pay for these new margin requirements in the form of higher fees? Again, it is pretty clear the public and private companies across the Nation that had nothing to do with the financial crisis and that are simply seeking to minimize risk will bear this burden. The entire point of exempting some of them from the clearing mandate was to ensure that they do not bear the burden of increased margin costs, but this language would indirectly subject these businesses to the expense of margins imposed on their dealer counterparties--counterparties that will be forced to recoup this cost in the form of fees, and businesses will be forced to pass their costs on to consumers. I encourage all Members of this body to look at yesterday's Wall Street Journal. There is a front-page story on derivatives. When we come to the floor and start debating derivatives, most people's eyes glaze over because it is complex and an issue that is very difficult to understand. But in that article it explains the simplicity that the derivatives world imparts itself in. The article goes through a process of a farmer in Nebraska and his use of derivatives; then his ultimate purchaser of his product--the rancher--and how that rancher uses derivatives to eliminate risk and hopefully guarantee a profit in his business. Then it describes [[Page S5875]] how the slaughterhouse takes the product from the livestock operator, the market operator, and uses derivatives in their business; and then ultimately the guy who owns the trucking company and how he uses derivatives. It is very clear in this article that these guys' lives are going to change from a business perspective. They are not going to be able to use derivatives in the way they used them before. They had nothing to do with the financial crisis that developed in this country. Also related to derivatives were considerable improvements made to the so-called ``swap desk push out'' provision. I commend the chairman for his work on that. Banks would be able to continue to engage in interest rate and foreign currency swaps which is essential to the business of banks. However, I remain concerned that forcing swap dealer banks to spin off their commodity trading will hurt those utilities and airlines wishing to hedge their energy risks in the immediate future. They will be forced to establish new credit ratings and standings with these affiliates rather than take advantage of their longstanding relationship with their current bank. I fail to understand why forcing these entities to spin off any aspect of their swap business is necessary. I wholeheartedly support efforts to make the swaps market more transparent. It needs to be. I believe this will be accomplished once regulators have access to the data which has to date been completely unavailable to them. The public will benefit from knowing who is participating in these markets, and we will finally have the data we need to make informed policy decisions related to derivatives. Our economy needs more opportunities for all businesses to grow and prosper. Time and again, it is the small- and medium-sized businesses that create the lion's share of jobs after a major economic recession. We need to foster and incubate these small- and medium-sized businesses right now and not hamper them. We need to ensure they are able to access capital and manage their risk through the use of derivatives. Right now, there are a lot of these small- and medium-sized companies that are ready to expand but cannot get adequate access to capital because lenders are saying it is too risky and regulators won't allow these lenders to help. So I believe there is a need to respond to what went wrong in our financial system and I support doing so in a responsible way that will continue to allow Main Street businesses to manage their risk appropriately, hold those responsible for this mess accountable, and not create huge new government bureaucracies. Unfortunately, this legislation falls short of these goals. I am pleased the chairman of the Banking Committee is here, because I do want to say publicly--and I have told him this privately and I will continue to say it--that he had a very difficult job, and while we disagreed on a lot of major issues, he was always open for discussion. He allowed participation on the floor as well as discussions off the floor, and for that I thank him. He knows that I obviously cannot vote for this bill, but he has proven himself to be a very valued Member of the Senate by the way he has conducted himself throughout this whole process, and for that I thank him. I yield the floor. Mr. DODD. Madam President, before my colleague leaves the floor, let me thank him as well. Of course, hope always springs eternal. The vote hasn't occurred yet, so we never know. We might get his vote yet. I don't serve on the Agriculture Committee with him. Senator Chambliss was a very valued member of this conference. Obviously, a lot of work took place in the Agriculture Committee dealing with areas of the bill that he has spent several minutes talking about. He raises very good points. I would be the last person to suggest as a coauthor of the bill that we have crafted the perfect piece of legislation. As he points out, these are highly complicated areas. One of the reasons we tried not to write a series of regulations far beyond the competency of those of us in this Chamber is because it is complicated. Obviously, we have delegated the ultimate responsibility that we now have, which is to watch, the oversight, to the regulatory community, to make sure they do this right. I pointed out yesterday, and he has pointed out again today, when we get into a situation such as this crisis, certain words become pejorative, and ``derivatives'' unfortunately has become that, and it shouldn't. These are very critical components for capital formation, job growth, and wealth in our country. Hedging against risk is absolutely essential. So they are vitally important elements in our economy. I hope people, when they hear the word ``derivative'' being spoken won't assume this is somehow a bad idea. One almost gets the sense that people feel that way. I don't at all. I look forward in the coming weeks and months, as regulators begin to work with this bill if, in fact, it passes, that we will do that. A lot of the record has been established in this area, and through no small measure due to the Senator from Georgia, and I thank him for his work as well. Madam President, I yield the floor. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum, and I ask that the time be equally divided on both sides. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today to offer some remarks on the Dodd-Frank regulation conference report, which is now before the Senate. Nearly 2 years ago, the financial crisis exposed massive deficiencies in the structure and culture of our financial regulatory system. Years of technological advances, product development, and the advent of global capital markets rendered the system ill-suited to achieve its mission in the modern economy. Decades of insulation from accountability distracted regulators from focusing on that mission. Instead of acting to preserve safe and sound markets, the regulators primarily became focused on expanding the scope of their bureaucratic reach. After the crisis, which cost trillions of dollars and millions of jobs, it was clear that significant reform was necessary. Despite broad agreement on the need for reform, the majority decided it would rather move forward with a partisan bill. The result is the 2,300-page legislative monster before us that expands the scope and the power of ineffective bureaucracies. It creates vast new bureaucracies with little accountability and seriously undermines the competitiveness of the American economy. Unfortunately, the bill does very little to make our financial system safer. Therefore, I will oppose the Dodd-Frank bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. This was not a preordained outcome; it is the direct result of decisions made by the Obama administration. Had they sincerely wanted to produce a bipartisan bill, I have no doubt we could have crafted a strong bill that would garner 80 or more votes in the Senate. If the American people haven't noticed by now, that is not how things work under the Democratic rule. Unfortunately, the partisan manner in which this bill was constructed is not its greatest shortcoming. One would have assumed that the scope of the crisis--trillions of dollars lost and millions of jobs eliminated--would have compelled the Banking Committee to spend the time necessary to thoroughly examine the crisis and develop the best possible legislation in response. Unfortunately, such an assumption would be entirely unfounded. The Banking Committee never produced a single report on or conducted an investigation into any aspect of the financial crisis. In contrast, during the Great Depression, the Banking Committee set up an entire subcommittee to examine what regulatory reforms were needed. The Pecora Commission, as it came to be known, interviewed, under oath, the big actors on Wall Street and produced a multivolume report. Unfortunately, this time around, the Democratic-run committee gave Wall Street executives a pass, I believe. There were no investigations, no depositions, and no subpoenas. In fact, Chairman Dodd, my friend and colleague, never called on the likes of [[Page S5876]] Robert Rubin and Lloyd Blankfein to testify before the Banking Committee. Not a single individual from AIG's financial products division was questioned by the committee or its staff. Although Congress did establish the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to do the work that the majority party, I believe, refused to do, the Commission's work will not be completed until the end of this year. Most amazingly, the Banking Committee didn't even hold a single hearing on the final bill before its markup. The committee never took the time to receive public testimony or survey experts about the likely outcomes the legislation would produce. We know the majority heard from Wall Street lobbyists, government regulators, and liberal activists, but they clearly decided they did not want the American people to have a chance to understand and comment on the bill before us today before it was enacted. The question is, Why? The majority knows that this bill is a job killer and will saddle Americans with billions of dollars in hidden taxes and fees. Allowing the public to weigh in on this bill would have spelled the end of the Democratic version of reform. I believe we owed more to those who lost their jobs, their homes, and their life savings. I believe this truly was a missed opportunity. The difference between what we needed to do, what we could have done, and what the majority has chosen to do is considerable. I will speak on this. Congress could have focused this legislation on financial stability. It could have utilized the findings of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. Instead, the Democratic majority chose to adopt legislative language penned by Federal regulators in search of expanded turf. They chose to legislate for the political favor of community organizing groups and liberal activists seeking expansive new bureaucracies that they could leverage for their own political advantage. The result is an activist bill that has little to do with the recent or any crisis and a lot to do with expanding the government to satisfy special interests. Congress could have written a bill to address the problem of too big to fail once and for all. In fact, the Shelby-Dodd amendment began to address this problem right here on the floor. Unfortunately, the Democrats once again overreached at the eleventh hour and undermined the seriousness of our effort by emphasizing social activism over financial stability. Democrats insisted that the overall financial stability mission of the Financial Stability Oversight Council was less important than the political needs of certain preferred constituencies. This dangerous mixing of social activism and financial stability follows the exact same model that led us to the crisis in the first place; that is, private enterprise co-opted through political mandates to achieve social goals. Fannie and Freddie proved this combination can be highly destructive. Congress could have written legislation to address key issues known to have played a key role in the recent crisis. On the government- sponsored enterprises, Fannie and Freddie, the bill is silent, aside from a mere study. On the triparty repo market, the bill is silent. On runs in money markets, the bill is silent. On the reliance of market participants on short-term commercial paper funding, the bill is silent. On maturity transformations that allowed the shadow banking system to effectively create money out of AAA-rated securities, thereby making the system much more vulnerable, the bill is silent. On the financial system's overall vulnerability to liquidity crises, the bill again is silent. We know with certainty that all of these factors--none of which is addressed in the bill--were integral to the recent financial crisis. While we don't want to write legislation that only deals with the last crisis, we do want to enact a law that addresses what we know were systemic problems. This bill fails to do so. Congress could have written a bill to streamline regulation and eliminate the gaps that firms exploit in a race to the regulatory bottom. This bill does the opposite by making our financial regulatory system even more complex. We will still have the Fed, FDIC, SEC, CFTC, OCC, and the remainder of the regulatory alphabet soup. In fact, most of the existing regulators that so recently failed us have been given expanded power and scope. This bill will also add new letters to the already-confused soup, such as the CFPB and the OFR. In addition to increased regulatory complexity, there will be new special activist offices within each regulator for almost every imaginable special interest. Congress could have set up reasonable new research capabilities in its new Stability Oversight Council to complement financial research performed by the Federal Reserve and others. Instead, the Democrats decided to establish the Office of Financial Research with an unconstrained director and a focus on broad information collecting and processing. I believe this office will not only fail to detect systemic threats in the asset price bubbles in the future, it will threaten civil liberties and the privacy of Americans, waste billions of dollars of taxpayer resources, and lull markets into the false belief that this new government power will protect the financial system from risky trades. Congress could have been transparent in identifying the bill's fiscal effects and costs. Instead, the majority wrote a bill that hijacks taxpayer resources but hides that fact from public view. Just as the administration refuses to acknowledge trillions of dollars of contingent taxpayer liabilities residing with Fannie and Freddie, this bill refuses to provide Americans with a transparent view of the costs of the new multibillion-dollar consumer protection bureaucracy. According to the report on the bill offered by the majority, the consumer bureaucracy's budget is ``paid for by the Federal Reserve System.'' Make no mistake, ``paid for by the Fed'' means paid for ultimately by the taxpayers. Taxpayers will be on the hook for billions of dollars of unchecked, unencumbered, and unappropriated spending financed by the inflationary money printing authority of the Federal Reserve which will be hidden from the American people in the arcane Federal budget. Congress could have also used this legislative opportunity to begin the process of reforming the failed mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie, whose ever growing bailouts have no upper limit. When it became clear that this was not the intention of the Democrats, Republicans sought to address the current and worsening conditions of the GSEs. We suggested establishing taxpayer protections, such as portfolio caps, on the mortgage giants. We recommended making the cost of Freddie and Fannie bailouts transparent to the public; that is, to the taxpayer. We offered initial steps toward the inevitable unwinding of these failed institutions. Yet at every turn, the Democratic majority blocked Republican efforts to establish at least a foundation for reform. The Democratic-preferred approach in this bill to reforming the mortgage giants is a study. Let me repeat that notion. In order to address a bailout that has already cost American taxpayers roughly $150 billion to date, with unlimited future taxpayer exposure, the Democrats propose a study. It does not take a study to determine that $150 billion in unlimited loss exposure needs to be addressed immediately-- now. Congress could have focused on securities market practices that were known to have contributed to systemic risks in our financial system. Instead, Democrats overreached once again. For example, the bill gives the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has failed to carry out its existing mandates, a new systemic risk mandate to oversee advisers to hedge funds and private equity funds. Yet no one contends private funds were a cause of the recent crisis or that the demise of any private fund during the crisis resulted in a systemwide shock. Congress could have acted to curtail Wall Street's speculative excesses and enhance Main Street's access to credit. But instead, in this bill large financial firms on Wall Street seem to have benefited, judging by the behavior of the stock prices, while the legislation almost surely will increase uncertainties and costs for Main Street and America's job creators. The actual provisions in the bill will benefit big Wall Street institutions because they substantially increase the amount and cost of financial regulation. Only large financial institutions will have the resources to navigate all [[Page S5877]] of the new laws and regulations that this legislation will generate. As a result, this bill, disproportionately will hurt small and medium- sized banks which had nothing to do with the crisis. While the largest financial institutions will get special regulation under this bill, the unintended result will be lower funding costs for these firms. That will benefit the big banks and hurt the small banks. Therefore, this bill will result in higher fees, less choice, and fewer opportunities to responsibly obtain credit for blameless consumers. Moreover, this bill raises taxes which, as we all know, are ultimately borne by consumers. Make no mistake, when Wall Street writes a check to pay its higher taxes, the ones who end up paying those taxes are American consumers and workers. Congress could have written legislation for consumer protection that respects both American consumers and the need for safety and soundness in our financial system. Instead, the Dodd-Frank bill was basically constructed by architects in the Treasury Department who have a certain condescension for American consumers and their choices. The ultimate goal is to substitute the judgment of a benevolent bureaucrat for that of the American consumer, thereby controlling consumer behavior without regard for the safety and soundness of our banking system. The American people are being told not to worry, however, because it is all being done for their own good. While a consumer protection agency might sound like a good idea, the way it is constructed in this bill will slow economic growth and kill jobs by imposing massive new regulatory burdens on businesses, large and small. It will stifle innovation in consumer financial products, and it will reduce small business activity. It will lead to reduced consumer credit and higher costs for available credit. Less credit at higher price will dampen the very small business engines of job creation that our economy desperately needs right now. That is a price I am not willing to pay. Congress could have implemented reforms to improve derivatives market activities. Instead, the bill's derivatives title seems to be inspired by a desire to be punitive or to provide short-term political support during an election, or both. Instead of imposing a rational and effective regulatory framework on the OTC derivatives market, the bill runs roughshod over the Main Street businesses that use derivatives to protect themselves every day. The Dodd-Frank bill will increase companies' costs and limit their access to risk-mitigating derivatives without making our financial system safer in the process. As a result, there will be fewer opportunities for businesses to grow, fewer jobs for the unemployed, and higher prices for consumers. Congress could have written a bill to put an end to overreliance on credit agencies and underreliance on their own due diligence. Instead, the Dodd-Frank bill sets up new regulations and liability provisions to give the impression that ratings are accurate. It then takes a contradictory direction and instructs regulators to replace references to ratings with other standards of creditworthiness. To make matters even more confusing, the bill also provides for the establishment of a government-sponsored body that will select a credit rating agency to perform an initial rating of a security issue. I anticipate the net effect of these conflicting provisions will be a reduction of competition among credit rating agencies. Potential competitors either will be deterred by all of the new regulatory requirements or be destroyed by the liability provisions set up in the bill. The lack of competition led to poor quality ratings in the runup to the crisis. This bill perpetuates and, in fact, worsens that problem. Congress could have eased regulatory burdens on small and medium- sized businesses not integral to the recent crisis or any crisis. Instead, Main Street corporations will be subject to a panoply of new corporate governance and executive compensation requirements. These new requirements will be costly and potentially harmful to shareholders because they empower special interests and encourage short-term thinking by managers. These features were included solely for the purpose of appeasing unions and other special interest lobbyists, and there is no demonstrated link between these changes and the enhanced stability of our financial system or improved investor protection. We are getting toward the end. Congress could have held hearings or analyzed a number of changes this bill makes to the securities laws. Instead, dramatic changes in those laws were written with little discussion and no analysis. Throughout this process, there has been a lot of talk about the influence of Wall Street over this bill. To be sure, in the early stages of the negotiations, Wall Street and the big banks were very engaged. I think the American people know, however, that in the end, the real influence peddlers on this bill were not Wall Street lobbyists but rather liberal activists and Washington bureaucrats. Wall Street and the big banks just happen to be the incidental beneficiaries of their success. When Chairman Dodd and I began this process, we agreed that the bureaucratic status quo was unacceptable and that radical change was necessary. With that in mind, we agreed to consolidate all the financial regulators and constrain the Fed to its monetary policy role. This was not a result the big banks wanted. The last thing a large regulated financial institution wants is a new regulator. After all, they spent years and millions of dollars developing a relationship with our current regulators. A major regulatory reorganization would seriously upset the status quo and cost them a great deal of money. Neither Chairman Dodd nor I were persuaded, however. Change was necessary and change was going to come. Unfortunately, that vision of reform began to die as the bureaucrats and the liberal left began to exercise their influence over the bill. When it became apparent that I was not willing to embrace the left's expansive consumer bureaucracy, it also became apparent that actual regulatory reform was not what the majority was seeking. All other serious reform was scuttled by the Democrats in defense of the new consumer bureaucracy. That was the point at which Chairman Dodd and I began to seek a new negotiating partner, ultimately to no avail. As the Fed and the other regulators began to regain their foothold with the Democrats and the administration and the activist left consolidated its support around an expansive new bureaucracy, all the Democrats will succeed in doing, with the help of a few Republicans, is give the failed bureaucracies more power, more money, and a pat on the back with the hope they will do a better job next time. That is not real reform. That is just more of the same. We had an opportunity to lead the world by creating a modern, efficient, and competitive regulatory structure that will serve our economy for years to come. Instead, I believe we squandered that opportunity by barely expanding our obsolete, inefficient, and uncompetitive system. To make it even worse, they have added to the bureaucratic morass several more unrestrained and unaccountable agencies. It became apparent early on to me that the administration and the Democratic majority were not interested in regulatory reform. All they were trying to do is exploit the crisis in order to expand government further and reward special interests. The Dodd-Frank bill will not enhance systemic stability. It will not prevent future bailouts of politically favored institutions and groups by the government. The bill serves only to expand the Federal bureaucracy and the government control of the private sector. It will impose large costs on the taxpayers and businesses. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Alabama. Once again--I say this with the respect--I feel as if I am listening to the first speech back in November when I offered the original proposal of this bill and wonder if we have been in the same [[Page S5878]] Chamber and same city over the last several years. I am not going to use the time between now and 11 a.m. when we are going to vote on the cloture motion. I will not go through the long list, page after page of amendments that were adopted as part of this bill offered by my good friends on the minority side. We had 80 hearings held over 2 years, with countless efforts to reach out and bring in people. One can make a lot of accusations about the bill, but this was a very inclusive process. Half the amendments adopted on the floor in this Chamber during consideration of this legislation over 4 weeks were ones offered by the minority and were accepted and bipartisan amendments. There was never an alternative offered. There was never a substitute offered. It was a question of whether people wanted to amend this legislation. It is not a perfect bill, I will be the first to admit. We do not know ultimately how well the ideas we incorporated will achieve the results we all desire. It will take the next economic crisis--as certainly it will come--to determine whether the provisions of this bill will provide this generation or the next generation of regulators with the tools necessary to minimize the effects of that crisis when it happens. But we believe we have done the best we could under the circumstances to see to it we never have another bailout of another major financial institution at taxpayer expense. In fact, it was the Shelby-Dodd amendment adopted in this Chamber--it was the second amendment we considered--that actually completed the process of seeing to it there would be bankruptcy or resolution of financial institutions that got themselves into so much trouble that they put the entire system at risk. We set up an oversight council to make sure we could observe what was occurring not only here at home but around the globe--matters such as Greece or Spain that could put our economy at risk. So it isn't just one set of eyes but having those responsible for seeing to it that our economy remains safe and sound have the opportunity to provide the early warning that never occurred. We didn't need a Pecora Commission to find out what was going wrong. We had mortgages being sold in this country to people who couldn't afford them, marketing them in a way that guaranteed failure, securitizing them so they could be paid and then skipping town in a sense. I didn't need to have hours of hearings to find out what was the cause of it. The question was, How do we try to put a system in place to minimize the future kind of risks our Nation would face. It wasn't just to deal with those who created the problem but, rather, to look ahead--not in a punitive way--and to set up an architecture and structure to allow us to get to that point where we could be confident we were addressing these issues. Thirdly, of course, we tried to deal with exotic instruments that had caused so much of the difficulty. The derivatives market was a $90 billion market, and it mushroomed in less than a decade to $600 trillion, putting our Nation at risk because of a lack of transparency and accountability to determine what was occurring in those markets. To consider it a radical idea that we might want to have accountability and transparency I find remarkable considering what our country has been through. Also, we provided a consumer protection bureau. What a radical idea that is--the idea that people who buy mortgages or have a student loan, a credit card, a car loan, might have someplace in this city that watches out for them so their jobs, their homes, their retirement accounts are not lost. So while this bureau is in place in this bill, the idea was at least to see to it that people, when they have the problems they have been through or are going through, someone is watching out for them. We have a Consumer Product Safety Commission to address the purchase of a faulty product, but what happens when someone abuses or takes advantage, as happens in so many cases in financial areas? People should have a chance to have a redress of their grievance or to at least from the outset have an opportunity to address that before it becomes a broader problem. So, Madam President, again, we have debated this now for 2 years and countless opportunities. We spent 4 weeks on the floor of this Chamber, amendments were offered, and never once--I guess on one occasion we had a supermajority vote. There was only one tabling motion I know of. I did everything I could to make this as inclusive a process as possible. I understand some people don't like the bill. It saddens me, in a way, that it has once again become sort of a mindless partisan argument rather than talking about what we need to be doing. This is not the end of all of it, obviously. Oversight will be required, consultation in the coming weeks and months and years, to make this work well. But, Madam President, I can't imagine another process that has been as inclusive. My colleagues will recall that almost 10 months, going on almost a year ago, I invited both Democrats and Republicans on the Banking Committee to assume responsibility for major sections of this bill, which they did do, by the way, and made a significant contribution to the product. So while I respect those who want to vote against the bill, and that is their right to do so, find some arguments based on the merits rather than arguing about whether there was a process that was inclusive or that allowed people the opportunity to be heard. Again, we have the right to be heard, but we don't have the right necessarily to have our ideas become the law of the land. That is what a body like this is for. So this is a major undertaking, one that is historic in its proportions, and it is an attempt to set in place a structure that will allow us to minimize problems in the future. I can't legislate integrity. I can't legislate wisdom. I can't legislate passion or competency. What we can do is to create the tools and the architecture that allow good people to do a good job on behalf of the American public. That is what a bill like this is designed to do. I regret I can't give jobs back, restore foreclosed homes, or put retirement monies back into accounts. What I can do is to see to it that we never, ever again have to go through what this Nation has been through. That is what this effort has been about over the last several years, to try to create that structure, that architecture. It will be incumbent now on the present administration and those who follow to nominate good people to head up these operations, to attract good public servants who will fill the jobs of these various regulatory bodies to see to it that they do the work we all want them to do. Again, I can't legislate that. I can merely create the opportunity for that kind of protection to occur--to modernize a financial system, to lead the world, if we can, in harmonizing rules so we don't have the kind of sovereign shopping that was going on with regulatory bodies, where major financial institutions would shop around the world as to the nation of least resistance or the regulator of least resistance. We need to see to it that we have the unanimity or at least the harmonization of rules that will allow us to have a more orderly system in our globe because, as we have all painfully learned, matters that occur thousands of miles away can affect the economy in our own country. So for all those reasons, Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their efforts over the last 2 years. I thank the leadership for providing the opportunity and time for us to do this in this Chamber. I thank my colleague in the House, Barney Frank, and his colleagues for the work in which they engaged in order to produce a bill there. We spent 2 weeks, some 70 hours of debating the conference report, where more amendments were adopted--again, offered by my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats--to make this as good a bill as we could in all of this. So with that, Madam President, I will reserve some comments for later, but as we approach this vote in the next few minutes, I urge my colleagues to invoke cloture, to allow us to then have an up-or-down vote on this bill, and to do what we can to restore some trust and confidence and optimism for the American people. In the midst of the worst economic crisis in the lives of most Americans, this institution--the Senate--rose to the occasion and crafted a bill to address the financial [[Page S5879]] service structure of our Nation to once again give us the hope that we can see wealth created, jobs produced, and an economy that will offer opportunities for the next generation of Americans. I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion, and I urge them to support the bill when the vote occurs later today. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, later today, we will have a decisive vote on the financial regulatory bill that does nothing to reform the government-sponsored enterprises that many people believe to have been at the root of the financial crisis this bill grew out of--a bill that was meant to rein in Wall Street but which is now supported by some of Wall Street's biggest banks and opposed by small community banks in my State; a bill that is meant to help the economy but which is widely expected to stifle growth and kill more jobs in the middle of a deep recession; and a bill that, according to the papers, the vast majority of Americans simply don't think will work. As it turns out, the American people don't seem to like this government-driven solution to the financial crisis any more than they liked the Democrats government-driven solution to the Nation's health care crisis. They do not think this bill will solve the problems in the financial sector any more than they think the health care bill will lead to lower costs or better care. One survey this week indicates that 7 in 10 Democrats have little confidence the proposals in this bill will avert or lessen the impact of another financial catastrophe, and nearly 70 percent of them doubt it will make their savings more secure. It is easy to see why. The Wall Street Journal calls this bill's 2,300 pages ``the biggest wave of new Federal financial rulemaking in three generations.'' The chairman of the Banking Committee has famously said last month we would not know how this bill works until it is in place. But here are some initial indicators about its scope according to a study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the new bureaucratic landscape under this bill: 70 new Federal regulations through the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 54 new Federal regulations through the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 11 new Federal regulations through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 30 new Federal regulations through the Federal Reserve, and 205 new regulations through the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those are just some of them. All told, this bill would impose 533 new regulations on individuals and small businesses, regulations that will inevitably lead to the kind of confusion and uncertainty that will make it even harder for struggling businesses to dig themselves out of the recession. It is just this kind of uncertainty that will deter lending and freeze up credit as lenders wait to see how they will be affected by the new regulations. It is just this kind of uncertainty that businesses cite time and time again as one of the greatest challenges to our economic recovery. So here is a bill that fails to address the root causes of the kind of crisis it is meant to prevent, that creates a vast new unaccountable bureaucracy, that--if past experience is any guide--will lead to countless burdensome, unintended consequences for individuals and small businesses; a bill that constricts credit and stifles growth in the middle of the worst economic period in memory; and perhaps most distressing of all, a bill that punishes farmers, florists, doctors, retailers, and countless others across the country and far away from Wall Street who had absolutely nothing to do with the panic of 2008. In other words, once again, the administration and its Democratic allies in Congress have taken a crisis and used it rather than solving it. How else can you explain the fact a bill that was meant to address the excesses on Wall Street is expected to hit individuals and industries that had nothing to do with the crisis it was meant to prevent? Did anybody think when this bill was first proposed that it would end up hurting storefront check cashers, city governments, small manufacturers, home buyers, credit bureaus, and farmers in places such as Kansas and Kentucky? This is precisely the kind of thing Americans are tired of--a government simply out of control. Only in Washington would you create a commission aimed at looking into the causes of a crisis, then put together and pass a 2,300-page bill in response to that crisis before the commission even has a chance to report its findings and issue recommendations. The White House will call this a victory. But as credit tightens, regulations multiply, and job creation slows even further as a result of this bill, they will have a hard time convincing the American people this is a victory for them. Obviously, I will be opposing this bill, and I would encourage my colleagues to oppose it as well. Madam President, I yield the floor. Mr. DODD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent the time during the quorum be equally charged to both sides. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REID. Madam President, the Wall Street earthquake that sent shock waves around the world has not hit anywhere as hard as it hit Nevada. You can draw a straight line from unchecked greed on Wall Street to the collapse of the housing market on Main Streets throughout my State and around the country. As soon as the big banks went down, foreclosure signs went up. How did this happen? Let's put it this way: When you go to any of the great casinos across Nevada and put your chips on the table, you are gambling with your own money. If you win, you win, and if you lose, you lose. But Wall Street rigged the game. They put our money on the table. When they won, they won big. The jackpots they took home were in the billions. And when they lost--and, boy, did they lose--they came crying to the taxpayers for help. The winnings were theirs to enjoy but the losses were all of ours, to share and to shoulder. That is the way the market worked. It worked for a few fortunate ones in the big firms and worked against everyone else. So when I say that is how the market worked, what I mean is that it didn't work at all. It was badly broken and it nearly bankrupted us. It cost 8 million workers their jobs, millions of retirees their savings, and millions of families their homes. It shattered our faith in our financial system. But there is another problem. We have been talking about this rigged system, this raw deal, in the past tense, but it is not a thing of the past. It is very much in the present. The rules that allowed Nevada's economy to collapse are still the same rules of the road today. That means every new day we do not act we run the risk of it happening all over again. That is a gamble I am not willing to take. The bill before us makes sure we do not have to take that gamble. The first question was, How did this happen? The next question is, What are we going to do about it? No. 1, we are saying to those who gamed the system that the game is over. We are cracking down on those who gambled away what so many have worked so hard to put away. No. 2, we are saying to the families and taxpayers, never again will you be asked to bail out a big bank when the bank loses its risky bets. Let me say that again because it is one of the most important parts of this bill: No more bailouts because no bank is too big to fail. We are going to give consumers and investors the strongest protections they have ever had against abusive banks, mortgage companies, credit card companies, and credit rating agencies. We are going to bring derivative markets that operate in the darkness out into the light. We are going to hold Wall Street accountable because we know we are accountable to the American people. This is about our ability to trust our financial system, it is about giving families the peace of [[Page S5880]] mind they deserve, the peace of mind that comes with the knowledge they will be able to keep their homes and their savings will be safe. We need a free market to thrive and grow and succeed. We acknowledge that. But there also have to be some rules, not to stifle but to safeguard us; rules so that when these firms fail they don't bring us down with them. When this earthquake hit there was not nearly enough oversight, transparency, or accountability to shield us from the fallout. This law will change that. It will strengthen all three. We are at the finish line this morning but getting here has not been easy. Wall Street doesn't like this bill. Of course it doesn't. Why would they want us to change the system they rigged, the system that made them all rich? Their cronies in Washington don't like it either. The top Republican in the House very publicly said the plight of millions was as small and insignificant as an ant, an insect; foreclosures, homes underwater, jobs lost--like an ant. The head of the Republican party asked us to simply trust Wall Street to look after itself. We all know this crisis is enormous and we all know Wall Street is not going to reform itself. Rather than standing up for the taxpayers, those who are about to vote no are standing with the same bankers who gambled away our jobs and homes and our economic security in the first place. Just like their Wall Street friends, it seems our opponents care more about making short-term gains than they do about what is right for the economy in the long run. I think that is a mistake and I think it is a shame. This is not about dollars and cents only, it is about fairness. It is about justice. It is about making sure there is not a next time. It is about jobs. It is about rescuing our economy. I know Wall Street reform is complicated. There are not many people who know all the ins and outs of derivative trading and credit default swaps or mortgage-backed securities. But the principle before us is quite simple. It is not complicated at all. You either believe that we need to strengthen the oversight of Wall Street or you don't. You either believe we need to strengthen protections for consumers or you don't. Our choice today is between learning from the mistakes of the past or dangerously letting them happen all over again. Cloture Motion The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to report the motion to invoke cloture. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference report to accompany H.R. 4173, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Harry Reid, Christopher J. Dodd, Charles E. Schumer, Sheldon Whitehouse, Amy Klobuchar, Thomas R. Carper, Benjamin L. Cardin, Jeff Merkley, Kay R. Hagan, John F. Kerry, Tom Harkin, Jack Reed, Frank R. Lautenberg, Mark Begich, Barbara Boxer, Mark R. Warner, Joseph I. Lieberman. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the conference report to accompany H.R. 4173, Restoring Financial Security Act of 2010, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo). The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 60, nays 38, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 206 Leg.] YEAS--60 Akaka Baucus Bayh Begich Bennet (CO) Bingaman Boxer Brown (MA) Brown (OH) Burris Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Collins Conrad Dodd Dorgan Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Hagan Harkin Inouye Johnson Kaufman Kerry Klobuchar Kohl Landrieu Lautenberg Leahy Levin Lieberman Lincoln McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murray Nelson (NE) Nelson (FL) Pryor Reed Reid Rockefeller Sanders Schumer Shaheen Snowe Specter Stabenow Tester Udall (CO) Udall (NM) Warner Webb Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--38 Alexander Barrasso Bennett (UT) Bond Brownback Bunning Burr Chambliss Coburn Cochran Corker Cornyn DeMint Ensign Enzi Feingold Graham Grassley Gregg Hatch Hutchison Inhofe Isakson Johanns Kyl LeMieux Lugar McCain McConnell Murkowski Risch Roberts Sessions Shelby Thune Vitter Voinovich Wicker NOT VOTING--1 Crapo The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On this vote, the yeas are 60 and the nays are 38. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am about to propose a unanimous-consent request that has been agreed to by the respective leaders. I ask unanimous consent that the postcloture time be considered expired at 2 p.m., with the time until then equally divided and controlled between Senators Dodd and Shelby or their designees; that during this period, if and when a budget point of order is raised against the conference report, then an applicable waiver of the point of order be considered made; that at 2 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to waive the applicable budget point of order; that if the waiver is successful, without further intervening action or debate, the Senate vote on adoption of the conference report. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DODD. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to make a point of order that the Senator from Connecticut alluded to. We have rules around here we have set up to discipline ourselves on spending. Unfortunately, we consistently ignore and waive them. That is one of the reasons we have a $13 trillion debt. That is one of the reasons we will have a $1.4 trillion deficit this year alone. This bill violates those rules. This bill violates one of the sections of those rules which says that in any 10-year period, we shall not have more than a $5 billion effect on the deficit in a negative way; that we need to otherwise pay for what we are doing. Therefore, this bill does violate the Budget Act. If we are going to have any fiscal discipline around here--and we hear a lot of people talking about that--we should be living by the rules we have to assert fiscal discipline. Therefore, I make a point of order that the pending bill violates section 311(b) of S. Con. Res. 70 of the 110th Congress. Mr. DODD. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and those budget resolutions for purposes of the pending conference report and ask for the yeas and nays. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. GREGG. I understand the vote will occur somewhere around 2 o'clock. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. Mr. DODD. Madam President, I see my colleague from Texas is seeking recognition. I wish to publicly thank her. She made a substantial contribution to this bill on several amendments that were adopted during debate on the floor. I thank her for them. They added to the value of the legislation. I am not sure what her comments will be right now, but I thank her for her contributions. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is recognized. Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the chairman. He accommodated many of the amendments I had, particularly as it concerns community banks. That was a huge concern in the original [[Page S5881]] draft of the bill. I thank the chairman for accommodating those concerns. It did make it a better bill. I wish to return to the aftermath of the financial crisis, when Congress was tasked with the responsibility of modernizing our financial regulatory structure so that we would have proper oversight of today's banking system and financial markets. We were called to fill in gaps in regulations which allowed American home buyers to simply sign on the dotted line to purchase a house that was in many instances beyond their means, to let companies hide trillions of dollars in assets from regulators, and ultimately led our government to lose hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out financial institutions--Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, GM, Chrysler, and AIG. Thus, were financial regulatory reform to succeed, we needed to enhance mortgage underwriting standards, bring greater transparency to the derivatives markets, and once and for all end too big to fail. The conference report before us takes steps toward these goals. The legislation puts in place measures to address too big to fail; however, it falls short in fully addressing the risk of future government bailouts by failing to make changes to the Bankruptcy Code. In this legislation, we have also made strides to strengthen mortgage underwriting standards. I am concerned that a newly formed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take the lead rather than our banking regulators, and this is one of the biggest concerns I have with the bill. I am pleased that the conference report includes numerous measures for which I fought. I thank Chairman Dodd for his willingness to work with me and his constructive approach to making changes to the bill, including a more level playing field for community banks across the country to compete through my amendment to bring parity to FDIC insurance assessments; my amendment, along with Senator Klobuchar, to allow State-chartered banks and small and medium-size bank holding companies to retain Federal Reserve supervision so that our monetary policy truly reflects economic conditions throughout the country, not just on Wall Street; relief for small and medium-size public companies from the burden of rule 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley; and assurance that the Volcker rule's proprietary trading restrictions will not extend to the insurance affiliates of insurance companies with depository institutions. These are positive changes for which I give the chairman great credit. However, these positive changes are greatly outweighed by misplaced priorities to create new layers of bureaucracy while failing to address the root causes of the financial crisis--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additionally, there are a series of provisions that are troubling to me. No. 1 is this consumer protection bureau. It is using the faults of Wall Street banks and executives to create a cumbersome new bureaucracy which will impose job-killing regulation at the expense of Main Street small businesses and families. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with endless authority over all facets of our economy, is not the answer. I am particularly concerned about the effect this bureau will have on well-regulated, safe, sound community banks. These banks largely avoided the subprime market, and they didn't engage in the risky speculative trades that contributed to the financial meltdown. However, these community banks are going to have 27 new or expanded types of regulation after this bill is passed. The consumer bureau could ultimately determine what products community banks can offer, on what terms they can offer these products, and under what settings and circumstances. Overall, the consumer bureau will result in fewer products and services for American families and small businesses. The Texas Bankers Association tells me consumer bureau rules could result in the end of free checking accounts, higher fees on all consumer services, and less opportunity to negotiate on loans. It is not the big banks on Wall Street voicing concerns and opposition to this bill. The opposition is coming from community bankers in Texas who are worried they will be unduly penalized for faults they did not commit. Small businesses are also against this new consumer bureau. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business are very concerned about this bureau. We need community banks to continue extending credit to worthy families looking for a home and to small businesses to invest in and create jobs. I cosponsored an amendment during Senate consideration to ensure that safety and soundness regulators would have a say in the rules and regulations imposed on their institutions. That amendment was rejected, leaving community banks subject to this new bureau's unlimited and unchecked rulemaking authority. I am also concerned with the treatment of derivatives in this legislation. I am concerned that the lack of transparency that needed reform has been exchanged for a regulation I do not think is going to properly regulate derivatives. However, we must also protect end users such as airlines, utilities, manufacturers, and oil and gas companies. These companies use derivatives as a cost effective strategy to control price and risk. Many structure derivatives contracts are unique to their business, making it difficult to clear and trade on a market. I share concerns from derivatives end users that this mandate to post margins with cash, rather than collateral, will remove capital from investment and job creation. While Senator Dodd and Senator Lincoln say that this legislation will not impose margin requirements, I worry that there is not a statutory exemption for end users. End users may even choose market volatility instead of risk-controlling derivatives altogether, exposing Americans to higher prices, slower economic growth, and more job losses. We should seek transparency through greater reporting requirements, but businesses should not be forced to arbitrarily move money to margin accounts. I am concerned that this legislation will cost more jobs at a particularly harmful time with national unemployment hovering around 10 percent. The Chamber of Commerce reports that the margin requirement on OTC derivatives could cost 100,000 to 120,000 jobs in S&P 500 companies alone. This legislation does nothing to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Since the government takeover of these two GSEs, taxpayers have paid $145 billion to keep them afloat. The CBO reports that the government's cost to bail out Fannie and Freddie will eventually reach $381 billion. These costs contributed to a Federal deficit which has topped $1 trillion for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2010. They have helped push our national debt to $13 trillion. A couple of weeks ago, the CBO reported that United States debt will reach 62 percent of GDP by the end of this year, the highest since just after World War II. We cannot continue to this dangerous path and mirror the crisis that currently ravages Europe. We cannot sustain these debts and deficits. We offered solutions to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. During Senate consideration of this legislation, I cosponsored amendments--No. 3839 and No. 4020--which would have re-imposed the cap of Federal assistance to the GSEs at $200 billion each. These amendments would have brought Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac onto our budget so that Americans could see their true cost. And they would have brought an end to Fannie and Freddie's government conservatorship in 2 years. Unfortunately, these amendments were rejected. Furthermore, the conference committee would not even permit amendments to be offered on the GSEs. Instead, this legislation calls for a report, punting the plan for Fannie and Freddie that we need to the future. We need reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac now, but this legislation does not even allow for debate of the GSEs. The American people are frustrated with our government, and this legislation is an example of why. Under the guise of financial regulatory reform, this legislation continues the unprecedented growth in government. The American people want sensible financial reform. However, this purported financial regulatory reform legislation does not even address the root causes of the crisis: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead, it uses the crisis to add layers of Federal bureaucracy, [[Page S5882]] and threatens to slow down our economic recovery, risking job loss and restricting access to credit. For these reasons, this legislation is not the reform we need, which is why I must oppose the conference report for H.R. 4173. We need to fully look at some of the concerns in this bill with the hope that when it passes--I cannot support it, but it will pass--these cautions will be looked at going forward to perhaps, when the problems come to light later, make some changes to the law that will better accommodate the needs of consumers and small businesses and community banks in the country. There are good parts of this bill. I think the chairman deserves a lot of credit for pushing this financial reform, knowing that we needed to do it. I don't think it fully meets the test of doing what we should be doing, but I do think it is a first step, and the chairman is to be commended for his leadership. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. DODD. Madam President, my friend and colleague from Texas serves on the Banking Committee. I thank her and Senator Klobuchar. There was a series of amendments in which Senator Hutchison was involved. They added value to this bill, and I thank her for it. I mentioned yesterday, as a relatively junior member of the Banking Committee, there was no Member of this Chamber who added as much to the bill as the Senator from Virginia. There are not words nor time for me to adequately express my gratitude for his involvement. Literally almost on an hourly basis, he was involved, along with Senator Corker of Tennessee. They spent hours on their own talking with other people about how to fashion two of the most critical titles of this bill. Let me express my gratitude once again to Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and thank him immensely for his contribution. He did a great job. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the chairman for those kind remarks. It is a good feeling for all of us who have labored on this legislation--Members and staff--that we are finally coming to a successful conclusion on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and it is going to be enacted into law. As those equally controversial pieces of legislation in the 1930s stood the test of time for decades, I think this bill will stand the test of time for decades as well in terms of creating a new set of rules of the road for not just America's financial sector but, in a sense, the world's financial sector for decades to come. While not perfect--no piece of legislation is--one of the things that gives me some confidence that the right balance has been struck is that this bill has been criticized by both the left and the right. Some on the left, some on the Democratic side, have said the bill has not gone far enough in putting more requirements and restrictions on our financial institutions. Some of my colleagues on the Republican side, on the right, have said this bill goes too far. The fact that it is getting perhaps that left-and-right criticism puts us maybe in that right-in-the-middle section, which is the appropriate balance we tried to strike since the chairman started this effort well over 2 years ago. I think it is important at times we remember why we are here. Two years ago, the markets were in chaos. President Bush and Secretary Paulson had created TARP with a $700 billion unprecedented bailout to shore up our financial system. President Obama was in crisis mode with our economy still in free-fall from day one. The Dow was at 6,500, and there was a lot of talk of nationalizing banks. Well, close to a year and a half to 2 years later, we have seen stimuluses and stress tests. We have seen a DOW that now has touched 11,000. While the economy is not creating jobs at the rate any of us would like to see, the talk of financial Armageddon or complete collapse has disappeared. I think we went into this process with three goals: First, the taxpayers must never again hear that a company is too big to fail. Second, we had to fix our regulatory system to make sure the huge gaps that existed that allowed systemic regulatory arbitrage could no longer take place. And, finally, consumers and investors had to have confidence that our markets were fair, transparent, and that there would be an officer on the beat to make sure some of the excesses that took place in 2005, 2006, and 2007--where folks were being put into homes they could never afford to pay for or having financial instruments that were being created under the guise of lowering the cost of risk that were more about simply creating fee income--would never again prey on unweary investors or on homeowners who got themselves into trouble. I think one of the most interesting critiques that some still make of the bill is that we have not addressed too big to fail. Well, candidly, with the United States moving first on this legislation, and the rest of the world waiting for the United States to move, we hear from our European colleagues that the framework we have set up, actually, they hope to emulate. We have created a new regulatory structure so the regulators can get out of their silos--depository institutions on one side, security institutions on another, derivatives trading on a third--and make sure we have a full systemic risk council so we can measure risk wherever it exists, regardless of the charter of the organization. While some said we ought to go ahead and limit the asset size of some of our institutions, just on size alone, I think the chairman wisely decided as we went through a year and a half of hearings, what often precipitated the greatest risks to our system was not size alone-- America has only 4 of the 50 largest banks in the world--but it was the interconnectedness, their leverage, their failure to have appropriate risk management plans in place. This new systemic risk council is specifically charged with making sure our large, more complex institutions have more stringent capital requirements, leverage ratios, liquidity requirements, and risk management tools. We even created two whole new categories, that while not fully tested--both of these categories actually came from colleagues on the other side of the aisle--they could be important new steps to prevent these large institutions from failing. One is contingent debt that large institutions would have to have that if they get themselves even close to trouble, that debt would convert into equity, consequently diluting existing shareholders and management and keeping pressure on the board to make sure management would not take that risk. Finally, a tool that, again, if implemented correctly, will be tremendously powerful; that is, to ensure that all these large, complex institutions provide a plan about how they will be able to unwind in an orderly fashion through traditional bankruptcy provisions. Our goal is to always have bankruptcy be the appropriate response. If that liquidation plan or if that debt plan is not blessed by the council of regulators, the council of regulators can dismember, break up, or put other restrictions on these large institutions. I think Senator Dodd made the decision to task my good friend, Senator Corker of Tennessee, and I with this issue: If those processes still do not work, how do we make sure we have an orderly liquidation process? Our goal was twofold: One, taxpayers should never have to bear the risk; and, two, if an entity goes into liquidation, it will not come out. Liquidation or resolution is not an attempt to stand up an institution. But we wanted to make clear to shareholders, to management, if you go into resolution, you are toast, as my colleague, Senator Corker, often said. We think we have reached that goal, and I am particularly proud of titles I and II of this bill. Actually, when Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby put some amendments to it, it was endorsed by 95 of our colleagues. It is the broadest bipartisan section of this legislation. This bill addresses a number of other vital areas as well. It allows a single depository place to get the appropriate day-to-day information on our financial institutions--that still did not exist until we created the Financial Services Oversight Council--and having the ability to get on a daily basis the level of interconnectiveness of a future AIG. [[Page S5883]] It puts in place a consumer protection bureau to make sure, for example, mortgages are regulated in a way that consumers can understand, regardless of the charter of the organization. We often found banks had a fairly good ability to regulate some of their mortgages; whereas, mortgage lenders and others, who were unregulated, had no such restrictions. Now we have an even playing field. It finally puts in place--there is some debate on this issue--an appropriate process to regulate derivatives and to bring these critical but potentially dangerous instruments out of the shadows, and the vast majority of these instruments will now be traded in a more transparent way on exchanges. There is more to be done. Domestic and international implementation is vitally important. As I mentioned at the outset, the United States-- and this is one of the things that is kind of remarkable, when I hear from some of my colleagues we have moved too quickly or this bill does too much--candidly, the whole rest of the world has been waiting on America to act to set the template for broad-based financial reform. Now that we have acted, I think particularly Europe and Asia will follow our stead. But making sure we do this with appropriate international implementation is terribly important--the Basel circumstances--but also making sure we have the regulatory approach across the world correct so there is not an international ability to arbitrage with these large financial institutions. I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also raised the question that this bill does not fully address the GSEs. They are right. But I think it was the right and conscious decision of the chairman and others that to disrupt an already still fragile housing market at this moment in time in a piece of legislation that has already been accused by some as being too broad and covering too many items was not the appropriate choice. We will have to come back and deal with GSEs. We have to make sure, as we deal with GSEs, international implementation, we stay vigilant. We have given the regulators the tools. How they use these tools will be up to us in Congress to make sure they are implemented correctly with appropriate oversight. I am, in certain ways, disappointed this bill is not being passed with broader bipartisan legislation. But we have only gotten here because there is bipartisan support. I want to close acknowledging again--the chairman was very kind in his remarks--I cannot think, in my short tenure in the Senate, of any other Senator who has worked harder on a piece of legislation, who has been more relentless, who has had more twists and turns, who has had more ``we are there; but, oh, my gosh, we may not be there,'' who has had probably more 10 o'clock, 2 o'clock in the morning, 4 o'clock in the morning, I believe at one point, telephone calls and meetings with other Members. As the Senator from Texas mentioned earlier, even though the Senator from Texas could not support the overall bill, our chairman has worked with all Members regardless of party to try to accommodate their interests. I commend the Senator from Texas for pointing out, for example, the community-based and independent banks come out of this legislation as one of the real winners in terms of their ability to have more fair competition with the larger institutions. So I commend the chairman, and I commend all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, even those who perhaps will not vote for the final product but were a part of building the product, where their ideas were implemented. When we think about the Glass-Steagalls, and when we think about the bills that created the SEC, when we think about the legislation in the 1930s, in the moment of crisis, that created the financial framework for 20th-century American capitalism, what this bill has done--there will be work done to improve and fully implement it, but what this bill has done has set a framework for 21st-century American capitalism and, in a certain way, a framework for 21st-century capitalism across the world in a way that America can remain the center for financial markets but at the same time making sure both consumers and the investing public are protected in this new and very challenging world. With that, I yield the floor. I again extend my compliments to the chairman and all who have been involved in this legislation. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. KYL. Madam President, I, too, would like to speak to the conference report on financial regulatory reform, which we will presumably vote on in a couple of hours. I think we all agree that the purpose of financial regulatory reform should have been to tackle the problems that led to the financial crisis in the first place. That means serious reform must, at the very least, end too-big-to-fail financial institutions and rein in two government-sponsored enterprises, the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But despite its size and the hype behind it, the bill before us fails in those two key respects. Moreover, even though Main Street did not cause the problem, the bill is so pervasive in its regulatory reach that it creates new burdens for Main Street businesses. I am not sure that is what the bill's supporters want or its authors intend, but that will be the result. For example, a July 4 Wall Street Journal news article entitled ``Finance Overall Casts Long Shadow on the Plains'' explains how new derivatives rules will harm America's livestock farmers. There are other problems with the bill. The biggest new problem it causes is the harm to the availability of credit, something our colleague, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, has talked a lot about. It implements one-size-fits-all capital standards and uses flawed funding mechanisms. It also perpetuates bailouts, and burdens small businesses with new regulations, which I will speak about in a moment. Let me address a few of these problems in more detail: First, the cost and offsets of the bill; second, the failure to address the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and, third, the job-killing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that will reduce available credit for American businesses and thus reduce job creation. First, the cost and offsets. The Congressional Budget Office has put the 10-year cost of the conference report bill at approximately $19 billion. That is the cost of this alleged new reform. Democrats initially tried to fund this obligation with a new tax imposed on large financial institutions. When that could not be sustained, they decided on a new funding mechanism that, as National Review recently editorialized, ``were a corporation to try it, would get its accountants sent to prison for fraud.'' Here is how it works. The bill would now ``cancel'' the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, a few months early, thus ``saving,'' theoretically, the government around $11 billion, even though it is highly unlikely that money would ever have been used to make additional TARP loans. That $11 billion would then be used to partially offset the cost of the bill. Remember, that is money that has to be borrowed. So instead of simply borrowing 11 billion fewer dollars, we are going to pretend as though we already have that money and that we can save it by not spending it on TARP, so we will spend it on this legislation. It is a double counting that National Review is right about: It would have put a private business CEO or CFO in jail if he had tried to do an accounting trick such as that. The TARP law moreover states that any money rescinded from TARP shall not be counted for the purpose of budget enforcement. But to avoid violating the so-called pay-go rule in the House, the conference report nevertheless uses this alleged savings to pay for the financial reform provisions, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of the TARP law. And, as I said, taking these funds to pay for something else rather than rescinding them simply pushes our Nation deeper into debt. So with regard to the cost of the bill--$19 billion--and the offset, much of which is not a true offset but simple double accounting with money we don't own or have anyway, but have to borrow, is a bad way to do business, to say the least, especially on something that is called a financial reform bill. Now, I guess, fortunately, we have changed the name to reflect the authors of the bill. It is no longer the financial reform bill; it is now the Dodd- [[Page S5884]] Frank bill. I appreciate the naming of the bill for my good friend, the Senator from Connecticut, but it is supposed to be about financial reform, and it isn't financial reform when you take money you don't have, spend it for something you are not legally able to spend it for, and call that an offset for the cost of the bill. Nevertheless, problem No. 2: Fannie and Freddie. It is just unconscionable that this bill doesn't attempt to reform in any way the two biggest causes of the problem: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It was their reckless behavior that was a major cause of the financial crisis. It is not for lack of trying on Republicans' part. Our Democratic friends say: Well, we will do that later, maybe next year. I suggest doing that is highly improbable. The way things work around here is, when you do a comprehensive bill such as this, there are a lot of tradeoffs, a lot of different interests involved. If you can't include all of the elements in one bill, it is very difficult to find the political will to tackle the biggest problem of all--Fannie and Freddie--next year without the leverage of the other provisions of the bill to deal with. The behavior of these two institutions--these GSEs that have come to epitomize too big to fail--has surged through the entire commercial banking sector and our economy as a whole and has turned out to be one of the most expensive aftereffects of the financial crisis. For years, Fannie and Freddie made mortgages available to too many people who could not afford them. Smaller companies were crushed while the two GSEs and their shareholders reaped enormous profits, recklessly taking advantage of the government's implicit guarantee to purchase trillions of dollars worth of bad mortgages, including those made to risky, so- called subprime borrowers. It was a textbook example of moral hazard on a massive scale. I was reminded of what I am speaking of this morning driving in and hearing an ad on the radio which said that through Fannie Mae, you could get a mortgage for 105 percent of the value of your home. Now that means that immediately you are so-called underwater; that is to say, you owe more than your home is worth. Why are we immediately making the same mistake with Fannie Mae that got us into the problem in the first place, where the mortgages exceeded the value of the homes? I don't understand it. The easy credit that was provided before is what helped to fuel the rising home prices that created the inflated housing bubble, especially in the subprime mortgage market. As prices rose, so too did the demand for even larger mortgages, so Fannie and Freddie looked for ways to make even more credit available to borrowers. But, of course, when the market collapsed, the two GSEs were left with billions of dollars of bad debt. By 2008 they held nearly $5 trillion in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. They were overleveraged but, unfortunately, deemed too big to fail. So what do we have today? Fannie and Freddie hold a combined $8.1 trillion of outstanding debt. Think of that: $8.1 trillion. In total, taxpayers have lost already $145 billion bailing them out. When Secretary of the Treasury Geithner lifted the bailout cap last December, it put the taxpayers on the hook for the remainder of these losses, for unlimited losses at these two institutions. So let's be clear. Every day that Fannie and Freddie remain in their current form is a day that U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the failed policies of the past. I think it is very doubtful we are going to get meaningful reform of Fannie and Freddie when it couldn't be done in the bill that is supposed to deal with all of the underlying problems that created the recession we are in now. The third problem: Harming small business through ``consumer protection.'' It harms far more than small business; it harms everyone who is attempting to get credit. As our friend and colleague, Senator Gregg, has said many times on this floor, perhaps the biggest problem with this legislation is the fact that it is going to make credit much more expensive for everyone. But let's start with small businesses. In my home State of Arizona and across the country, these are the entities that hire. They are supposed to be the first ones that hire coming out of a recession. The way they do that is to have access to credit. Well, they are obviously very wary of the intrusive new bureaucracy that masquerades as consumer protection in this bill, but which would compound the problem of credit availability. All of us here support the concept of consumer protection, so let's don't get off on a tangent of being for or against consumer protection. We all support that. The question is, How do you do it? Safeguards can be strengthened without creating a new regulatory bureaucracy with the powers that exist in this bill and all of the untoward ramifications that result. Unfortunately, the conference report maintains, with very little change, the flawed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from the bill that was passed in the Senate, the so-called CFPB. It is housed in and funded by the Federal Reserve but theoretically would operate as an independent agency with an enormous budget and with rule-writing ability and enforcement authority that I think will, in fact, create independence from the Fed. The CFPB could significantly reduce credit access for small businesses and thereby jeopardize America's economic recovery. Without available credit, companies cannot grow and consequently will not hire additional American workers. Obviously, that is not what the bill's authors intended, but it is the inevitable result. The new bureau will have a say in almost every aspect of American business. In an attempt to ensure--and I am quoting now--``ensure the fair, equitable and nondiscriminatory access to credit for individuals and communities''--the wording in the law--the new bureau will have latitude to impose its will, with few checks and balances, on American credit providers, all of which will result in more expense, more regulation, higher costs for consumers, and less availability of credit. The CFPB also exposes companies to very costly compliance and extensive enforcement proceedings, including potentially frivolous lawsuits, by eliminating national preemption and other means. In my view, the potentially serious costs of this bureau do not justify its purported benefits. Consumer protection could have been accomplished in much less intrusive and fairer ways. We all want to shield consumers from abuses and exploitation, but this is obviously not the right way to do it. So we should ask ourselves one question: Why is it that the CEOs of some of the largest companies on Wall Street, some of the largest financial institutions, actually favor this bill? Well, it is no skin off their backs. They have the money, and they have the resources and the personnel to deal with its complexity and to put the money up front and then charge the consumers on down the line. It would entrench their privileged status, as they have the resources to maneuver around its provisions, as I said, and would certainly institutionalize the idea that certain big financial firms deserve preferential treatment by Federal regulators. So for all of the reasons I have discussed, as well as others, and despite my strong desire to enact prudent financial reforms, I think this legislation is misguided. I can't support it, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. DODD. Madam President, I recognize my friend and colleague from Delaware. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the Dodd-Frank bill. I must start by expressing my awe--that old expression from Iraq, ``shock and awe''--at what Chairman Dodd has been able to do during this session of the Congress. I have been around this place since 1973, and I genuinely cannot think of an example where an individual Senator ever participated in passing three bills in one Congress of the magnitude of the health care bill, the credit card reform bill, and now the Dodd-Frank bill. If there is a legislative hall of fame, there is a spot for Chris Dodd in that hall of fame. [[Page S5885]] I am going to speak today about areas where I don't agree with this bill. Anyone who has followed my speeches on the floor would recognize that I have a difference of opinion on a number of issues. However, I wish to make it clear from the beginning--and I will raise it again in my speech--to the extent this bill doesn't reach where I want it to reach, the responsibility lies on my friends--and I truly mean my friends--and colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Time and again, vote after vote, they voted as a block to block meaningful reform on many issues. We can talk about the Brown-Kaufman amendment to break up the banks or we can talk about the maneuvers that were done on the Brownback bill so we never got a vote, and on Levin- Merkley. So as I give this speech today, the reason we didn't get the things I wanted in this bill is because 41 Republicans, time and time and time again--when there was a vote up they could have changed the way we do things; they could have instituted the kinds of reforms I wanted in this bill--voted against it. So Chairman Dodd was left with the problem of, How do we get the votes together to pass the bill? It is essential that we pass a bill, and a good bill, and we did, and I am voting for it. But it could have been, in my opinion, a better bill if several votes had gone the other way. After months of careful consideration, landmark financial reform legislation moves toward final passage. While this bill is a vast improvement over the existing regulatory structure, I believe it should go further with respect to erecting statutory rules that address the fundamental problem of too big to fail. Anyone who has heard my speeches on the Senate floor starting 4 or 5 months ago will understand my position on that. I made it abundantly clear. I will support the conference report, but I do so with reservations about a missed opportunity to enact meaningful reforms that would prevent another financial crisis. But as I said before, ultimately, given the makeup of the Senate and the requirement for 60 votes and the intransigence on the other side of the aisle, this was the best bill that could pass. For those who wish the bill were stronger, let there be no confusion about where the blame lies. It is because almost every Senator on the other side of the aisle did everything they could to stall, delay, and oppose Wall Street reform. To be sure, the bill that has come out of conference includes some extremely important reforms. It establishes an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with strong and autonomous rulemaking authority and the ability to enforce those rules for large banks and nonbank entities such as payday lenders and mortgage finance companies. In addition, it requires electronic trading and centralized clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives contracts, as well as more robust collateral margin requirements. The bill's inclusion of the Kanjorski provision will give regulators the explicit authority to break up megabanks that pose a ``grave threat'' to financial stability. I was pleased that the bill includes a provision I helped develop to give regulators enhanced tools and powers to pursue financial fraud. Through the Collins provision, the bill also establishes minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for bank holding companies and systemically risky nonbank institutions that are at least as stringent as those that apply to insured depository institutions, an important reform in this bill. In light of the failures of past international capital accords, this requirement will set a much-needed floor on how low capital can drop in the upcoming Basel III negotiations on capital requirements. It will also ensure that the capital base of megabanks is not adulterated with debt that masquerades as equity capital. That being said, unfortunately, I believe the bill suffers from two major problems. First, the bill delegates too much authority to the regulators. I have been around the Senate for 37 years. As I said on the Senate floor on February 4 of this year and in several speeches since then, I know that many times laws are not written with hard and clear lines. Laws are a product of legislative compromise, which often means they are vague and ambiguous. We often justify our vagueness by saying the regulators to whom we grant statutory authority are in a better position than we are to write the rules--and then to apply those regulatory rules on a case-by-case basis. But, as I have said, this was not one of those times. This was a time for Congress to draw hard lines that get directly at the structural problems that afflict Wall Street and our largest banks. Despite repeated urging from me and others to pass laws that would help regulators to succeed, Congress largely has decided instead to punt decisions to the regulators, saddling them with a mountain of rulemakings and studies. The law firm Davis Polk has estimated that the SEC alone must undertake close to 100 rulemakings and more than a dozen studies. Indeed, Congress has so choked the agencies with rulemakings and studies, the totality of the burden threatens to undermine the very ability of the agencies to accomplish their ongoing everyday mission. I for one urge the agencies carefully to triage these required rulemakings and studies, establish a hierarchy of priorities, and ensure that the agencies do not shift all resources to new rules meant to address old problems to such a degree that they fail to stay on top of current and growing problems. I will have more to say on this subject in a future speech. Second, the legislation does not go far enough in addressing the fundamental problem of ``too big to fail.'' Instead of erecting enduring statutory walls as we did in the 1930s, the bill invests the same regulators who failed to prevent the financial crisis with additional discretion and relies upon a resolution regime to successfully unwind complex and interconnected mega-banks engaged across the globe. I am also disappointed that key reform provisions like the Volcker Rule and the Lincoln swaps dealers spin-off provision were scaled back in conference. The bill mainly places its faith and trust in regulatory discretion and on international agreements on bank capital requirements and supervision. After decades of deregulation and industry self- regulation, it is incumbent upon the regulators now to reassert themselves and establish rulemaking and supervisory frameworks that not only correct their glaring mistakes of the past, but also anticipate future problems, particularly risks to financial stability. Unfortunately, the early indications we are seeing out of the G-20 and so-called Basel III discussions are not encouraging, as critical reforms are already being watered down and pushed back in part because some foreign regulators carelessly refuse to heed the risks posed by their megabanks. The legislation also puts in place a resolution authority to deal with these institutions when they inevitably get into trouble. While such authority is absolutely necessary, it is not sufficient. That is because no matter how well Congress crafts a resolution mechanism, there can never be an orderly wind-down of a $2-trillion financial institution that has hundreds of billions of dollars of off-balance- sheet assets, relies heavily on wholesale funding, and has more than a toehold in over 100 countries. Of course, since financial crises are macro events that will undoubtedly affect multiple megabanks simultaneously, resolution of these institutions will be enormously expensive. And until there is international agreement on resolution authority, it is probably unworkable. Given the history of financial regulatory failures and the enormous burden of rulemakings and studies with which the regulators are being tasked, Congress has a critical oversight responsibility. Congress first must ensure that the regulators have enough staff and resources at their disposal to follow through on their serious obligations. Just as important, Congress must monitor the regulatory phase of this bill's implementation closely to ensure that the regulators don't return to ``business as usual'' when the experience of the most recent financial crisis fades into memory. How quickly we forget. Time and again, I have heard people speak as if there was no big financial crisis, saying: I have a bank in my hometown that is going to have a problem with this legislation. So we should let all the banks be free to do whatever they [[Page S5886]] want to do. We had a crisis here that practically destroyed the country, the world, and these people are bringing up anecdotal evidence to give these banks more responsibility and not go after the root cause. For example, in addition to granting great discretion to regulators on how they interpret the ban on proprietary trading at banks, the scaled-back Volcker Rule contains a large loophole that allows megabanks to continue to own, control and manage hedge funds and private equity funds under certain conditions. Most notably, it includes a de minimis exception that permits banks to invest up to three percent of Tier 1 capital in hedge funds and private equity funds so long as their investments don't constitute more than three percent ownership in the individual funds. The impact of a supposedly small three percent de minimis exception for investments in hedge funds and private equity firms has the potential to be massive. For example, a $2 trillion bank that has $100 billion in Tier 1 capital would be able to invest $3 billion into hedge funds. Since that $3 billion could only constitute three percent ownership, it would need to be invested alongside at least $97 billion of funds from outside investors. The bank would therefore be able to manage $100 billion in hedge fund assets, a massive amount equal to the current size of the largest hedge funds in the world combined. What's more, that $100 billion in assets can be leveraged several times over through the use of borrowed funds and derivatives into overall exposures that could exceed a trillion dollars. And given the ambiguity of the legislative language, unless clarified by a rulemaking, some commentators have indicated that megabanks could potentially provide prime brokerage loans to hedge funds they partially own and run. Fortunately, the final bill does place costs on banks' de minimis investments in hedge funds and private equity funds. Specifically, the legislation requires a 100 percent capital charge on these proprietary investments, making them expensive for banks to hold. While this may be a helpful deterrent, I am concerned that it will not be enough of one, particularly when considering how lucrative and risky an activity it is for banks to run hedge funds and private equity funds. The overarching problem is that banks will continue to be able to offer and run--never mind, partially own--risky investment funds. Even though the scaled-back Volcker Rule includes a ``no bailout'' provision, I have concerns about the credibility of that edict. Under any circumstance, the failure of a massive hedge fund run by a megabank would pose serious reputational and financial risks to that institution. Just look at what happened when the structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, of Citigroup and other megabanks began to falter. Because of the reputational consequences of liquidating these funds and allowing them to default on their funding obligations, they were bailed out by the megabanks that spawned them even though the SIVs themselves were generally separate, off-balance-sheet entities with no official backing from the banks. Finally, the strength of the core part of the Volcker Rule--the ban on proprietary trading--will depend greatly on the interpretation of the regulators. They will ultimately be the arbiter of whether broad statutory exceptions for ``market making'' or ``risk-mitigating hedging'' or ``purchases'' or ``sales'' of securities on ``behalf of customers'' are allowed to swallow the putative prohibition. I therefore urge the regulators to construe narrowly those activities that constitute exceptions to proprietary trading to ensure that the Volcker Rule has some teeth in it. Senator Lincoln's original swap dealer spin-off provision would have prohibited banks with swap dealers from receiving emergency assistance from the Federal Reserve or FDIC. By essentially forcing megabanks to spin off their swap dealers into an affiliate or separate company, this section would have helped restore the wall between the government- guaranteed part of the financial system and those financial entities that remain free to take on greater risk. It would also have forced derivatives dealers to be adequately capitalized. While the final bill includes the Lincoln provision, it limits its application to derivatives that reference assets that are permissible for banks to hold and invest in under the National Bank Act. Since that exception covers interest rates, foreign exchange and other swaps, it ultimately exempts close to 90 percent of the over-the-counter derivatives market. Regulators must therefore reduce counterparty exposures by requiring the vast majority of derivatives contracts to be cleared and calibrate carefully the amount of capital that bank derivatives dealers must maintain. Only then can we be sure we never again face a meltdown caused by excessively leveraged derivatives exposure that no regulator helps to keep in check. The financial reform bill places enormous responsibilities and discretion into the hands of the regulators. Its ultimate success or failure will depend on the actions and follow-through of these regulators for many years to come. One of my main concerns is, if we elected another President who believed we should not have regulators and regulation, they would again have the ability to do what they did to cause a meltdown. It is estimated that various Federal agencies will be charged with writing over 200 rulemakings and dozens of studies. Many of the same regulators who failed in the run-up to the last crisis will once again be given the solemn task of safeguarding our financial stability. Like many others, I am concerned whether they have the capacity and wherewithal to succeed in this endeavor. I repeat again, Congress has an important role to play in overseeing the enormous regulatory process that will ensue following the bill's enactment. The American people, for that matter, must stay focused on these issues, if just to help ensure that Congress indeed will fulfill its oversight duty and its duty to intervene if the regulators fail. Likewise, although I will be leaving the Senate in November, I will be watching closely to see how the regulators follow through on the enormous responsibilities they are being handed. Let us not forget why reform is so necessary and important. After years of Wall Street malfeasance and the systematic dismantling of our regulatory structure, our financial system went into cardiac arrest and our economy nearly fell into the abyss. Wall Street, which had grown out of control on leverage and financial gimmickry, blew up. More than 8 million jobs were wiped out; millions more have lost their homes. We spent trillions of dollars in monetary easing and emergency measures to avert the wholesale failure of many of our megabanks. Not surprisingly, we continue to feel the aftershocks of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Every single thing you look at, almost without exception, when you read our newspapers, is related to our present economic situation, which was caused by lack of regulatory action on Wall Street. The banks are not lending. Fed Chairman Bernanke just days ago urged them to do more for small businesses. Companies and consumers alike remain shaken in their confidence. And despite dramatic stimulus measures, the economic recovery has been slow and tentative. Many of the opponents of Wall Street reform would like to make the dubious claim that the recovery is being held back by uncertainty about future regulations and taxes. Can you believe that? In reality, it is being held back by the financial shock and the fact that we are still in a period of financial instability and undergoing an excruciating process of deleveraging. Even now it is unclear whether a European banking crisis based on their holdings of sovereign debt will continue to impede that recovery. It is also being caused by the fact that Americans are losing faith in the credibility of our markets. Who wouldn't, after what has happened? I think it has been an important factor in our present hiccup-- hopefully, it was a hiccup and not a double dip. It is, therefore, imperative that we build a financial system on a firmer foundation. The American economy cannot succeed--cannot succeed--unless we restore and maintain financial stability--not only restore and maintain financial stability but maintain [[Page S5887]] the credibility of our financial system. We simply cannot afford another financial crisis or continued financial instability if the American economy is to succeed in the coming decades. Getting financial regulation right and maintaining it for years to come should be one of this Nation's highest priorities because the price of failure is far too high. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Delaware. He highlighted the difficulty in passing legislation. There are those who think it goes too far and those who think it does not go far enough. We do not write a bill on our own. There are 100 of us in this Chamber and 435 in the other. There are stakeholders, the administration--all sorts of people we deal with on these matters. What we try to do is fashion the best proposal we can that moves us forward and addresses the underlying causes, as we tried to with this bill. I appreciate the Senator's points that were raised during the debate and discussion. We tried to accommodate them where we could in fashioning legislation. It is always a difficult process. You do not get to write your own bill. You can write your own bill and introduce it, but ultimately, for it to become law requires cooperation. We had that cooperation. I appreciate his involvement very much. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I just laid it out. I taught a course on Congress in law school for 20 years. I say this in all sincerity: Houdini could not have gotten through this process. Really and truly, when one looks at it, Houdini could not have gotten through this process with a bill. I try very hard to be bipartisan in everything I do, and I try to speak well of my colleagues because I really do like every one of my colleagues on the other side. That is not hyperbole. But when we start out with 41 Senators bound and determined to slow down, delay, stop, and block, it makes the job the Senator from Connecticut has done even more incredible. And then we have to get 60 votes on anything of substance. Then we have to go over to the House side. And God bless our friends on the House side. When I talk with them, they just look over here and cannot believe we ever get anything done. Getting this bill done, getting it through the Senate, dealing with all the stakeholders, dealing with the administration, dealing with the folks on the House side, and, with all due respect, doing it three times in one Congress, is definitely a Hall of Fame performance. I thank the Senator again. Mr. DODD. Madam President, my colleague talked about 41. There are a number of Republicans who played a very critical and supportive role on this bill. I do not want the record to persist in suggesting that was not the case. Even people on the other side who ended up not voting for the bill--at least have not so far--added substantially to the value of this bill. In some cases, they might not want to acknowledge that, but they did. In the case of our two colleagues from Maine and our colleague from Massachusetts, they have taken an awful lot of abuse in the last number of weeks because they worked with us on the bill and made significant contributions. While they do not agree with every dotted ``i'' and crossed ``t,'' as I do not with this bill, they decided our country would be better off with the passage of this legislation than not. I do not want the record to be uncorrected when it comes to the number of people, including those three in particular, who will, I presume, continue to take some abuse from others because they did not toe the party line, nor have they on repeated occasions. They have acted as U.S. Senators, which is our first responsibility. I know what that feels like. I have been there on numerous occasions in my 30 years. Several times, I was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans on substantive matters. It is a lonely moment. I can tell my colleague what happens. It is painful, and you get those long looks from your colleagues. It is uncomfortable, to put it mildly. I will also tell my colleague that some of the proudest moments a colleague will have when they serve here is when they make those decisions and do so for the right reasons. While I am deeply grateful to my Democratic colleagues, many of whom had concerns about the bill, as my friend from Delaware did, and have been supportive all the way through, I guess there is a bit of the prodigal son--prodigal daughter in the case of our colleagues from Maine and prodigal son in the case of our colleague from Massachusetts--when they decided to stand up and help us get a bill done despite the criticism they have received. Everyone who has been supportive and helpful deserves credit, but I think those who were willing to take an awful lot of abuse in the process of doing so deserve commendation. I did not want to let that number stand--41--because it implies somehow there were people on the other side who were not helpful, and they were, including people who did not vote for the bill who were helpful as well. Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I totally agree with the Senator. It is oversimple. I know the Senator from Connecticut received a lot of support from the Republican side. I know how difficult it is to be the person standing in your caucus when everyone in your caucus wants to vote another way. I appreciate that. What is amazing to me is what passed was what the three of them would sign on to or others would sign on to. The idea that the Senator came with a bill--every one of my concerns I raised today, if we had gotten some help from the other side might have gone another way. But they were not going to go another way with the group we had. I could not agree with Senator Dodd more. I think it is easy to stand up in our caucus and be for this bill. I think what they did was truly courageous. But I also think that on every major issue, to have to figure out how we get 60 votes is a special, difficult problem. It is not like a swan dive. It is not, like they do in the Olympics, a double summersault. Putting all those things together is a triple summersault in the pike position. That is the point I want to make--the difficulty of getting a bill when we need to get 60 votes on every issue and there is a constant pressure on the other side for all to vote together one way. Mr. DODD. Madam President, I see our colleague from New Hampshire is here. I will save this for a later debate, but I know there is talk about changing the rules of the Senate because of the frustration Senators feel. I will make, in my waning hours here, as strong a plea as I can to not succumb to the temptation to change the institution because of the current frustrations people feel. There is a reason this institution exists and has the rules it does. All of us one day are in the minority or majority. The fact that some may abuse the rules, as has happened here without any question, ought not to be a justification for fundamentally changing them. There are ways to deal with the problem without losing the essence of the Senate. He is no longer with us, but my seatmate, Robert C. Byrd, would speak for hours on end about the importance of not letting the vagaries of the moment dictate the long-term interests of the institution. I will leave that for another day, but I appreciate it. My colleague from New Hampshire is here. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Chris Dodd, and be here on the floor this afternoon to talk about the financial regulatory reform bill that is pending. Before I begin my remarks, I wish to recognize Senator Dodd for his leadership and hard work in getting this conference report to the floor so that we can hopefully adopt it this afternoon. It is important because of what has happened in this country and what has happened in my State of New Hampshire. Over the past 2 years, people in New Hampshire and across the country have suffered the consequences of Wall Street's gambles. While we are seeing our economy in New Hampshire begin to rebound, which is thanks in no small part to the job creation that was spurred by the Recovery Act, it is critical that we act to prevent Wall [[Page S5888]] Street's risky, reckless behavior from ever again bringing our economy to its knees. We need to put in place reforms to stop Wall Street firms from growing so big and so interconnected that they can threaten our entire economy. We need to protect consumers from abusive practices and empower them to make sound financial decisions for their families. We need more transparency and regulation in the now shadowy markets where Wall Street executives and investment banks have made gambles. In those shadowy markets, the Wall Street firms got all the upside and American families got all the downside. We need to do everything we can to ensure that a financial crisis, such as the one we experienced in late 2008, never happens again. We need to ensure that taxpayers will not be asked to bail out Wall Street. In short, we need to pass the strong Wall Street reform bill that is before us today. It is also important to note that while this bill requires Wall Street banks to be held more accountable, it does not unfairly burden community banks. Community banks did not cause the financial crisis, and they should not have to pay for Wall Street's reckless behavior. That is particularly important to us in New Hampshire, where community banks make a huge difference for our cities and towns. That is why I joined with Senator Snowe on her amendment to eliminate the unnecessary, burdensome requirement that community banks and credit unions collect and report on various data about their depositors. I also sponsored another bipartisan amendment, one to make large, riskier banks pay their fair share of FDIC premiums and lower assessments for community banks. Community bank lending is really the lifeblood of New Hampshire's economy. Every dollar community banks have to pay for Wall Street's mistakes is a dollar that could be going to extend credit to small businesses and to home and consumer loans to families. I also joined Senator Collins on her amendment to require Wall Street banks to follow the same capital and risk standards small depository banks must follow. This amendment will make the risky banks that led us into this financial crisis--banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers--follow the same standards that already apply to small depository banks. This bill requires the big Wall Street banks to have adequate capital to prevent taxpayers from having to bail them out again. I am very pleased that those bipartisan amendments, which have strengthened the bill by protecting community banks, have been adopted. It speaks to the conversation Senator Dodd was having with Senator Kaufman earlier that this is a bill that has gotten broad support in this body and a lot of input that has made it better. I am glad we have been able to work in this bipartisan manner to craft a strong bill that reins in the reckless Wall Street conduct that brought us to the edge of financial disaster. It keeps community banks strong, and it protects consumers and taxpayers. I look forward to voting ``aye'' this afternoon when we get to the vote on the conference report. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. DODD. Madam President, briefly, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire. I see my other colleague from New Hampshire as well. It is a New Hampshire moment. I thank Senator Shaheen and our colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, for working as they did on the community bank issues. I was pleased, as I noted yesterday, that the Independent Community Bankers Association, while not endorsing the entire bill but specifically on their issues involving community banks expressed strong support for this bill and how much stronger these banks are today as a result of our efforts than would be the case if we were to defeat the legislation. Their ability to compete with these larger banks has been enhanced tremendously by what we have done in this bill. If these provisions were not adopted, they would be back in a situation where there would be significant disadvantages for them under the current law. I am very grateful to Senator Shaheen and Senator Snowe and others who supported their efforts to strengthen the role of our community banks that play such a critical role. As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, they were never a source of the problems in the residential mortgage market at all. That deserves to be repeated over and over. I thank the Senator for her comments. Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, Congress is now on the brink of passing a landmark deal on legislation to reform Wall Street and prevent another financial crisis like the one we faced nearly 2 years ago. This legislation is an important and long overdue measure that will help to safeguard the long-term stability of our economy. In the closing months of the Bush administration, our Nation faced an economic situation so dire that many feared our financial system was on the verge of collapse. Though we were able to avert such a collapse, the impact of the crisis spread across America, leaving few untouched. Virtually all of us have been impacted by the economic meltdown in some way: businesses shed jobs, workers' hours were cut, some folks had great difficulty making their mortgage payments when their pay was cut, small businesses lost customers and revenue in the downturn. South Dakota homeowners, regardless of whether they had a mortgage or owned their home outright, saw their equity drop, and most folks with investments for retirement or other long-term goals suffered losses either through the stock market plunge, bond market turbulence, or passbook savings interest rates that hovered near zero percent. Lending at our Nation's banks contracted, spending fell, and overall consumer confidence plummeted. Americans were rightly angry that while they were losing their homes, jobs, and long-term savings, they were also expected to foot the bill for the irresponsible actions of Wall Street CEOs. Their outrage only grew when these same CEOs continued collecting unprecedented bonuses-- presumably for their work in recklessly taking our Nation to the brink of collapse. Frankly, I share that anger. It is clear that our economy has not yet fully recovered, but in the last year and a half, Congress has dedicated itself to turning our economy around. We are now on the verge of passing historic legislation that creates better accountability and transparency for Wall Street and the financial sector. As a senior member of the Banking Committee, and a member of the conference committee, I have worked hard to identify the causes of the crisis and find the right solutions to address these causes. I have talked at length with South Dakotans of all backgrounds and political stripes to gain their perspective, and there are some things that get mentioned time and again: there were many causes for the meltdown, but gaps in regulation contributed to the problem; rules that applied to some financial companies but not all opened loopholes that bad actors could exploit; the lack of a system to monitor risks across the banking sector left taxpayers vulnerable; regulators were not very focused on looking out for consumers; and large Wall Street firms operated with little or no accountability to either their shareholders or their customers. In addition, it became clear we needed a system to unwind big financial firms like AIG, Lehman Brothers, and Bear Stearns in an orderly fashion and without taxpayer bailouts. Doing nothing is not an option, and I do not think anyone can say with a straight face that our current system of financial regulation works for America. While not perfect, the Wall Street reform measure does a great deal to address many of these problems. It creates a mechanism to monitor systemic risk in the financial sector, as well as regulating risky derivatives, credit default swaps and other complicated financial products that were not transparent and had previously gone unregulated. It affords consumers better rules governing the products they use and better information about those products by creating a consumer watchdog agency. Importantly, it also creates a way to unwind large financial firms without having to bail them out. Specifically, I want to mention two provisions. First, I am pleased that the conference committee accepted the [[Page S5889]] Carper-Bayh-Warner-Johnson amendment, which I strongly supported, regarding the preemption standard for State consumer financial laws. This amendment received strong bipartisan support on the Senate floor and passed by a vote of 80 to 18. One change made by the conference committee was to restate the preemption standard in a slightly different way, but it is clear that this legislation is codifying the preemption standard expressed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, 517 U.S. 25 (1996) case. This will provide certainty to consumers and those that offer consumers financial products. Also, section 913 of the conference report reflects a compromise between the House and Senate provisions on the standard of care for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers. It includes the original study provisions passed by the Senate, together with additional areas of study requested by the House--a total of 13 separate considerations and a number of subparts, where we expect the SEC to thoroughly, objectively and without bias evaluate legal and regulatory standards, gaps, shortcomings and overlaps. We expect the SEC to conduct the study without prejudging its findings, conclusions, and recommendations and to solicit and consider public comment, as the statute requires. As Chairman Frank described the compromise when he presented it to the committee, section 913 does not immediately impose any new duties on brokers, dealers and investment advisers nor does it mandate any particular duty or outcome, but it gives the SEC, subsequent to the conclusion of the study, the authority to conduct a rulemaking on the standard of care, including the authority to impose a fiduciary duty. I think this is a strong compromise between the House and Senate positions. This bill gives financial institutions, regulators and consumers the right tools to make good decisions, and it also provides the right tools to prevent another crisis like the one we recently experienced. Many of the bill's provisions, including those mentioned previously, have bipartisan support; in fact, many of the core ideas incorporated into the bill originated from my Republican colleagues. Critics of this legislation have said that it tackles the wrong problems, hurts small banks and businesses, and burdens struggling financial institutions. I appreciate those points of view, but feel very confident in saying we have taken specific steps to ensure that small banks and businesses are not negatively affected, to make it more difficult for firms to take dangerous risks, and to strike the right balance between regulation and flexibility. But the bottom line is this: the kind of free-wheeling, self-regulating, anything goes environment that we had before the crisis is simply not an option. There are certainly provisions in this bill that I would have written differently as any of my colleagues would if we wrote this legislation ourselves. But that is not how the Senate and our legislative system works, and overall I think this conference report is very strong legislation. I look forward to its passage. There is no doubt that after the President signs this bill into law, there will be an important focus on implementing this legislation correctly, as well as continued oversight by Congress of the agencies and covered financial institutions, and efforts at international coordination with our counterparts in other countries. It is also likely that there may need to be corrections and adjustments to the bill in the future. That said, passage of this bill is important to our nation's economic recovery, and we must get it to the President's desk. Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the conference agreement on financial services regulatory reform and specifically an issue in section 619 of title VI, known as the Volcker rule. The section's limitations on financial organizations that own a depository institution from investing or sponsoring in hedge funds or investments in private equity to 3 percent of an organization's assets, in the aggregate, references ``tier 1 capital.'' The term ``tier 1 capital'' is a concept currently applied strictly to banks and bank holding companies and consists of core capital, which includes equity capital and disclosed reserves. However, there are financial organizations subject to the Volcker rule's investment constraints that do not have a principal regulator that utilizes tier 1 capital measurements to determine an entity's financial strength. In order to ensure a level playing field with traditional banks, I would hope the appropriate regulators would determine a suitable equivalent of tier 1 capital to determine the investment limit, while still satisfying the intent of the Volcker rule. I ask the regulators to make certain that these types of financial organizations will be subject to the Volcker rule in a manner that takes into account their unique structure. In addition, I am pleased that as part of the conference report that the Volcker language was modified to permit a banking entity to engage in a certain level of traditional asset management business, including the ability to sponsor and offer hedge and private equity funds. With that in mind, I wanted to clarify certain details around this authority. First, I was pleased to see that the Volcker Rule, as modified, will permit banking entities several years to bring their full range of activities into conformance with the new rule. In particular, section 619(c)(2) ensures that the new investment restrictions under section 619(d)(1)(G)(iii) and section 619(d)(4)--including the numerical limitations under section 619(d)(4)(B)(ii)--will only apply to a banking entity at the end of the period that is 2 years after the section's effective date. This date for the regulators to begin applying the new rules can also be extended into the future for up to three 1-year periods under section 619(c)(2) and can also separately be extended for illiquid funds with contractual commitments as of May 1, 2010, under section 619(c)(3), on a one-time basis for up to 5 years. Only after all of these time periods and extensions have run will any of the limitations under section 619(d)(1)(G) and section 619(d)(4) be applied by regulators. Second, as an added protection, section 619(f) applies sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act to transactions between all of a banking entity's affiliates and hedge or private equity funds where the banking entity organizes, offers, serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, or sponsor of such funds under section 619(d). These restrictions are also applied to transactions between a banking entity's affiliates and other funds that are ``controlled'' by a hedge or private equity fund permitted for the banking entity under 619(d). Importantly, these 23A and 23B restrictions do not apply to funds not ``controlled'' by funds permitted for the banking entity under section 619(d), and it should also be clear that under section 619 there are no new restrictions or limitations of any type placed on the portfolio investments of any hedge or private equity fund permitted for a banking entity under section 619. Third, as a condition of sponsorship, section 619(d)(1)(G)(v) requires that a banking entity does not, directly or indirectly, guarantee or assume or otherwise insure the obligations or performance of any sponsored hedge or private equity fund or of any other hedge or private equity fund in which the sponsored fund invests. While this restricts guarantees by the banking entity as well as the insuring of obligation or performance, it does not limit other normal banking relations with funds merely due to a noncontrol investment by a fund sponsored by the banking entity. As described above, section 619(f) limits transactions under 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act with a fund ``controlled'' by the banking entity or a fund sponsored by the banking entity. However, 619(f) does not limit in any manner transactions and normal banking relationships with a fund not ``controlled'' by the banking entity or a fund sponsored by the banking entity. Finally, section 619(d)(4)(I) permits certain banking entities to operate hedge and private equity funds outside of the United States provided that no ownership interest in any hedge or private equity fund is offered for sale or sold to a U.S. resident. For consistency's sake, I would expect that, apart from the U.S. marketing restrictions, these provisions will be applied by the [[Page S5890]] regulators in conformity with and incorporating the Federal Reserve's current precedents, rulings, positions, and practices under sections 4(c)(9) and 4(c)(13) of the Bank Holding Company Act so as to provide greater certainty and utilize the established legal framework for funds operated by bank holding companies outside of the United States. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the Senator from Connecticut and congratulating him. He has been pretty effective in his last year in the Senate. He got a lot of stuff moving and a lot of stuff through. And I have not agreed with all of it, by the way. Most importantly, he has done it in a fair and balanced way, always with a sense of humor and an openness and willingness to listen to those with whom he may not agree entirely and allow us to participate at the table in discussions about the problems at the very beginning of the process in a very substantial way. So I thank him for his courtesy and for the way he runs the committee and the way he ran the HELP Committee when he succeeded to that leadership on the unfortunate passing of Senator Kennedy. It has been a pleasure to serve with him on this bill and on some very significant issues as we tried to work through them. I have reservations about this bill--they are more than reservations. I, obviously, believe the bill doesn't get us to where we need to go. When we started on this effort, our purpose was, in the beginning, twofold: First, we wanted to make sure we could do everything we could to build into the system of regulatory atmosphere and the marketplace the brakes and the ability to avoid another systemic meltdown of the type we had in late 2008, which was a traumatic event. Nobody should underestimate how significant the events of late 2008 were. If action had not been taken under the TARP proposal, and under the leadership of President Bush, Secretary Paulson, and then President Obama and Secretary Geithner, this country would have gone into a much more severe economic situation--probably a depression. Secretary Paulson once estimated the unemployment rate would have gone to 25 percent. The simple fact is the entire banking system would have probably imploded--most likely imploded--and certainly Main Street America would have been put in dire straits. But action was taken. It was difficult action. We are still hearing about the ramifications of it, but it was the right action, and it has led to a stabilization of the financial industry. But we never want to have to see that happen again. We never want to have to go through that type of trauma again as a nation, where our entire financial community is teetering. So the purpose of this bill should be to put in place a series of initiatives which will hopefully mute that type of potential for another event of a systemic meltdown. The second purpose of this bill--and it is an equally important purpose--is that we not do something that harms one of the unique strengths and characteristics of our Nation, where if you are an entrepreneur and have an idea and are willing to take a risk and try to create jobs, you can get credit and capital reasonably easily compared to the rest of the world. That has been the engine of the economic prosperity of our Nation--the availability of credit and capital, reasonably priced and reasonably available to entrepreneurs in our Nation. Those should have been our two goals. If we match this bill to those goals, does it meet the test of meeting those goals? Unfortunately, I don't think it does. There are some very positive things in the bill. The resolution authority is a good product in this bill, and it will, in my opinion--though I know there is a lot of discussion about this-- pretty much bring an end to the concept of too big to fail. If an institution gets overleveraged to a point where it is no longer sustainable, and it is a systemic risk institution, it is going to be collapsed. The stockholders will be wiped out, the unsecured bond holders will be wiped out, and the institution will be resolved under this bill. That is positive because we do not want to send to the markets a signal that the American taxpayer is going to stand behind institutions which are simply large. That perverts capital in the markets, and it perverts flow of economic activity in the markets when people think there is that sort of guarantee standing behind certain institutions in this country. And I think progress is made in this bill on the issue of resolution. But, unfortunately, in a number of other areas, the opportunity to do something constructive was not accomplished. In fact, in my opinion, there will be results from this bill which will cause us to see a negative effect from this bill. The most negative effects I think will occur from this bill lie in two areas. First, in the area of the formation of credit. It is very obvious that under this bill there is going to be a very significant contraction of credit in this country as we head into the next year, 2 years, maybe even 3 years. We are in a tough fiscal time right now. It is still very difficult on Main Street America to get credit. The economy is slow. We should not be passing a bill which is going to significantly dampen down credit, but it will. This bill will. It will for three reasons: First, the derivatives language in this bill is not well thought out. It just isn't. Most people don't understand what derivatives are, but let's describe them as the grease that gets credit going in this country and everywhere. It is basically insurance products that allow people to do business and make sure they can insure over the risks that they have in a business. This bill creates a new regime for how we handle derivatives in this country. Our goal should have been to make derivatives more transparent and sounder. That could have been done easily by making sure most derivatives were on over-the-counter exchanges--went through clearinghouses I mean, and had adequate margins behind them, adequate liquidity behind them, and were reported immediately to the credit reporting agencies as to what they were doing. It didn't involve a lot of complications, just changing the rules of the road. Instead of doing that, we have changed the entire process. In changing the entire process, we are basically going to contract significantly the availability of these products to basically fund and to be the engine or the grease or the lubricant for the ability of a lot of American businesses to do business. End users in this country who use derivatives are going to find it very hard to have an exemption. They are basically going to have to put up capital, put up margin--something they do not do today on commercial derivative products--and that is going to cause them to contract their business. They will have to contract their business or they are going to have to go overseas. Believe me, there is a vibrant market in derivatives overseas. They will go to London, and this business will end up offshore. Then we have this push to put everything on an exchange. Well, there are a lot of derivatives that obviously should go through clearinghouses but are too customized to go on exchanges, and we are going to end up inevitably with a contraction in the derivatives market as a result. Then we have the swap desk initiative, which was simply a punitive exercise, in my opinion. It is going to accomplish virtually nothing in the area of making the system sounder or more stable. But what it will do is move a large section of derivative activity--especially the CDS markets--offshore. They will go offshore because they will not be done here any longer. Banks and financial houses which historically have written these instruments are not going to put up the capital to write them because they don't get a return that makes it worth it to them. I guarantee we are going to see a massive contraction in a number of derivatives markets as a result of this swap desk initiative, which was more a political initiative than a substantive initiative, and which is counterproductive. It is a ``cut off your nose to spite your face'' initiative, and it will move overseas a lot of the products we do here and make it harder for Americans to be competitive--especially for financial services industries to be competitive--in the United States. So that will cause a contraction and a fairly big one. [[Page S5891]] The estimates are that the contraction may be as high as $\\3/4\\ trillion. That is a lot of credit taken out of the system. On top of that, there is the issue of the new capital rules in this bill. It isn't constructive for the Congress to set arbitrary capital rules. That should be left to the regulators. But this bill pretty much does that. As a result, a lot of the regional banks, the middle-sized banks--the larger banks would not be affected too much--will find they are under tremendous pressure as their tier I capital has to be restructured relative to trust preferred stock. This is not a good idea because, as a practical matter, we will again cause a contraction in the market of capital--of credit. As banks grow their capital, they will have to contract credit. When a bank has to get money back in order to build its capital position up, it doesn't go to its bad loans because the bad loans aren't performing. It goes to its good loans, and it doesn't lend to them. Or it says: We are going to draw down your line of credit, because that is where they can get capital. That is what will happen, and we will see capital contract there. On top of that, we have the Volcker rule. The concept is a very good idea. We should never have banks using insured deposits to do their proprietary activity. But straightening out what this Volcker rule means will take a while. It may be a year or two before anybody can sort out what it means and before the regulations come down that define it. So there will be a period of uncertainty, and that uncertainty means less credit available. Of course, this is another situation where the international banks are the winners and the domestic banks are the losers because the international banks will be able to go and do the same business--the proprietary trade--in London, if they are based in London or in Singapore, if they are based in Singapore or Tokyo, if they are based in Tokyo. But the American banks they compete with aren't going to be able to do it. So that makes no sense at all. But as a practical matter, that is what this bill does. So we will end up again with a tentativeness in the markets as to what they are supposed to be doing and what they can do in the area relative to the Volcker rule, and this will end up creating further credit contractions. So my guess is, when we add it all together, this bill will lead to a credit contraction of probably $1 trillion or more in our economy. What does that translate into? It translates into fewer jobs and less economic activity. It didn't have to happen this way. This could have been done in a way that would have been clearer, where the clarity would have been greater, and where we would not have had to take arbitrary action which was more political than substantive to address what problems in the industry did exist and should have been addressed. Another area of concern, of course, is this consumer agency. Consumer protection is critical. We all agree to that. What we proposed on our side of the aisle was that we link consumer protection and safety and soundness at the same level of responsibility and the same level of authority within the entire bank regulatory system so that the prudential regulator--whether it is the Fed or the Office of the Comptroller--when they go out to regulate a bank and check on it for safety and soundness--or the FDIC--they, at the same time, have the same standard of importance placed on making sure that the consumer is being protected in the way that bank deals with the consumers. That is the way it should be done. The two should be linked because the regulator that regulates the bank for safety and soundness is the logical regulator to regulate the bank to make sure it is complying with consumers' needs. But this bill sets up this brandnew agency, which it calls consumer protection, but it will not be at all, in my opinion. It will be the agency for political correctness or correcting political justice or issues of political justice that somebody is concerned about. It is totally independent of everybody else. It doesn't answer to anyone except on a very limited and narrow way to the systemic risk council. It is a single person with an $850 million unoversighted revenue stream with no appropriations. Basically, the person just gets the money and can go off and do whatever they want. There is no relationship between this person and the prudential regulator. So what we will have is an individual who may get on a cause of social justice and say that XYZ group isn't getting enough loans, and they go out to the banks and say: You have to send XYZ group more loans. We might have the bank regulator over here saying to the local banks, the regional banks: You can't lend to XYZ group because we know they are not going to pay you back or they will not pay you back at a rate that is reasonable. So we are going to have this inherent conflict. Now, what will be the result of that? The banks will probably have to lend to the XYZ group, which means the people borrowing from that bank who pay their loans back will have to pay more because the bank will have to make up for the loss of revenues. As a result, the cost of credit will go up, especially for individuals who are responsible and paying down their debts and paying for their credit--paying back their loans. We are going to end up with layers and layers of conflicting regulation which will cost the banking community money--a significant amount of unnecessary money. Who pays for that? Well, the consumer pays for it. Clearly, that gets passed through. This is one of those Rube Goldberg ideas that can only come out of a government entity. They used to say: You know, the government produces a camel when it is supposed to be producing a horse. There is just a disconnect between the reality of what we are supposed to be doing in the area of producing effective regulation relative to protecting consumers and what this bill ends up finally doing. I would not be here to oversee it or participate in it. In fact, nobody gets to oversee it, by the way. This consumer protection agency is not responsible to the Banking Committee of the Senate or the Banking Committee of the House. It is not responsible to the Fed. This person is a true czar. The term ``czar'' is thrown around here a lot, but this person is a true czar in the area of consumer activity. I suspect we will see that this agency becomes a very controversial agency, with a very political social justice type agenda, not an agenda which is aimed at primarily protecting consumers. So that is a big problem with this bill, and there are a lot of other issues with this bill. At the margin, the issue of how we restructure the regulatory regimes is of some concern, the whole question of how stockholders' rights in this bill--and probably not relevant to the banking issue so much--could have been improved on. The bill overall could have been a much better product. But the primary concern I have goes back to this issue of what was the original purpose--to protect systemic risk in the outyears and make sure we continue to have a strong and vibrant credit market for Americans who want to take risks and create jobs. Two major issues were totally ignored in the bill which would address that question: What drove the event of this meltdown? What caused this financial downturn? It was the real estate market and the way it was being lent into. Two things were the basic engines of that problem, that were government controlled. There were a lot of things which caused it, but the two things which the government controlled were, No. 1, underwriting standards. Basically we divorced underwriting standards from the issue of whether a person got a loan, so loans were being made on assets which could not cover the cost of the loan. It was presumed the asset was going to appreciate, a home was always going to appreciate in these communities and therefore they could loan at 100 percent of the value of the home or 105 percent of the value and still have a safe loan. That was a foolish assumption, to say the least. Second, we didn't look at whether the person could pay the loans back when these loans were made at zero interest for a year or 2 years. But then they reset, these loans reset at a fairly reasonable or sometimes very unreasonable interest rate and nobody looked at whether the person could pay them back. These loans were being made not for the purposes of actually recovering the [[Page S5892]] loans. That was not the reason these loans were being made. These subprime loans were being made because there were fees on the loans and the people making the loans were getting the fees. There was a whole cottage industry of people down in Miami who had just gotten out of prison who figured this out while they were in prison and they developed an entire cottage industry of former prisoners who had been released, legally, and actually went back into the loan business and were making these loans and getting the fees. Then what aggravated it--first what aggravated it was the underwriting standards, but then it was that these loans got securitized. They got picked up by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, with the understanding--it was implicit but it was obvious, as we found out-- that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would essentially insure these loans. So if you bought one of these securitized loans, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be standing behind it even though the loans were not viable. This bill ignores both those issues. It has very marginal language on the issue of underwriting. It doesn't get us back to standards which would basically protect us from overly aggressive underwriting. People say Canada did not have a problem, Australia didn't have a problem. Why didn't they have a problem? They didn't have a problem because they required people who were borrowing to put money down and they required that people who were borrowing actually be able to pay the money back. It seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to require, but this bill ignores it. Second, this bill does nothing about Fannie or Freddie--nothing. Talk about ignoring the elephant in the room, this is the whole herd of elephants in the room. The American taxpayer today is on the hook for something like $500 billion to $1 trillion. The estimates vary. Some people say it is even higher than that--the American taxpayer, for bad loans, securitized by Fannie and Freddie. This bill says nothing. It is as if this problem doesn't exist. It is as if this problem doesn't exist. Not only was it one of the primary drivers of the financial meltdown but it is one of the biggest problems we have going forward. The administration says we will do it next year. Well, if you do a financial reform bill without Fannie and Freddie, you essentially are not doing a financial reform bill at all. I apply the same to the issue of underwriting. In my opinion, this bill has some pluses. I know this was worked very hard and I admire the efforts of the Senator from Connecticut and actually the chairman in the House, Congressman Frank from Massachusetts. But the negatives of this bill unfortunately are too significant to ignore, especially in the area of the short-term credit contraction that is going to occur, the poorly structured derivatives language, the Consumer Protection Agency--which I think is going to end up being counterproductive to consumers--and the failure to take up the Freddie and Fannie issue, and the failure to do stronger underwriting standards. For that reason, I remain opposed to this bill. I understand it is going to pass. I hope some of my concerns do not come to fruition because, if they do, unfortunately this economy is going to be slowed and our Nation will be less viable economically. But I am afraid they will come to fruition. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Connecticut is recognized Mr. DODD. I see my other colleagues here, including Senator Specter who wants to be heard, but I want to address my colleague from New Hampshire because we are both going to be walking out of this Chamber in about 5 months. I thank him for his work going back to 20-some-odd months ago when we were involved in the critical weeks and days in September and October. Judd Gregg was invaluable putting together a moment here while, not terribly popular, I think saved the economy and the country. I will not address all his concerns here. We have a different point of view on the issues he raised. They are not illegitimate issues. We think we addressed them properly. He has a different view, and I respect that. I appreciate his work and that of his staff on this bill. He made a significant contribution to this effort and I thank him for it. I see my colleague from Pennsylvania here and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset I wish to ascertain with precision that I have 20 minutes, as had been arranged with the floor monitors. I had looked for 30 but I ask consent I may speak for up to 20 minutes now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I want to be clear so my colleague will understand this. I had a sheet of paper in front of me-- I do not have it in front of me now--with the order of those who sought time. I want to be careful, as my colleague from Pennsylvania will understand. We are going to vote at 2 o'clock. I want to be sure I can accommodate my colleagues. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes remains to the majority. Mr. DODD. I know Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget Committee, has to be heard and it is critical to me he be heard on the budget point of order. Could you make it a little less than 20? Mr. SPECTER. I really cannot. I had started at 30 and 20 is tough. How early might I return for my 30 minutes? Mr. DODD. After 2 o'clock? Any point after---- Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent I may have 30 minutes when the two votes which are scheduled for 2 o'clock conclude. Mr. DODD. Certainly I would have no objection to that whatsoever. Take some time at this juncture too, if you wish. Mr. SPECTER. I will do it all at once. I don't want to truncate it. I ask unanimous consent that I may have the floor for 30 minutes at the conclusion of the two votes scheduled for 2 o'clock. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DODD. Again, let me reserve the right to object. I see the minority wants to check on such a request. I have no objection myself but obviously that is a matter--in fairness to the minority, we want to let them know of such a request. Here we are eating up time right now. I see my friend from North Dakota here as well. I am deeply grateful to the chairman of the Budget Committee. Go ahead with that request. I am told it is OK. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and my colleague and the unknown persons in the cloakroom. Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and the unknown persons in the cloakroom. Let the record show they acknowledged the Senator's request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the budget point of order that has been raised against the financial reform conference report. I will be voting to waive this point of order. As Budget Committee chairman, I do not take this step lightly. In fact, the point of order that has been offered is a point of order that I created in the 2008 budget, so it is something I feel strongly about as a general matter. But its applicability here is false in the face of the importance of the legislation we need to consider. The legislation before us is critical to our economic strength. I think we all understand that financial reform is long overdue. It has been almost 2 years since the financial sector collapse brought our economy to the brink of global financial collapse. I was in the room and Senator Dodd was in the room when we were informed by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury in the previous administration that if we failed to act at that dire moment, we could face a global financial collapse. That is how serious it was. Now that the economy has stabilized, it is easy to forget the crisis that swept through the financial markets and threw us into the worst downturn since the Great Depression--in fact, which risked a second great depression. But we cannot afford to forget. We need to remember that the problems on Wall [[Page S5893]] Street and in our financial sector have a direct impact on Main Street and the lives of every American. We need to ensure that taxpayers are never again asked to bail out Wall Street. This financial reform legislation will prevent another financial sector collapse, or at least will help prevent it. I do not think any of us can say this will prevent any future collapse, but it is critically important to helping us prevent another collapse. It will allow the government to shut down firms that threaten to crater our economy and ensure that the financial industry, not taxpayers, is on the hook for any costs. It will rein in risky derivatives and other risky trading practices that undermined some of our largest financial institutions. It will help level the playing field for smaller banks and credit unions by cracking down on the risky practices of Wall Street and nonbank financial institutions that caused the financial crisis. I am grateful to Senator Dodd, the Banking Committee, and members of the conference for working with me to make certain that the final bill recognizes the special circumstances of community banks and credit unions in rural States such as mine. In particular, I appreciate the committee's modification to the lending limit standards. This is very important to farming communities across the country. The final bill also provides added flexibility for rural lenders in the new mortgage standards as well as provisions to improve interchange reform for smaller financial institutions. Finally, I am pleased the committee included a risk-focused deposit insurance fund assessment formula and modified risk retention requirements for high quality loans. Especially I thank Senator Dodd for his extraordinary leadership. What a final year in the Senate. What a remarkable legacy he is leaving. I think the annals of the Senate will show very few Senators have had a record of accomplishment that matches what Senator Dodd will have done in this year. With respect to the budget point of order that has been raised against the conference report, let me make a couple of general points. First, this budget violation is not significant enough to merit derailing this important legislation. Second, we must bear in mind the risks of failing to act. If we fail to protect against a future collapse and create an orderly process for dealing with giant insolvent financial institutions, it is inevitable that taxpayers will again at some future point be asked to bail out the financial sector and prevent a catastrophic financial collapse. If one measures on any scale the differences between the technical violation in this budget point of order against what would happen if this legislation fails, they cannot even be compared. I mean, it is a gnat against an elephant. So let's keep things in mind here. Second, we must bear in mind the risk of failing to act because that would burden taxpayers in a way far beyond anything we see with this budget point of order. None of us wants that. This bill is an insurance policy against an expensive future taxpayer bailout. The point of order that has been raised is the long-term deficit point of order, a point of order I established in the budget resolution of 2008. This point of order prohibits legislation that worsens the deficit by more than $5 billion in any of the four 10-year periods following 2019. CBO has determined that at least in one of those four 10-year periods, the conference report would exceed this threshold. But this is really just a timing issue caused by the new bipartisan resolution authority created by the bill. This is the new authority given to the government to wind down failing financial firms. Under the resolution authority, if a financial firm is about to collapse, the government will use the firm's assets to wind it down and put it out of business. If the firm's assets are insufficient, the government will temporarily borrow funds from the Treasury. The financial industry will then reimburse the government and the taxpayers for 100 percent of the cost. Again, 100 percent of the money will be paid back by the banks. So the net impact on the deficit is zero. Overall, the bill saves $3.2 billion over the first 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So while technically this budget point of order lies, if you pierce the veil and look at what really happens, this bill reduces the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan scorekeeper here in the Senate. Because there is a lag time for the government to collect this money from the financial industry, CBO scores the bill as increasing the deficit in some of the later decades. But all of that money will be paid back in ensuing years, and that is what matters most in this case. So although this bill does technically violate the long-term deficit point of order, it is insignificant. The fact is, this bill reduces the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So I urge my colleagues to waive the point of order, to support passage of this financial reform legislation, which is clearly a significant step in the right direction in preventing the kind of risk to our Nation's economy that is so apparent with the current structure. Again, I thank the chairman for his extraordinary work not only on this bill but throughout the year and, I think all of us know, throughout his career. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, leaves, let me thank him immensely for his analysis of this issue. He has it, as we saw as well, exactly right. In fact, it is not only repaying 100 percent but with interest. There is an interest requirement, that if we borrow from the taxpayers in order to wind down substantially risky firms, then not only do you get paid back, but the interest on the cost of that money is also part of the deal. So it is 100 percent-plus coming back to the Treasury. But his analysis and that of his committee--and there is no one who has been more disciplined or guarded about the budgetary process over the years we have served together, and so I appreciate the Senator's analysis of this particular point on the long-term deficit. I commend the Senator for including the provisions he has and trying to build some discipline into the process of how we expend taxpayer moneys, collect taxes in the first place to pay for the needed expenditures of our government. So I thank the Senator for that. I thank him for his comments as well about the bill and his support and also the substantive contributions the Senator from North Dakota has made, because one of the things we tried to be very careful about-- Jon Tester of Montana, who sits on the committee with me, has been very careful and been tremendously active in seeing to it that rural America is going to be well served by this legislation. And there are differences. It is not all Wall Street, New York, and major financial centers. The importance of the availability of credit in rural communities is critical, as my colleague from North Dakota has informed me over the years we have served together. That ability of a local farmer to borrow that money in the spring, to be able to pay back in the fall, at harvest time, has been essential, and knowing how difficult it has been throughout the country to have access to credit is essential. So his contributions to the legislation make sure that what we do here is going to enhance the capability of rural America to not only come out of this crisis we are in but to prosper in the years ahead with this legislation. So beyond the budgetary considerations and the points of order before us, I thank him for his contributions to the substance of the bill, which has made it a far better bill to begin with. I see my colleague from Oregon is here. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Dodd for yielding to me and for his leadership on financial reform. I yield to Senator Levin. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Merkley and I, as the principal authors of sections 619, 620, and 621 of the Dodd-Frank Act, thought it might be helpful to explain in some detail those sections, which are based on our bill, S. 3098, called the Protect Our Recovery [[Page S5894]] Through Oversight of Proprietary, PROP, Trading Act of 2010, and the subsequently filed Merkley-Levin Amendment, No. 4101, to the Dodd- Lincoln substitute, which was the basis of the provision adopted by the Conference Committee. I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Merkley. Mr. MERKLEY. I thank Senator Levin and will be setting forth here our joint explanation of the Merkley-Levin provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Sections 619, 620 and 621 do three things: prohibit high-risk proprietary trading at banks, limit the systemic risk of such activities at systemically significant nonbank financial companies, and prohibit material conflicts of interest in asset-backed securitizations. Sections 619 and 620 amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to broadly prohibit proprietary trading, while nevertheless permitting certain activities that may technically fall within the definition of proprietary trading but which are, in fact, safer, client-oriented financial services. To account for the additional risk of proprietary trading among systemically critical financial firms that are not banks, bank holding companies, or the like, the sections require nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, the ``Board'', to keep additional capital for their proprietary trading activities and subject them to quantitative limits on those activities. In addition, given the unique control that firms who package and sell asset-backed securities (including synthetic asset-backed securities) have over transactions involving those securities, section 621 protects purchasers by prohibiting those firms from engaging in transactions that involve or result in material conflicts of interest. First, it is important to remind our colleagues how the financial crisis of the past several years came to pass. Beginning in the 1980's, new financial products and significant amounts of deregulation undermined the Glass-Steagall Act's separation of commercial banking from securities brokerage or ``investment banking'' that had kept our banking system relatively safe since 1933. Over time, commercial and investment banks increasingly relied on precarious short term funding sources, while at the same time significantly increasing their leverage. It was as if our banks and securities firms, in competing against one another, were race car drivers taking the curves ever more tightly and at ever faster speeds. Meanwhile, to match their short-term funding sources, commercial and investment banks drove into increasingly risky, short-term, and sometimes theoretically hedged, proprietary trading. When markets took unexpected turns, such as when Russia defaulted on its debt and when the U.S. mortgage-backed securities market collapsed, liquidity evaporated, and financial firms became insolvent very rapidly. No amount of capital could provide a sufficient buffer in such situations. In the face of the worst financial crisis in 60 years, the January 2009 report by the Group of 30, an international group of financial experts, placed blame squarely on proprietary trading. This report, largely authored by former Federal Reserve System Chairman Paul Volcker, recommended prohibiting systemically critical banking institutions from trading in securities and other products for their own accounts. In January 2010, President Barack Obama gave his full support to common-sense restrictions on proprietary trading and fund investing, which he coined the ``Volcker Rule.'' The ``Volcker Rule,'' which Senator Levin and I drafted and have championed in the Senate, and which is embodied in section 619, embraces the spirit of the Glass-Steagall Act's separation of ``commercial'' from ``investment'' banking by restoring a protective barrier around our critical financial infrastructure. It covers not simply securities, but also derivatives and other financial products. It applies not only to banks, but also to nonbank financial firms whose size and function render them systemically significant. While the intent of section 619 is to restore the purpose of the Glass-Steagall barrier between commercial and investment banks, we also update that barrier to reflect the modern financial world and permit a broad array of low-risk, client-oriented financial services. As a result, the barrier constructed in section 619 will not restrict most financial firms. Section 619 is intended to limit proprietary trading by banking entities and systemically significant nonbank financial companies. Properly implemented, section 619's limits will tamp down on the risk to the system arising from firms competing to obtain greater and greater returns by increasing the size, leverage, and riskiness of their trades. This is a critical part of ending too big to fail financial firms. In addition, section 619 seeks to reorient the U.S. banking system away from leveraged, short-term speculation and instead towards the safe and sound provision of long-term credit to families and business enterprises. We recognize that regulators are essential partners in the legislative process. Because regulatory interpretation is so critical to the success of the rule, we will now set forth, as the principal authors of Sections 619 to 621, our explanations of how these provisions work. Section 619's prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading are set forth in a new section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and subsection (a), paragraph (1) establishes the basic principle clearly: a banking entity shall not ``engage in proprietary trading'' or ``acquire or retain . . . ownership interest[s] in or sponsor a hedge fund or private equity fund'', unless otherwise provided in the section. Paragraph (2) establishes the principle for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board by subjecting their proprietary trading activities to quantitative restrictions and additional capital charges. Such quantitative limits and capital charges are to be set by the regulators to address risks similar to those which lead to the flat prohibition for banking entities. Subsection (h), paragraph (1) defines ``banking entity'' to be any insured depository institution (as otherwise defined under the Bank Holding Company Act), any entity that controls an insured depository institution, any entity that is treated as a bank holding company under section 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978, and any affiliates or subsidiaries of such entities. We and the Congress specifically rejected proposals to exclude the affiliates and subsidiaries of bank holding companies and insured depository institutions, because it was obvious that restricting a bank, but not its affiliates and subsidiaries, would ultimately be ineffective in restraining the type of high-risk proprietary trading that can undermine an insured depository institution. The provision recognizes the modern reality that it is difficult to separate the fate of a bank and its bank holding company, and that for the bank holding company to be a source of strength to the bank, its activities, and those of its other subsidiaries and affiliates, cannot be at such great risk as to imperil the bank. We also note that not all banks pose the same risks. Accordingly, the paragraph provides a narrow exception for insured depository institutions that function principally for trust purposes and do not hold public depositor money, make loans, or access Federal Reserve lending or payment services. These specialized entities that offer very limited trust services are elsewhere carved out of the definition of ``bank,'' so we do not treat them as banks for the purposes of the restriction on proprietary trading. However, such institutions are covered by the restriction if they qualify under the provisions covering systemically important nonbank financial companies. Subsection (h), paragraph (3) defines nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board to be those financial companies whose size, interconnectedness, or core functions are of sufficiently systemic significance as to warrant additional supervision, as directed by the Financial Stability Oversight Council pursuant to Title I of the Dodd- Frank Act. Given the varied nature of such nonbank financial companies, for some of which proprietary trading is effectively their business, an outright statutory prohibition on such trading was not warranted. Instead, the risks posed by their proprietary trading is addressed through robust capital charges and quantitative limits that increase with the size, interconnectedness, and systemic importance of the [[Page S5895]] business functions of the nonbank financial firm. These restrictions should become stricter as size, leverage, and other factors increase. As with banking entities, these restrictions should also help reduce the size and risk of these financial firms. Naturally, the definition of ``proprietary trading'' is critical to the provision. For the purposes of section 13, proprietary trading means ``engaging as a principal for the trading account'' in transactions to ``purchase or sell, or otherwise acquire or dispose of'' a wide range of traded financial products, including securities, derivatives, futures, and options. There are essentially three key elements to the definition: (1) the firm must be acting ``as a principal,'' (2) the trading must be in its ``trading account'' or another similar account, and (3) the restrictions apply to the full range of its financial instruments. Purchasing or selling ``as a principal'' refers to when the firm purchases or sells the relevant financial instrument for its own account. The prohibition on proprietary trading does not cover trading engaged with exclusively client funds. The term ``trading account'' is intended to cover an account used by a firm to make profits from relatively short-term trading positions, as opposed to long-term, multi-year investments. The administration's proposed Volcker Rule focused on short-term trading, using the phrase ``trading book'' to capture that concept. That phrase, which is currently used by some bank regulators was rejected, however, and the ultimate conference report language uses the term ``trading account'' rather than ``trading book'' to ensure that all types of accounts used for proprietary trading are covered by the section. To ensure broad coverage of the prohibition on proprietary trading, paragraph (3) of subsection (h) defines ``trading account'' as any account used ``principally for the purpose of selling in the near term (or otherwise with the intent to resell in order to profit from short- term price movements)'' and such other accounts as the regulators determine are properly covered by the provision to fulfill the purposes of the section. In designing this definition, we were aware of bank regulatory capital rules that distinguish between short-term trading and long-term investments, and our overall focus was to restrict high- risk proprietary trading. For banking entity subsidiaries that do not maintain a distinction between a trading account and an investment account, all accounts should be presumed to be trading accounts and covered by the restriction. Linking the prohibition on proprietary trading to trading accounts permits banking entities to hold debt securities and other financial instruments in long-term investment portfolios. Such investments should be maintained with the appropriate capital charges and held for longer periods. The definition of proprietary trading in paragraph (4) covers a wide range of financial instruments, including securities, commodities, futures, options, derivatives, and any similar financial instruments. Pursuant to the rule of construction in subsection (g), paragraph (2), the definition should not generally include loans sold in the process of securitizing; however, it could include such loans if such loans become financial instruments traded to capture the change in their market value. Limiting the definition of proprietary trading to near-term holdings has the advantage of permitting banking entities to continue to deploy credit via long-term capital market debt instruments. However, it has the disadvantage of failing to prevent the problems created by longer- term holdings in riskier financial instruments, for example, highly complex collateralized debt obligations and other opaque instruments that are not readily marketable. To address the risks to the banking system arising from those longer-term instruments and related trading, section 620 directs Federal banking regulators to sift through the assets, trading strategies, and other investments of banking entities to identify assets or activities that pose unacceptable risks to banks, even when held in longer-term accounts. Regulators are expected to apply the lessons of that analysis to tighten the range of investments and activities permissible for banking entities, whether they are at the insured depository institution or at an affiliate or subsidiary, and whether they are short or long term in nature. The new Bank Holding Company Act section 13 also restricts investing in or sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. Clearly, if a financial firm were able to structure its proprietary positions simply as an investment in a hedge fund or private equity fund, the prohibition on proprietary trading would be easily avoided, and the risks to the firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates would continue. A financial institution that sponsors or manages a hedge fund or private equity fund also incurs significant risk even when it does not invest in the fund it manages or sponsors. Although piercing the corporate veil between a fund and its sponsoring entity may be difficult, recent history demonstrates that a financial firm will often feel compelled by reputational demands and relationship preservation concerns to bail out clients in a failed fund that it managed or sponsored, rather than risk litigation or lost business. Knowledge of such concerns creates a moral hazard among clients, attracting investment into managed or sponsored funds on the assumption that the sponsoring bank or systemically significant firm will rescue them if markets turn south, as was done by a number of firms during the 2008 crisis. That is why setting limits on involvement in hedge funds and private equity funds is critical to protecting against risks arising from asset management services. Subsection (h), paragraph (2) sets forth a broad definition of hedge fund and private equity fund, not distinguishing between the two. The definition includes any company that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, but is excluded from such coverage by the provisions of sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7). Although market practice in many cases distinguishes between hedge funds, which tend to be trading vehicles, and private equity funds, which tend to own entire companies, both types of funds can engage in high risk activities and it is exceedingly difficult to limit those risks by focusing on only one type of entity. Despite the broad prohibition on proprietary trading set forth in subsection (a), the legislation recognizes that there are a number of low-risk proprietary activities that do not pose unreasonable risks and explicitly permits those activities to occur. Those low-risk proprietary trading activities are identified in subsection (d), paragraph (1), subject to certain limitations set forth in paragraph (2), and additional capital charges required in paragraph (3). While paragraph (1) authorizes several permitted activities, it simultaneously grants regulators broad authority to set further restrictions on any of those activities and to supplement the additional capital charges provided for by paragraph (3). Subparagraph (d)(1)(A) authorizes the purchase or sale of government obligations, including government-sponsored enterprise, GSE, obligations, on the grounds that such products are used as low-risk, short-term liquidity positions and as low-risk collateral in a wide range of transactions, and so are appropriately retained in a trading account. Allowing trading in a broad range of GSE obligations is also meant to recognize a market reality that removing the use of these securities as liquidity and collateral positions would have significant market implications, including negative implications for the housing and farm credit markets. By authorizing trading in GSE obligations, the language is not meant to imply a view as to GSE operations or structure over the long-term, and permits regulators to add restrictions on this permitted activity as necessary to prevent high-risk proprietary trading activities under paragraph (2). When GSE reform occurs, we expect these provisions to be adjusted accordingly. Moreover, as is the case with all permitted activities under paragraph (1), regulators are expected to apply additional capital restrictions under paragraph (3) as necessary to account for the risks of the trading activities. Subparagraph (d)(1)(B) permits underwriting and market-making-related [[Page S5896]] transactions that are technically trading for the account of the firm but, in fact, facilitate the provision of near-term client-oriented financial services. Market-making is a customer service whereby a firm assists its customers by providing two-sided markets for speedy acquisition or disposition of certain financial instruments. Done properly, it is not a speculative enterprise, and revenues for the firm should largely arise from the provision of credit provided, and not from the capital gain earned on the change in the price of instruments held in the firm's accounts. Academic literature sets out the distinctions between making markets for customers and holding speculative positions in assets, but in general, the two types of trading are distinguishable by the volume of trading, the size of the positions, the length of time that positions remains open, and the volatility of profits and losses, among other factors. Regulations implementing this permitted activity should focus on these types of factors to assist regulators in distinguishing between financial firms assisting their clients versus those engaged in proprietary trading. Vigorous and robust regulatory oversight of this issue will be essential to the prevent ``market-making'' from being used as a loophole in the ban on proprietary trading. The administration's draft language, the original section 619 contemplated by the Senate Banking Committee, and amendment 4101 each included the term ``in facilitation of customer relations'' as a permitted activity. The term was removed in the final version of the Dodd-Frank Act out of concern that this phrase was too subjective, ambiguous, and susceptible to abuse. At the same time, we recognize that the term was previously included to permit certain legitimate client-oriented services, such pre-market-making accumulation of small positions that might not rise to the level of fully ``market-making'' in a security or financial instrument, but are intended to nonetheless meet expected near-term client liquidity needs. Accordingly, while previous versions of the legislation referenced ``market-making'', the final version references ``market-making-related'' to provide the regulators with limited additional flexibility to incorporate those types of transactions to meet client needs, without unduly warping the common understanding of market-making. We note, however, that ``market-making-related'' is not a term whose definition is without limits. It does not implicitly cover every time a firm buys an existing financial instrument with the intent to later sell it, nor does it cover situations in which a firm creates or underwrites a new security with the intent to market it to a client. Testimony by Goldman Sachs Chairman Lloyd Blankfein and other Goldman executives during a hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations seemed to suggest that any time the firm created a new mortgage related security and began soliciting clients to buy it, the firm was ``making a market'' for the security. But one-sided marketing or selling securities is not equivalent to providing a two-sided market for clients buying and selling existing securities. The reality was that Goldman Sachs was creating new securities for sale to clients and building large speculative positions in high-risk instruments, including credit default swaps. Such speculative activities are the essence of proprietary trading and cannot be properly considered within the coverage of the terms ``market-making'' or ``market-making- related.'' The subparagraph also specifically limits such underwriting and market-making-related activities to ``reasonably expected near term demands of clients, customers, and counterparties.'' Essentially, the subparagraph creates two restrictions, one on the expected holding period and one on the intent of the holding. These two restrictions greatly limit the types of risks and returns for market-makers. Generally, the revenues for market-making by the covered firms should be made from the fees charged for providing a ready, two-sided market for financial instruments, and not from the changes in prices acquired and sold by the financial institution. The ``near term'' requirement connects to the provision in the definition of trading account whereby the account is defined as trading assets that are acquired ``principally for the purpose of selling in the near term.'' The intent is to focus firms on genuinely making markets for clients, and not taking speculative positions with the firm's capital. Put simply, a firm will not satisfy this requirement by acquiring a position on the hope that the position will be able to be sold at some unknown future date for a trading profit. Subparagraph (d)(1)(C) permits a banking entity to engage in ``risk- mitigating hedging activities in connection with and related to individual or aggregated positions, contracts, or other holdings of the banking entity that are designed to reduce the specific risks to the banking entity in connection with and related to such positions, contracts, or other holdings.'' This activity is permitted because its sole purpose is to lower risk. While this subparagraph is intended to permit banking entities to utilize their trading accounts to hedge, the phrase ``in connection with and related to individual or aggregated positions . . .'' was added between amendment 4101 and the final version in the conference report in order to ensure that the hedge applied to specific, identifiable assets, whether it be on an individual or aggregate basis. Moreover, hedges must be to reduce ``specific risks'' to the banking entity arising from these positions. This formulation is meant to focus banking entities on traditional hedges and prevent proprietary speculation under the guise of general ``hedging.'' For example, for a bank with a significant set of loans to a foreign country, a foreign exchange swap may be an appropriate hedging strategy. On the other hand, purchasing commodity futures to ``hedge'' inflation risks that may generally impact the banking entity may be nothing more than proprietary trading under another name. Distinguishing between true hedges and covert proprietary trades may be one of the more challenging areas for regulators, and will require clear identification by financial firms of the specific assets and risks being hedged, research and analysis of market best practices, and reasonable regulatory judgment calls. Vigorous and robust regulatory oversight of this issue will be essential to the prevent ``hedging'' from being used as a loophole in the ban on proprietary trading. Subparagraph (d)(1)(D) permits the acquisition of the securities and other affected financial instruments ``on behalf of customers.'' This permitted activity is intended to allow financial firms to use firm funds to purchase assets on behalf of their clients, rather than on behalf of themselves. This subparagraph is intended, in particular, to provide reassurance that trading in ``street name'' for customers or in trust for customers is permitted. In general, subparagraph (d)(1)(E) provides exceptions to the prohibition on investing in hedge funds or private equity funds, if such investments advance a ``public welfare'' purpose. It permits investments in small business investment companies, which are a form of regulated venture capital fund in which banks have a long history of successful participation. The subparagraph also permits investments ``of the type'' permitted under the paragraph of the National Bank Act enabling banks to invest in a range of low-income community development and other projects. The subparagraph also specifically mentions tax credits for historical building rehabilitation administered by the National Park Service, but is flexible enough to permit the regulators to include other similar low-risk investments with a public welfare purpose. Subparagraph (d)(1)(F) is meant to accommodate the normal business of insurance at regulated insurance companies that are affiliated with banks. The Volcker Rule was never meant to affect the ordinary business of insurance: the collection and investment of premiums, which are then used to satisfy claims of the insured. These activities, while definitionally proprietary trading, are heavily regulated by State insurance regulators, and in most cases do not pose the same level of risk as other proprietary trading. However, to prevent abuse, firms seeking to rely on this insurance- related exception must meet two essential qualifications. First, only trading for the general account of the insurance firm would qualify. Second, the [[Page S5897]] trading must be subject to adequate State-level insurance regulation. Trading by insurance companies or their affiliates that is not subject to insurance company investment regulations will not qualify for protection here. Further, where State laws and regulations do not exist or otherwise fail to appropriately connect the insurance company investments to the actual business of insurance or are found to inadequately protect the firm, the subparagraph's conditions will not be met. Subparagraph (d)(1)(G) permits firms to organize and offer hedge funds or private equity funds as an asset management service to clients. It is important to remember that nothing in section 619 otherwise prohibits a bank from serving as an investment adviser to an independent hedge fund or private equity fund. Yet, to serve in that capacity, a number of criteria must be met. First, the firm must be doing so pursuant to its provision of bona fide trust, fiduciary, or investment advisory services to customers. Given the fiduciary obligations that come with such services, these requirements ensure that banking entities are properly engaged in responsible forms of asset management, which should tamp down on the risks taken by the relevant fund. Second, subparagraph (d)(1)(G) provides strong protections against a firm bailing out its funds. Clause (iv) prohibits banking entities, as provided under paragraph (1) and (2) of subsection (f), from entering into lending or similar transactions with related funds, and clause (v) prohibits banking entities from ``directly or indirectly, guarantee[ing], assum[ing], or otherwise insur[ing] the obligations or performance of the hedge fund or private equity fund.'' To prevent banking entities from engaging in backdoor bailouts of their invested funds, clause (v) extends to the hedge funds and private equity funds in which such subparagraph (G) hedge funds and private equity funds invest. Third, to prevent a banking entity from having an incentive to bailout its funds and also to limit conflicts of interest, clause (vii) of subparagraph (G) restricts directors and employees of a banking entity from being invested in hedge funds and private equity funds organized and offered by the banking entity, except for directors or employees ``directly engaged'' in offering investment advisory or other services to the hedge fund or private equity fund. Fund managers can have ``skin in the game'' for the hedge fund or private equity fund they run, but to prevent the bank from running its general employee compensation through the hedge fund or private equity fund, other management and employees may not. Fourth, by stating that a firm may not organize and offer a hedge fund or private equity fund with the firm's name on it, clause (vi) of subparagraph (G) further restores market discipline and supports the restriction on firms bailing out funds on the grounds of reputational risk. Similarly, clause (viii) ensures that investors recognize that the funds are subject to market discipline by requiring that funds provide prominent disclosure that any losses of a hedge fund or private equity fund are borne by investors and not by the firm, and the firm must also comply with any other restrictions to ensure that investors do not rely on the firm, including any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, for a bailout. Fifth, the firm or its affiliates cannot make or maintain an investment interest in the fund, except in compliance with the limited fund seeding and alignment of interest provisions provided in paragraph (4) of subsection (d). This paragraph allows a firm, for the limited purpose of maintaining an investment management business, to seed a new fund or make and maintain a ``de minimis'' co-investment in a hedge fund or private equity fund to align the interests of the fund managers and the clients, subject to several conditions. As a general rule, firms taking advantage of this provision should maintain only small seed funds, likely to be $5 to $10 million or less. Large funds or funds that are not effectively marketed to investors would be evasions of the restrictions of this section. Similarly, co-investments designed to align the firm with its clients must not be excessive, and should not allow for firms to evade the intent of the restrictions of this section. These ``de minimis'' investments are to be greatly disfavored, and subject to several significant restrictions. First, a firm may only have, in the aggregate, an immaterial amount of capital in such funds, but in no circumstance may such positions aggregate to more than 3 percent of the firm's Tier 1 capital. Second, by one year after the date of establishment for any fund, the firm must have not more than a 3 percent ownership interest. Third, investments in hedge funds and private equity funds shall be deducted on, at a minimum, a one-to-one basis from capital. As the leverage of a fund increases, the capital charges shall be increased to reflect the greater risk of loss. This is specifically intended to discourage these high-risk investments, and should be used to limit these investments to the size only necessary to facilitate asset management businesses for clients. Subparagraphs (H) and (I) recognize rules of international regulatory comity by permitting foreign banks, regulated and backed by foreign taxpayers, in the course of operating outside of the United States to engage in activities permitted under relevant foreign law. However, these subparagraphs are not intended to permit a U.S. banking entity to avoid the restrictions on proprietary trading simply by setting up an offshore subsidiary or reincorporating offshore, and regulators should enforce them accordingly. In addition, the subparagraphs seek to maintain a level playing field by prohibiting a foreign bank from improperly offering its hedge fund and private equity fund services to U.S. persons when such offering could not be made in the United States. Subparagraph (J) permits the regulators to add additional exceptions as necessary to ``promote and protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States.'' This general exception power is intended to ensure that some unforeseen, low-risk activity is not inadvertently swept in by the prohibition on proprietary trading. However, the subparagraph sets an extremely high bar: the activity must be necessary to promote and protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States, and not simply pose a competitive disadvantage or a threat to firms' profitability. Paragraph (2) of section (d) adds explicit statutory limits to the permitted activities under paragraph (1). Specifically, it prevents an activity from qualifying as a permitted activity if it would ``involve or result in a material conflict of interest,'' ``result directly or indirectly in a material exposure . . . to high-risk assets or high- risk trading strategies'' or otherwise pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the firm or the financial stability of the United States. Regulators are directed to define the key terms in the paragraph and implement the restrictions as part of the rulemaking process. Regulators should pay particular attention to the hedge funds and private equity funds organized and offered under subparagraph (G) to ensure that such activities have sufficient distance from other parts of the firm, especially those with windows into the trading flow of other clients. Hedging activities should also be particularly scrutinized to ensure that information about client trading is not improperly utilized. The limitation on proprietary trading activities that ``involve or result in a material conflict of interest'' is a companion to the conflicts of interest prohibition in section 621, but applies to all types of activities rather than just asset-backed securitizations. With respect to the definition of high-risk assets and high-risk trading strategies, regulators should pay close attention to the characteristics of assets and trading strategies that have contributed to substantial financial loss, bank failures, bankruptcies, or the collapse of financial firms or financial markets in the past, including but not limited to the crisis of 2008 and the financial crisis of 1998. In assessing high-risk assets and high-risk trading strategies, particular attention should be paid to the transparency of the markets, the availability of consistent pricing information, the depth of the markets, and the risk characteristics [[Page S5898]] of the assets and strategies themselves, including any embedded leverage. Further, these characteristics should be evaluated in times of extreme market stress, such as those experienced recently. With respect to trading strategies, attention should be paid to the role that certain types of trading strategies play in times of relative market calm, as well as times of extreme market stress. While investment advisors may freely deploy high-risk strategies for their clients, attention should be paid to ensure that firms do not utilize them for their own proprietary activities. Barring high risk strategies may be particularly critical when policing market-making-related and hedging activities, as well as trading otherwise permitted under subparagraph (d)(1)(A). In this context, however, it is irrelevant whether or not a firm provides market liquidity: high-risk assets and high-risk trading strategies are never permitted. Subsection (d), paragraph (3) directs the regulators to set appropriate additional capital charges and quantitative limits for permitted activities. These restrictions apply to both banking entities and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board. It is left to regulators to determine if those restrictions should apply equally to both, or whether there may appropriately be a distinction between banking entities and non-bank financial companies supervised by the Board. The paragraph also mandates diversification requirements where appropriate, for example, to ensure that banking entities do not deploy their entire permitted amount of de minimis investments into a small number of hedge funds or private equity funds, or that they dangerously over-concentrate in specific products or types of financial products. Subsection (e) provides vigorous anti-evasion authority, including record-keeping requirements. This authority is designed to allow regulators to appropriately assess the trading of firms, and aggressively enforce the text and intent of section 619. The restrictions on proprietary trading and relationships with private funds seek to break the internal connection between a bank's balance sheet and taking risk in the markets, with a view towards reestablishing market discipline and refocusing the bank on its credit extension function and client services. In the recent financial crisis, when funds advised by banks suffered significant losses, those off- balance sheet funds came back onto the banks' balance sheets. At times, the banks bailed out the funds because the investors in the funds had other important business with the banks. In some cases, the investors were also key personnel at the banks. Regardless of the motivations, in far too many cases, the banks that bailed out their funds ultimately relied on taxpayers to bail them out. It is precisely for this reason that the permitted activities under subparagraph (d)(1)(G) are so narrowly defined. Indeed, a large part of protecting firms from bailing out their affiliated funds is by limiting the lending, asset purchases and sales, derivatives trading, and other relationships that a banking entity or nonbank financial company supervised by the Board may maintain with the hedge funds and private equity funds it advises. The relationships that a banking entity maintains with and services it furnishes to its advised funds can provide reasons why and the means through which a firm will bail out an advised fund, be it through a direct loan, an asset acquisition, or through writing a derivative. Further, providing advisory services to a hedge fund or private equity fund creates a conflict of interest and risk because when a banking entity is itself determining the investment strategy of a fund, it no longer can make a fully independent credit evaluation of the hedge fund or private equity fund borrower. These bailout protections will significantly benefit independent hedge funds and private equity funds, and also improve U.S. financial stability. Accordingly, subsection (f), paragraph (1) sets forth the broad prohibition on a banking entity entering into any ``covered transactions'' as such term is defined in the Federal Reserve Act's section 23A, as if such banking entity were a member bank and the fund were an affiliate thereof. ``Covered transactions'' under section 23A includes loans, asset purchases, and, following the Dodd-Frank bill adoption, derivatives between the member bank and the affiliate. In general, section 23A sets limits on the extension of credit between such entities, but paragraph (1) of subsection (f) prohibits all such transactions. It also prohibits transactions with funds that are controlled by the advised or sponsored fund. In short, if a banking entity organizes and offers a hedge fund or private equity fund or serves as investment advisor, manager, or sponsor of a fund, the fund must seek credit, including from asset purchases and derivatives, from an independent third party. Subsection (f), paragraph (2) applies section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act to a banking entity and its advised or sponsored hedge fund or private equity fund. This provides, inter alia, that transactions between a banking entity and its fund be conducted at arms length. The fact that section 23B also includes the provision of covered transactions under section 23A as part of its arms-length requirement should not be interpreted to undermine the strict prohibition on such transactions in paragraph (1). Subsection (f), paragraph (3) permits the Board to allow a very limited exception to paragraph (1) for the provision of certain limited services under the rubric of ``prime brokerage'' between the banking entity and a third-party-advised fund in which the fund managed, sponsored, or advised by the banking entity has taken an ownership interest. Essentially, it was argued that a banking entity should not be prohibited, under proper restrictions, from providing limited services to unaffiliated funds, but in which its own advised fund may invest. Accordingly, paragraph (3) is intended to only cover third- party funds, and should not be used as a means of evading the general prohibition provided in paragraph (1). Put simply, a firm may not create tiered structures and rely upon paragraph (3) to provide these types of services to funds for which it serves as investment advisor. Further, in recognition of the risks that are created by allowing for these services to unaffiliated funds, several additional criteria must also be met for the banking entity to take advantage of this exception. Most notably, on top of the flat prohibitions on bailouts, the statute requires the chief executive officer of firms taking advantage of this paragraph to also certify that these services are not used directly or indirectly to bail out a fund advised by the firm. Subsection (f), paragraph (4) requires the regulatory agencies to apply additional capital charges and other restrictions to systemically significant nonbank financial institutions to account for the risks and conflicts of interest that are addressed by the prohibitions for banking entities. Such capital charges and other restrictions should be sufficiently rigorous to account for the significant amount of risks associated with these activities. To give markets and firms an opportunity to adjust, implementation of section 620 will proceed over a period of several years. First, pursuant to subsection (b), paragraph (1), the Financial Stability Oversight Council will conduct a study to examine the most effective means of implementing the rule. Then, under paragraph (b)(2), the Federal banking agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall each engage in rulemakings for their regulated entities, with the rulemaking coordinated for consistency through the Financial Stability Oversight Council. In coordinating the rulemaking, the Council should strive to avoid a ``lowest common denominator'' framework, and instead apply the best, most rigorous practice from each regulatory agency. Pursuant to subsection (c), paragraph (1), most provisions of section 619 become effective 12 months after the issuance of final rules pursuant to subsection (b), but in no case later than 2 years after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Paragraph (c)(2) provides a 2-year period following effective date of the provision during which entities must bring their activities into conformity with the law, which may be extended for up to 3 more years. Special illiquid funds may, if necessary, receive one 5-year extension and may [[Page S5899]] also continue to honor certain contractual commitments during the transition period. The purpose of this extended wind-down period is to minimize market disruption while still steadily moving firms away from the risks of the restricted activities. The definition of ``illiquid funds'' set forth in subsection (h) paragraph (7) is meant to cover, in general, very illiquid private equity funds that have deployed capital to illiquid assets such as portfolio companies and real estate with a projected investment holding period of several years. The Board, in consultation with the SEC, should therefore adopt rules to define the contours of an illiquid fund as appropriate to capture the intent of the provision. To facilitate certainty in the market with respect to divestiture, the Board is to conduct a special expedited rulemaking regarding these conformance and wind-down periods. The Board is also to set capital rules and any additional restrictions to protect the banking entities and the U.S. financial system during this wind-down period. We noted above that the purpose of section 620 is to review the long- term investments and other activities of banks. The concerns reflected in this section arise out of losses that have appeared in the long-term investment portfolios in traditional depository institutions. Over time, various banking regulators have displayed expansive views and conflicting judgments about permissible investments for banking entities. Some of these activities, including particular trading strategies and investment assets, pose significant risks. While section 619 provides numerous restrictions to proprietary trading and relationships to hedge funds and private equity funds, it does not seek to significantly alter the traditional business of banking. Section 620 is an attempt to reevaluate banking assets and strategies and see what types of restrictions are most appropriate. The Federal banking agencies should closely review the risks contained in the types of assets retained in the investment portfolio of depository institutions, as well as risks in affiliates' activities such as merchant banking. The review should dovetail with the determination of what constitutes ``high-risk assets'' and ``high risk trading strategies'' under paragraph (d)(2). At this point, I yield to Senator Levin to discuss an issue that is of particular interest to him involving section 621's conflict of interest provisions. Mr. LEVIN. I thank my colleague for the detailed explanation he has provided of sections 619 and 620, and fully concur in it. I would like to add our joint explanation of section 621, which addresses the blatant conflicts of interest in the underwriting of asset-backed securities highlighted in a hearing with Goldman Sachs before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. The intent of section 621 is to prohibit underwriters, sponsors, and others who assemble asset-backed securities, from packaging and selling those securities and profiting from the securities' failures. This practice has been likened to selling someone a car with no brakes and then taking out a life insurance policy on the purchaser. In the asset- backed securities context, the sponsors and underwriters of the asset- backed securities are the parties who select and understand the underlying assets, and who are best positioned to design a security to succeed or fail. They, like the mechanic servicing a car, would know if the vehicle has been designed to fail. And so they must be prevented from securing handsome rewards for designing and selling malfunctioning vehicles that undermine the asset-backed securities markets. It is for that reason that we prohibit those entities from engaging in transactions that would involve or result in material conflicts of interest with the purchasers of their products. Section 621 is not intended to limit the ability of an underwriter to support the value of a security in the aftermarket by providing liquidity and a ready two-sided market for it. Nor does it restrict a firm from creating a synthetic asset-backed security, which inherently contains both long and short positions with respect to securities it previously created, so long as the firm does not take the short position. But a firm that underwrites an asset-backed security would run afoul of the provision if it also takes the short position in a synthetic asset-backed security that references the same assets it created. In such an instance, even a disclosure to the purchaser of the underlying asset-backed security that the underwriter has or might in the future bet against the security will not cure the material conflict of interest. We believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission has sufficient authority to define the contours of the rule in such a way as to remove the vast majority of conflicts of interest from these transactions, while also protecting the healthy functioning of our capital markets. In conclusion, we would like to acknowledge all our supporters, co- sponsors, and advisers who assisted us greatly in bringing this legislation to fruition. From the time President Obama announced his support for the Volcker Rule, a diverse and collaborative effort has emerged, uniting community bankers to old school financiers to reformers. Senator Merkley and I further extend special thanks to the original cosponsors of the PROP Trading Act, Senators Ted Kaufman, Sherrod Brown, and Jeanne Shaheen, who have been with us since the beginning. Senator Jack Reed and his staff did yeoman's work in advancing this cause. We further tip our hat to our tireless and vocal colleague, Senator Byron Dorgan, who opposed the repeal of Glass-Steagall and has been speaking about the risks from proprietary trading for a number of years. Above all, we pay tribute to the tremendous labors of Chairman Chris Dodd and his entire team and staff on the Senate Banking Committee, as well as the support of Chairman Barney Frank and Representative Paul Kanjorski. We extend our deep gratitude to our staffs, including the entire team and staff at the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, for their outstanding work. And last but not least, we highlight the visionary leadership of Paul Volcker and his staff. Without the support of all of them and many others, the Merkley-Levin language would not have been included in the Conference Report. We believe this provision will stand the test of time. We hope that our regulators have learned with Congress that tearing down regulatory walls without erecting new ones undermines our financial stability and threatens economic growth. We have legislated to the best of our ability. It is now up to our regulators to fully and faithfully implement these strong provisions. I yield the floor to Senator Merkley. Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague for his remarks and concur in all respects. Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I said so yesterday, and I will say it again: I thank Senator Merkley. I guess there are four new Members of the Senate serving on the Banking Committee. Senator Merkley, Senator Warner, Senator Tester, and Senator Bennet are all new Members of the Senate from their respective States of Oregon, Virginia, Montana, and Colorado. To be thrown into what has been the largest undertaking of the Banking Committee, certainly in my three decades here--and many have argued going back almost 100 years--was certainly an awful lot to ask. I have already pointed out the contribution Senator Warner has made to this bill. But I must say as well that Senator Bennet of Colorado has been invaluable in his contributions. I just mentioned Senator Tester a moment ago for his contribution on talking about rural America and the importance of those issues. And Senator Merkley, as a member of the committee, on matters we included here dealing particularly with the mortgage reforms, the underwriting standards, the protections people have to go through, and credit cards as well--we passed the credit card bill--again, it was Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon who played a critical role in that whole debate not to mention, of course, working with Carl Levin, one of the more senior Members here, having served for many years in the Senate. But the Merkley-Levin, Levin- Merkley provisions in this bill have added substantial contributions to this effort. So I thank him for his contribution. I see my colleague from North Dakota is here. I suggest the absence of a [[Page S5900]] quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided among both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we listened to Senator Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee, address the budget point of order. I urge my colleagues to waive the point of order. We came up with an alternative offset in the conference committee, much at the insistence--and I thanked him for that--of Senator Brown of Massachusetts, looking for a better offset than the ones which were originally in the conference report. I know my colleague from Maine as well had reservations about what we originally included. The offset here ends TARP, which I presume most people would welcome with open arms, saving us $11 billion by terminating it early, as well as then complying with the request by the chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Sheila Bair, to provide for additional assessments to meet the obligations of the FDIC and the insurance fund. Both of those items provide the necessary offsets to the cost of this bill. The long-term deficit point of order is caused by the orderly liquidation authority for systemically significant financial institutions. Let me note that this critically important aspect of the legislation was developed in very close cooperation with Senator Shelby in the Shelby-Dodd amendment. It also reflects the bipartisan cooperation of Senators Corker and Warner. The Shelby-Dodd amendment passed this body overwhelmingly with over 90 votes. Even though the liquidation authority is the source of long-term budget costs, it is still 100 percent paid for. The Shelby-Dodd amendment and the Boxer amendment made sure that this would be the case. Let me repeat, the liquidation authority, which is the dominant source of the budget cost in the bill, is 100 percent paid for over time. The only reason that the liquidation authority scores at all is because of timing. The FDIC may initially have to borrow funds from the Treasury in order to wind down the failed company and put it out of business. Because it will take time to liquidate a large, interconnected financial company, there is a lag between when the funds are borrowed and when they are repaid by the sale of the failed companies' assets, its creditors and assessments on the industry if necessary. One more important point on budget scoring and the liquidation authority. CBO cannot factor in the costs to our nation of a failure to address the possibility of future bailouts. We have lived through that nightmare and it has cost our country dearly. Now I would like to discuss the way in which we address the budget consequences of the legislation. In particular, I would like to respond to some comments that have been made about the provisions increasing the long-term minimum target for the FDIC and thereby strengthening the Deposit Insurance Fund, a goal that no one can credibly argue with in light of the recent crisis. In fact, this provision is supported by FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, and she has sent us a letter expressing her support. I will submit that for the Record at the end of this statement. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed that the use of the FDIC in this way is unprecedented and questioned how this could count as budget savings or offsets and at the same time preserve the funds for bank failures. Let us clear up the misinformation. First, no FDIC funds are being spent on, or transferred to, other programs. Premiums paid by banks remain, as they have for over 75 years, in the FDIC fund solely to protect insured deposits. And counting FDIC premiums as budget savings in legislation absolutely does have precedent. We have to look no further than relatively recent actions of Republican Congresses to find them. Budget reconciliation legislation enacted in February 2006 and sponsored by my colleague from New Hampshire, who was then the Chairman of the Budget Committee, included FDIC reforms authored by my colleague from Alabama, who was then Chairman of the Banking Committee. Those provisions resulted in higher FDIC premiums, which CBO said yielded almost $2 billion in budget savings over 10 years. So, my colleagues from New Hampshire and Alabama in fact relied on reforms to the Deposit Insurance Fund to obtain savings that CBO favorably scored. And 10 years earlier, Congress attached to an omnibus spending bill enacted in September 1996 a provision calling for a special premium on thrifts to capitalize the FDIC's thrift insurance fund. The appropriators in that earlier Republican Congress justified higher discretionary spending based partly on the budget savings scored by CBO for the FDIC assessment. I would also like to respond to some comments that have been made about the treatment of TARP in this legislation. We end TARP in the conference report. With the comprehensive financial reform put in place under this bill, we think it is the right time to bring TARP to a close, ending it earlier than had been planned. I think that is something everyone should be happy about. And ending TARP saves the government money. That is not just my conclusion. It is the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office, $11 billion in savings. It is true that the original TARP legislation passed as an emergency, its costs were declared an emergency when it passed, so rescinding those funds or ending the program now is ending spending that is considered ``emergency'' spending. But the savings are no less real because of that. Interestingly, my Republican colleague who has raised the point of order offered an amendment in conference that would have rescinded stimulus funding to pay for this bill. Why is that relevant? Because the stimulus money was also designated as an emergency, so it would have received the same accounting treatment here in the Senate as TARP. Both were emergencies. Both ending TARP early and rescinding stimulus funding would reduce the deficit, but the burden of cuts in stimulus funding would fall disproportionately on families and small businesses who have been victims of the economic fallout from the Wall Street crisis. Cutting such spending would be exactly the wrong thing to do as we try to get the economy back on track and people back to work. The fact is that overall this bill does not do damage to our budgetary outlook. It does make vital changes to make our financial system stronger and more stable and should be passed as soon as possible. So I urge my colleagues to support a motion to waive the long-term deficit point of order. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Washington, DC, June 29, 2010. Hon. Chris Dodd, Chairman, Committee on Banking, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Richard Shelby, Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Banking, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Barney Frank, Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Spencer Bachus, Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairmen Dodd and Frank and Ranking Members Shelby and Bachus: Thank you for your interest in our views regarding increasing the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) ratio to 1.35. Federal deposit insurance promotes public confidence in our nation's banking system by providing a safe place for consumers' funds. Deposit insurance has provided much needed stability throughout this crisis. Moreover, insured deposits provide banks with a stable and cost-effective source of funds for lending in their communities. Importantly, the DIF is funded by the insured banking industry. A key measure of the strength of the insurance fund is the reserve ratio, which is the amount in the DIF as a percentage of the industry's estimated insured deposits. Current [[Page S5901]] law requires us to maintain a reserve ratio of at least 1.15 percent. One of the lessons learned from the current crisis is that a minimum reserve ratio of 1.15 is insufficient to avoid the need for pro-cyclical assessments in times of stress. One of my first priorities when I assumed the Chairmanship of the FDIC in June of 2006 was to begin building our reserves. Regrettably, there was insufficient time before the crisis hit. Indeed, we started this crisis with a DIF reserve ratio of 1.22 percent (as of December 31, 2007). Beginning in mid-2008, as bank failures increased and the insurance fund incurred losses, the Fund balance and reserve ratio dropped precipitously. The reserve ratio became negative in the third quarter of 2009 and hit a low of negative 0.39 percent as of December 31, 2009. To date, we have collected more than $65 billion in assessments, and are projected to collect another $80 billion by 2016 to restore the fund. Given this experience, we believe it is clear that as the economy strengthens and the banking system heals, the reserve ratio needs to be increased. In fact, our Board has acted through regulation to target the reserve ratio at 1.25 percent, and a further increase to 1.35 percent is consistent with our view that the Fund should build up in good economic times and be allowed to fall in poor economic times, while maintaining relatively steady premiums throughout the economic cycle, thereby reducing the procyclicality of the assessment system. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further. Sincerely, Sheila C. Bair. I again urge my colleagues to vote to waive the budget point of order, and, of course, I urge them as well to support the legislation when that vote occurs. intent behind sections 691-621 Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to engage my colleagues, Senators Dodd and Levin, in a colloquy regarding some key aspects of our legislative intent behind sections 619 through 621, the Merkley-Levin rule on proprietary trading and conflicts of interest as included in the conference report. First, I would like to clarify several issues surrounding the ``de minimis'' investment provisions in subsection (d)(4). These provisions complement subsection (d)(1)(G), which permits firms to offer hedge funds and private equity funds to clients. ``De minimis'' investments under paragraph (4) are intended to facilitate these offerings principally by allowing a firm to start new funds and to maintain coinvestments in funds, which help the firm align its interests with those of its clients. During the initial start-up period, during which time firms may maintain 100 percent ownership, the fund should be relatively small, but sufficient to effectively implement the investment strategy. After the start up period, a firm may keep an ongoing ``alignment of interest'' coinvestment at 3 percent of a fund. Our intent is not to allow for large, revolving ``seed'' funds to evade the strong restrictions on proprietary trading of this section, and regulators will need to be vigilant against such evasion. The aggregate of all seed and coinvestments should be immaterial to the banking entity, and never exceed 3 percent of a firm's Tier 1 capital. Second, I would like to clarify the intent of subsection (f)'s provisions to prohibit banking entities from bailing out funds they manage, sponsor, or advise, as well as funds in which those funds invest. The ``permitted services'' provisions outlined in subsection (f) are intended to permit banks to maintain certain limited ``prime brokerage'' service relationships with unaffiliated funds in which a fund-of-funds that they manage invests, but are not intended to permit fund-of-fund structures to be used to weaken or undermine the prohibition on bailouts. Given the risk that a banking entity may want to bail out a failing fund directly or its investors, the ``permitted services'' exception must be implemented in a narrow, well-defined, and arms-length manner and regulators are not empowered to create loopholes allowing high-risk activities like leveraged securities lending or repurchase agreements. While we implement a number of legal restrictions designed to ensure that prime brokerage activities are not used to bail out a fund, we expect the regulators will nevertheless need to be vigilant. Before I yield the floor to Senator Levin to discuss several additional items, let me say a word of thanks to my good friend, Chairman Dodd, for taking the time to join me in clarifying these provisions. I also honor him for his extraordinary leadership on the entire financial reform package. As a fellow member of the Banking Committee, it has been a privilege to work with him on the entire bill, and not just these critical provisions. I also would like to recognize Senator Levin, whose determined efforts with his Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations helped highlight the causes of the recent crisis, as well as the need for reform. It has been a privilege working with him on this provision. Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator, and I concur with his detailed explanations. His tireless efforts in putting these commonsense restrictions into law will help protect American families from reckless risk-taking that endangers our financial system and our economy. The conflicts of interest provision under section 621 arises directly from the hearings and findings of our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which dramatically showed how some firms were creating financial products, selling those products to their customers, and betting against those same products. This practice has been likened to selling someone a car with no brakes and then taking out a life insurance policy on the purchaser. In the asset-backed securities context, the sponsors and underwriters of the asset-backed securities are the parties who select and understand the underlying assets, and who are best positioned to design a security to succeed or fail. They, like the mechanic servicing a car, would know if the vehicle has been designed to fail. And so they must be prevented from securing handsome rewards for designing and selling malfunctioning vehicles that undermine the asset-backed securities markets. It is for that reason that we prohibit those entities from engaging in transactions that would involve or result in material conflicts of interest with the purchasers of their products. First, I would like to address certain areas which we exclude from coverage. While a strong prohibition on material conflicts of interest is central to section 621, we recognize that underwriters are often asked to support issuances of asset-backed securities in the aftermarket by providing liquidity to the initial purchasers, which may mean buying and selling the securities for some time. That activity is consistent with the goal of supporting the offering, is not likely to pose a material conflict, and accordingly we are comfortable excluding it from the general prohibition. Similarly, market conditions change over time and may lead an underwriter to wish to sell the securities it holds. That is also not likely to pose a conflict. But regulators must act diligently to ensure that an underwriter is not making bets against the very financial products that it assembled and sold. Second, I would like to address the role of disclosures in relations to conflicts of interest. In our view, disclosures alone may not cure these types of conflicts in all cases. Indeed, while a meaningful disclosure may alleviate the appearance of a material conflict of interest in some circumstances, in others, such as if the disclosures cannot be made to the appropriate party or because the disclosure is not sufficiently meaningful, disclosures are likely insufficient. Our intent is to provide the regulators with the authority and strong directive to stop the egregious practices, and not to allow for regulators to enable them to continue behind the fig leaf of vague, technically worded, fine print disclosures. These provisions shall be interpreted strictly, and regulators are directed to use their authority to act decisively to protect our critical financial infrastructure from the risks and conflicts inherent in allowing banking entities and other large financial firms to engage in high risk proprietary trading and investing in hedge funds and private equity funds. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Dodd for his extraordinary dedication in shepherding this massive financial regulatory reform package through the Senate and the conference committee. This has been a long process, and he and his staff have been very able and supportive partners in this effort. Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator, and I strongly concur with the intentions and interpretations set forth by the principal authors of these provisions, Senators Merkley and Levin, as reflecting the legislative intent of the conference committee. I thank Senators Merkley and Levin for their [[Page S5902]] leadership, which was so essential in achieving the conference report provisions governing proprietary trading and prohibiting conflicts of interest. Assessing Individual Entities Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his continued work to ensure that appropriate resources are available to protect the economy from a future failure of a systemically risky financial institution and to help pay back taxpayers for the recent failures we experienced. With regard to assessments under the orderly liquidation authority of the bill, the bill requires that a risk-based matrix of factors be established by the FDIC, taking into account the recommendations of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to be used in connection with assessing any individual entity. One of the factors listed in the bill's risk matrix provision would take into account the activities of financial entities and their affiliates. Is it the intent of that language that a consideration of such factors should specifically include the impact of potential assessments on the ability of an institution that is a tax-exempt, not-for-profit organization to carry out their legally required charitable and educational activities? As the Senator knows, many Members of the Senate--like me--feel strongly that we must ensure that our constituents and communities continue to have access to these vital resources, and any potential assessment on tax-exempt groups which are charitable and/or educational by mission could severely hamper these groups' ability to fulfill their obligations to carry out their legally required activities. Mr. DODD. Yes, that is correct. The language is not intended to reduce such charitable and educational activities that are legally required for tax-exempt, not-for-profit organizations that are so important to communities across the country. I thank the Senator for his continued help on these efforts. section 603 trust companies Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to clarify the types of trust companies that fall within the scope of section 603(a), a provision that prohibits the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from approving an application for deposit insurance for certain companies, including certain trust companies, until 3 years after the date of enactment of this act. Mr. DODD. I would be glad to clarify the nature of trust companies subject to the moratorium under section 603(a). The moratorium applies to an institution that is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a commercial firm that functions solely in a trust or fiduciary capacity and is exempt from the definition of a bank in the Bank Holding Company Act. It does not apply to a nondepository trust company that does not have FDIC insurance and that does not offer demand deposit accounts or other deposits that may be withdrawn by check or similar means for payment to third parties. Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague for his clarification. Nonbank Financial Companies Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as we move to final passage of this historic legislation, I would like to thank Senator Dodd again for his leadership and strong support for my amendment to ensure that all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies regardless of size, as well as nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve, meet statutory minimum capital standards and thus have adequate capital throughout the economic cycle. Those standards required under section 171 serve as the starting point for the development of more stringent standards as required under section 165 of the bill. I did, however, have questions about the designation of certain nonbank financial companies under section 113 for Federal Reserve supervision and the significance of such a designation in light of the minimum capital standards established by section 171. While I can envision circumstances where a company engaged in the business of insurance could be designated under section 113, I would not ordinarily expect insurance companies engaged in traditional insurance company activities to be designated by the council based on those activities alone. Rather, in considering a designation, I would expect the council to specifically take into account, among other risk factors, how the nature of insurance differs from that of other financial products, including how traditional insurance products differ from various off- balance-sheet and derivative contract exposures and how that different nature is reflected in the structure of traditional insurance companies. I would also expect the council to consider whether the designation of an insurance company is appropriate given the existence of State-based guaranty funds to pay claims and protect policyholders. Am I correct in that understanding? Mr. DODD. The Senator is correct. The council must consider a number of factors, including, for example, the extent of leverage, the extent and nature of off-balance-sheet exposures, and the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, and mix of the company's activities. Where a company is engaged only in traditional insurance activities, the council should also take into account the matters you raised. Ms. COLLINS. Would the Senator agree that the council should not base designations simply on the size of the financial companies? Mr. DODD. Yes. The size of a financial company should not by itself be determinative. Ms. COLLINS. As the Senator knows, insurance companies are already heavily regulated by State regulators who impose their own, very different regulatory and capital requirements. The fact that those capital requirements are not the same as those imposed by section 171 should not increase the likelihood that the council will designate an insurer. Does the Senator agree? Mr. DODD. Yes, I do not believe that the council should decide to designate an insurer simply based on whether the insurer would meet bank capital requirements. Preemption Standard Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to see that the conference committee on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act retained my amendment regarding the preemption standard for State consumer financial laws with only minor modifications. I very much appreciate the effort of Chairman Dodd in fighting to retain the amendment in conference. Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. As the Senator knows, his amendment received strong bipartisan support on the Senate floor and passed by a vote of 80 to 18. It was therefore a Senate priority to retain his provision in our negotiations with the House of Representatives. Mr. CARPER. One change made by the conference committee was to restate the preemption standard in a slightly different way, but my reading of the language indicates that the conference report still maintains the Barnett standard for determining when a State law is preempted. Mr. DODD. The Senator is correct. That is why the conference report specifically cites the Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, 517 U.S. 25(1996) case. There should be no doubt that the legislation codifies the preemption standard stated by the U.S. Supreme Court in that case. Mr. CARPER. I again thank the Senator. This will provide certainty to everyone--those who offer consumers financial products and to consumer themselves. ____________________\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        News\nClark, Rove square off on the issues\n-\nPrint\n-\nComments\n-\nPODCAST\n-\n“As we help American financial institutions, we also must help American families in their homes.”\n-\n“Ninety-seven percent of the people paying mortgages on time are under no obligation to give [the other 3 percent] a home they couldn’t afford in the first place.”\nThe crisis on Wall Street, the war in Iraq, health care reform and claims of government-sponsored torture—no topic was off the table Friday night as two stalwarts of America’s major political parties squared off in a debate launching the 2008-09 Distinguished Speakers Series.\nRetired U.S. Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who served as the supreme allied commander for NATO from 1997 to 2000 and sought the Democratic party’s presidential nomination in 2004, and Karl Rove, Republican strategist and former senior advisor to President George W. Bush, engaged in a spirited debate before an audience of 3,500 in Alumni Arena on the same night presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain met for their first debate in Oxford, Miss.\nIn his opening remarks, Clark, who stepped in earlier this month in place of former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, noted that America is “a great nation with great values, great skills, great heritage and wonderful resources.”\n“And we’re a nation in trouble, and we need new ideas and we need new leadership in America,” he said.\nGuaranteeing access to health care and education for all Americans, restoring U.S. confidence overseas, ensuring American military forces are only used as a last resort and tackling worldwide challenges such as global warming, conflict and disease are some of the main challenges currently facing the United States, he added.\nRove, also laying out an agenda for America’s future, focused on reforming health care, education and Medicare by reducing government controls; restoring the economy by implementing a “simple, flat and low” tax system; controlling America’s dependence on foreign oil by focusing on technology; and encouraging stable democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan by “fighting and winning the global war on terror.”\n“Our goal must be to put in place the institutions and to gather the strength of the West to commit to the challenges that will shape the 21st century,” he said, “including transnational terrorism, WMDs (weapons of mass destruction) and rouge states like Iran and the threat of an insurgent Russia.”\nOn the subject of the current economic crisis, Rove repeatedly said that legislation designed to reign in mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the Bush Administration was blocked twice by Democrats, but Clark replied that the point was not enough to erase the record of a political party that’s long been opposed to government regulation.\n“As we help American financial institutions, we also must help American families in their homes,” Clark added in support of freezing government-acquired adjustable rate mortgages. But, Rove said, “97 percent of the people paying mortgages on time are under no obligation to give [the other 3 percent] a home they couldn’t afford in the first place.”\nOn health care, both men agreed that preventive care and electronic medical records should play a greater role in the future of the country’s health care system, but sharply diverged in their vision of how to deliver such services to the average American.\n“We need a plan to extend health care to those 47 million Americans who cannot afford insurance,” Clark said. “We need to move step by step, bringing Medicare down in age, bringing the children’s health insurance program up in age…and requiring insurance companies to accept people without disqualifying them for pre-existing conditions.”\nIn contrast, Rove outlined an independent system based on tax credits for health care costs, competition for health insurance across state lines and stricter restraints on medical malpractice suits. He also called for legislation enabling small businesses to pool their resources in order to provide stronger group benefits to their employees.\nThe most contentious moment came during a disagreement over whether the American military’s use of harsh interrogation tactics against enemy insurgents—tactics used against U.S. soldiers during the Korean conflict, according to Clark—constitute acts of torture. Rove referred to the reports of prisoner abuse at Guantanamo Bay that were cited by Clark as “gossip” and “slander” against the U.S. military.\n“There is a reason American has not been hit for seven years,” Rove said. “It’s because we’ve squeezed every bit of intelligence that we can from our enemies and we’ve used every intelligent technique at hand in order to find intelligence before they hit us again. I will make no apologies whatsoever for that at all.”\nReader Comments\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

With the passage of this bill, additional help is on the way.”\nSenator Paul Bettencourt’s proposal would raise the homestead exemption up to $140,000, which he estimates will save the average Texas homeowner about $363 in property taxes every year.\nThe homestead exemption stood at $15,000 in 2015. Since then, the legislature has approved bills to raise it first to $25,000, then $40,000, and finally up to $100,000 last session. The measures passed onto the full Senate Tuesday would raise the exemption up to $140,000. Bettencourt’s office projects the bill – added to additional compression of school property tax rates in the Senate version of the state budget– will save the average homeowner nearly $500 on their annual property tax bill, bringing the total amount of tax relief passed by the legislature since 2019 to $51 billion, he said. Bettencourt in the past has said that the homestead exemption is one of the most efficient ways to deliver tax relief to homeowners, a point reiterated by committee vice-chair and Galveston Senator Mayes Middleton. “It’s the most direct way,” he said. “It eliminates a portion of your school [maintenance and operations] tax bill.”\nHomeowners aged 65 years or older would qualify for an additional $10,000, for a total exemption of $150,000. Bettencourt says the actions of the legislature over the past few years have significantly reduced the tax burden of Texas senior citizens. “We have many over-65s in the state that are now paying zero tax as a result, and their bills that are not at zero are coming down each year,” he said. Prior to 2022, senior citizens had their property tax rates frozen, meaning they couldn’t rise, but also that they couldn’t go down in the event of a tax cut. “The best they could expect was that they weren’t going to pay more on that school tax bill every year,” said Bettencourt. That changed when the voters approved a measure in 2022 that would allow the reduction of frozen tax rates for senior and disabled homeowners when the legislature cuts property tax rates. “As either the tax rate goes down or the exemption goes up, that frozen value is un-frozen, and then the new lower result is then re-frozen, and the over-65 tax bills go down,” Bettencourt explained.\nAs with previous measures that cut school property tax rates, the bill includes a hold harmless provision that promises the state will make up any revenue lost by school districts. The measure would add to the ongoing costs of previous sessions’ tax relief efforts, which Bettencourt says is around $32 billion coming into the 89th Session. “When you commit to property tax relief, you have to commit, and you have to keep committing, you have to keep doing it every year,” he said. “Whether that money comes in for rate compression, or it comes in for homestead exemption, it has to go into the budget to work.”\nAbbott named property tax cuts as an emergency issue in his State of the State Address on February 2, clearing the way for passage of the measure within the first 60 days of the regular session. With 28 of 30 senators signed on as co-authors, the bill should sail through the full Senate when it comes up on the floor later this week or next. If the bill and joint resolution pass both chambers, voters must still approve the increased exemption. This proposal would appear as a question on the general election ballot in November. Previous ballot questions on the issue proved overwhelmingly popular, passing with greater than 80 percent support in 2015, 2022, and 2023.\n###\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        BILL WOULD CUT PROPERTY TAXES FOR SENIOR OR DISABLED HOMEOWNERS\n(AUSTIN) — Most homeowners with disabilities or aged 65 years or older would pay no school property taxes under a bill advanced by the Senate Local Government Committee Tuesday. Combined with previous property tax cut bills passed by the Senate, bill author and Houston Senator Paul Bettencourt says the average senior or disabled homeowner will save nearly a thousand dollars on their annual tax bill. “This bill is going to have probably the single greatest impact on senior property taxpayers and disabled property taxpayers as any bill we’ve ever passed yet in the Texas Senate,” he said. Under current law, about forty-five percent of senior and disabled homeowners pay no school property taxes in Texas. Should Bettencourt’s measure go into effect, he said that number could rise as high as 90 percent.\nSenior citizens who own their own homes have typically received extra benefits whenever the legislature passes a tax cut. Many senior homeowners have long had their property tax rates frozen to protect against tax hikes. When it turned out the freeze also applied to property tax cuts, the legislature passed a bill in 2023 that would allow them to go down with everyone else’s when a broad-based cut is passed. This session’s SB 4, which increased the homestead exemption for all homeowners from $100,000 up to $140,000, included an extra $10,000 for senior and disabled homeowners. The bill passed onto the full Senate Tuesday, SB 23, would raise their total homestead exemption all the way to $200,000.\nHousing affordability is a major concern for senior citizens, said Mike Taylor, representing the Texas Silver Haired Legislature, as they continue to see increases in cost of living. “What ever you giveth, the insurance premium will take away,” he said. “There’s someone always knocking at the door of older Texans trying to get more money out of them.” Reduction in expenses, like those proposed in SB 23, are functionally income increases for senior citizens. “This is a big help,” said Taylor.\nGalveston Senator Mayes Middleton’s bill would require operators to plug inactive wells after 15 years.\nThe bill is also a priority of Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, who said he was working with the House and Governor Greg Abbott to achieve the higher exemption. “I believe, that working with the Speaker and the governor, we can get that homestead exemption to $200,000 this year,” Patrick told reporters at a press conference in early April. “That will wipe out almost every senior from having to pay any [maintenance and operation] school tax, which is the biggest part of their bill.”\nOn the floor Tuesday, the Senate approved a plan to deal with the 160,000 inactive wells dotting the state before they become abandoned “orphan” wells. Sometimes these wells can be revitalized, using new techniques or technologies to extract more oil. When abandoned by operators, they are left to the effects of time and nature, and to the Railroad Commission to clean up. In their 2024 report, the Commission estimated nearly 9,000 such wells exist in Texas. “We need to address those that have reached the end of their lifespan and could potentially pose a risk to health, safety, natural resources, agriculture, livestock and wildlife,” said Galveston Senator Mayes Middleton.\nThe state also lays out a lot of taxpayer dollars to deal with the issue, he said, paying to plug over 1,000 orphan wells last fiscal year at a cost of $34 million. The current budget includes $100 million to plug more wells over the next two years. Middleton’s bill, SB 1150, would require that an oil and gas operators to either reactivate or plug an orphan well after fifteen years of inactivity. The new requirements would be phased in slowly beginning in 2027, giving state regulators and operators time to plan for implementation.\n###\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Homestead exemptions can help lower the property taxes on your home. Here, learn how to claim a homestead exemption. You might be able to claim a homestead exemption based on whether you are 65 or older, have a disability, or are a veteran of the military.\nWhat property qualifies as a \"homestead?\"\nA “homestead” is a house or other residential structure that you own, together with up to 20 acres where the structure sits if the land is used for residential purposes. A manufactured home on a rented lot qualifies as long as you own the home. Manufactured homes must meet additional requirements for a \"Statement of Ownership and Location,\" but if you did not receive the paperwork from the prior owner and cannot locate the seller after making a good faith effort, you can submit the affidavit in Form 114-A.\nWho is eligible for a homestead exemption?\nGeneral residence homestead exemption. You are eligible for a homestead exemption if you (1) own your home (partial ownership counts), (2) the home is your principal residence, and (3) you have a Texas driver’s license or Texas-issued personal identification certificate (your I.D. card address must match your principal residence address).\nHomeowners who qualify for a general residence homestead exemption are also eligible for the following exemptions if they meet these criteria:\n- Over 65 exemption: For homeowners 65 and older. If you are over 65 when you die, your surviving spouse, if they are 55 or older, will get your over-65 exemption.\n- Disability exemption: For homeowners (not their children) who have a disability that would qualify for Social Security Disability benefits. If you are a senior with a disability, you can take only one of the exemptions.\n- Veteran exemption: For veterans with a disability, their spouses and survivors, and spouses and survivors of military personnel killed on active duty. The amount of the exemption depends on the percentage of service-connected disability.\nHow much will I save with the homestead exemption?\nGeneral Residence Homestead Exemption. The general residence homestead exemption is a $100,000 school tax exemption. This means that your school taxes are calculated as if your home is worth $100,000 less than its appraised value. For example, if your home is appraised at $300,000, you will only be taxed on $200,000.\nLocal Residence Homestead Exemptions. Some local governments have adopted additional homestead exemptions for school taxes. These local exemptions are based on a percentage of the homestead value. For example, a 20% local exemption applied to a $200,000 homestead would reduce the taxable amount to $160,000. When you then apply the $100,000 general exemption, the taxable amount falls to $60,000.\nElderly and Disabled Exemptions. If you are elderly or disabled, you qualify for an additional $10,000 school tax exemption. Some areas have even higher local exemptions for the elderly and disabled.\nElderly and disabled persons also get at least a $3,000 homestead exemption when calculating county taxes collected for flood control and farm-to-market road maintenance. This exemption may be larger in some districts.\nIf you qualify for both elderly and disabled exemptions, you may only choose one per tax district.\nVeteran Homestead Exemptions. The veteran homestead exemption is based on the veteran’s disability rating.\n| Disability Rating | Homestead Exemption |\n|---|---|\n| 100% | Full exemption (no property taxes) |\n| 70 to 99% | $12,000 |\n| 50 to 69% | $10,000 |\n| 30 to 49% | $7,500 |\n| 10 to 29% | $5,000 |\nA veteran also qualifies for the $12,000 exemption if any of the following apply:\n- They are at least 65 years old and have a disability rating of at least 10%.\n- They are blind in one or both eyes.\n- They have lost the use of one or more limbs.\nWhen a disabled veteran dies, the surviving spouse continues to get an exemption at the same level until they remarry. If the veteran's spouse dies before the veteran, any surviving children under 18 split the exemption amount amongst themselves.\nIf a servicemember dies while on active duty, their surviving spouse gets a $5,000 exemption.\nHow do I apply for a homestead exemption?\nYou must apply with your county appraisal district to get a homestead exemption. Applying is free and only needs to be filed once. You can find forms on your appraisal district website or you can use the Texas Comptroller forms.\nGeneral Exemption Form 50-114. You can use Texas Comptroller Form 50-114 to apply for the General Homestead Exemption.\nIf you turn 65 or become newly disabled, you need to submit new application to obtain the extra exemption. These exemptions use the same Form 50-114 along with Supplemental Affidavit Form 50-144-A.\nSupplemental Affidavit Form 50-144-A. You will also need Texas Comptroller Form 50-144-A if you are applying for an exemption based on any of the following:\n- Age 65 or older\n- Disability (non-veteran)\n- Ownership of a manufactured home without written ownership documentation\n- Heirship property\nDisabled Veteran’s or Survivor’s Exemption Form 50-135. You can use Texas Comptroller Form 50-135 to apply for the Disabled Veteran’s or Survivor’s Exemption.\nIs there a limit on how much my appraisal value can rise?\nYour homestead's tax appraisal value cannot increase more than 10% each year, plus the value of any improvements you made in the past year.\nHow often do I need to apply for a homestead exemption?\nYou only need to apply for a homestead exemption once. You do not need to reapply every year.\nThe appraiser will review your homestead exemption at least once every five years to make sure the property still qualifies. However, you do not need to reapply to keep your exemption.\nIf the appraisal office decides that your current exemption is no longer valid, you may apply for another type of exemption if you qualify.\nLikewise, if you lose your homestead exemption after moving and later return to the property as your primary residence, you may apply for a new homestead exemption.\nHow do I qualify for a homestead exemption on an inherited home?\nIf you have inherited your home, you can qualify for 100% of the homestead exemption if the home is your primary residence. If you do not have a deed in your name or other recorded instrument documenting your ownership, you can still qualify for an exemption by completing a simple affidavit in the homestead exemption application form, which is available in Form 50-114-A on the Texas Comptroller’s website. Several other documents must be submitted with the application as proof of ownership. See the instructions for Form 50-114 and information about “Heir Property.” Also, see Inherited Homes, Homestead Exemptions, and Property Taxes.\nWhen do I apply for a homestead exemption?\nYou can apply for a homestead exemption at any time. If your application is postmarked by April 30, the exemption can be processed in time for your property tax bill that comes out in the fall. If you file after April 30, the exemption will be applied retroactively if you file up to one year after the tax delinquency date (typically February 1 of the following tax year). You can also apply anytime for the over-65 or disabled person exemption after you qualify; the exemption will be applied retroactively if you file within a year of turning 65 or becoming disabled.\nWhat happens if I don't pay my property taxes?\nIf you do not pay your property taxes, the county can put a lien on your homestead and foreclose on your home unless you have qualified for a deferral. After foreclosure, you have two years to buy back your home. Your homestead is not subject to foreclosure for unpaid property taxes from 20 or more years ago. Homeowners with an over-65, disability, or disabled veterans exemption are eligible for a deferral from property taxes until they die or until the home is no longer their primary residence. At this time, all the taxes are due unless the person’s heirs also qualify for a deferral. Interest on deferred taxes accumulates at an annual rate of eight percent and is due at the same time as the taxes. You can apply for a deferral from your county appraisal district if you are eligible. First, check with your mortgage company to ensure your deferral won’t violate your loan terms.\nCan I ask for a payment plan to pay my property taxes?\nYou may be able to ask for a payment plan to pay your property taxes. When a person with a homestead exemption is delinquent in the payment of taxes, the tax collector is required to enter into a repayment installment plan of 12 to 36 months if the homeowner requests a plan, as long as the homeowner has not entered into a plan in the prior 24 months. Interest accrues at 12 percent a year. Persons with an over-65, disability, or disabled veterans' exemption can spread their tax payments over a year in four installments without penalty or interest. To use the installment payment plan option, you must include a notice about this with your first payment. The payments are due before February 1, April 1, June 1, and August 1.\nDeferrals vs. Exemptions\nDeferrals and exemptions are not the same.\nAn exemption lessens the taxes you owe. You must still pay any remaining taxes on time.\nA deferral allows you to put off paying taxes you owe. It does not lessen the taxes you owe, and interest may accrue. Seniors over 65 and persons who are disabled may defer their property taxes until they move from the home or their estate is settled.\nIf the owners are married, can they claim two homestead exemptions?\nNo. A married couple can claim only one homestead.\nWhat happens to the homestead exemption if I move away from the home?\nIf you move away from the home, the homestead exemption still applies if:\n- You do not establish another primary residence;\n- You intend to return and\n- You are away for less than two years unless you are in military service or live in a nursing home, assisted living, or similar facility.\nWhat happens to the homestead exemption if I rent my home?\nIf you rent out part of your home or use part of it for a business, the exemption still applies to the entire home, including the rented portion, as long as the home is still your principal residence (and if you move away, you meet the requirements above).\nIf my home is damaged or destroyed in a disaster, is my homestead exemption affected?\nIf your homestead is damaged or destroyed by disaster and you cannot live in it, the homestead exemption will still apply for up to two years from the date that the physical preparation for rebuilding begins. You must rebuild on the same property and live there afterward.\nRelated Articles\n-\nProperty Tax Protest and Appeals\nThis article explains how to protest property taxes in Texas. -\nInherited Homes and Homestead Exemptions\nThis article explains how to get a homestead exemption on a property you inherited in Texas. -\nDisaster and Property Taxes\nThis article examines whether your property taxes can be reduced after a disaster.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

This momentous display of civic activism took place on the National Mall, \"America's Front Yard\" and was the culmination of an idea born more than 20 years before.\nWhile the March was a collaborative effort, sponsored by leaders of various student, civil rights, and labor organizations, the original idea came from A. Philip Randolph, a labor organizer and founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and the Negro American Labor Council (NALC). His vision for a march on the Nation's Capital dated to the 1940s when he twice proposed large-scale marches to protest segregation and discrimination in the U.S. military and the U.S. defense industry and to pressure the White House to take action. The pressure worked. President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802 (Prohibition of Discrimination in the Defense Industry, 1941) and President Truman signed Executive Order 9981 (Desegregation of the Armed Forces, 1948), and Randolph cancelled the marches.\nOrganizing the March\nBy the 1960s, a public expression of dissatisfaction with the status quo was considered necessary and a march was planned for 1963, with Randolph as the titular head. Joining Randolph in sponsoring the March were the leaders of the five major civil rights groups: Roy Wilkins of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Whitney Young of the National Urban League (NUL), Martin Luther King, Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), James Farmer of Congress On Racial Equality, and John Lewis of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). These \"Big Six,\" as they were called, expanded to include Walter Reuther of the United Auto Workers (UAW),Joachim Prinz of the American Jewish Congress (AJC), Eugene Carson Blake of the Commission on Religion and Race of the National Council of Churches, and Matthew Ahmann of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice. In addition, Dorothy Height of the National Council of Negro Women participated in the planning, but she operated in the background of this male dominated, leadership group.\nThe March was organized in less than 3 months. Randolph handed the day-to-day planning to his partner in the March on Washington Movement, Bayard Rustin, a pioneer of the 1947 Journey of Reconciliation and a brilliant strategist of nonviolent direct action protests. Rustin planned everything, from training \"marshals\" for crowd control using nonviolent techniques to the sound system and setup of porta-potties. There was also an Organizing Manual that laid out a statement of purpose, specific talking points, and logistics. Rustin saw that to maintain order over such a large crowd, there needed to be a highly organized support structure.\nRustin coordinated a staff of over 200 civil rights activists and organizers to assist in publicizing the march and recruiting marchers, organizing churches to raise money, coordinating buses and trains, and administering all of the other logistical details. In many ways, the March defied expectations. The number of people that attended exceeded the initial estimates made by the organizers. Rustin had indicated that they expected over 100,000 people to attend - the final estimate was 250,000, 190,000 blacks and 60,000 whites.\nA Powerful, Peaceful Protest\nWith that many people converging on the city, there were concerns about violence. The Washington, D.C. police force mobilized 5,900 officers for the march and the government mustered 6,000 soldiers and National Guardsmen as additional protection. President Kennedy thought that if there were any problems, the negative perceptions could undo the civil rights bill making its way through Congress. In the end, the crowds were calm and there were no incidents reported by police.\nWhile the March was a peaceful occasion, the words spoken that day at the Lincoln Memorial were not just uplifting and inspirational such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\"speech, they were also penetrating and pointed. There was a list of \"Ten Demands\" from the sponsors, insisting on a fair living wage, fair employment policies, and desegregation of school districts. John Lewis in his speech said that \"we do not want our freedom gradually but we want to be free now\" and that Congress needed to pass \"meaningful legislation\" or people would march through the South. Although the SNCC chairman had toned down his remarks at the request of white liberals and moderate black allies, he still managed to criticize both political parties for moving too slowly on civil rights. Others such as Whitney Young and Joachim Prinz spoke of the need for justice, for equal opportunity, for full access to the American Dream promised with the Declaration of Independence and reaffirmed with the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. They spoke of jobs, and of a life free from the indifference of lawmakers to people's plights.\nIn the end, after all of the musical performances, speeches, and politics, it was the people that truly made the March on Washington a success. They brought box lunches, having spent all they could spare to get to Washington; some dressed as if attending a church service while others wore overalls and boots; veterans of the Civil Rights Movement and individuals new to the issues locked arms, clapped and sang and walked. Many began without their leaders, who were making their way to them from meetings on Capitol Hill. They could no longer be patient and they could no longer be held back, and so they started to march - Black, White, Latino, American Indian, Jewish, Christian, men, women, famous, anonymous, but ultimately all Americans, all marching for their civil rights.\nTags\n- lincoln memorial\n- martin luther king, jr. national historical park\n- martin luther king, jr. memorial\n- national mall and memorial parks\n- civil rights\n- civil rights movement\n- march on washington\n- martin luther king jr.\n- national mall\n- labor\n- labor movement\n- african american history\n- labor history\n- washington d.c.\n- washington dc\n- dc history\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The 1963 March on Washington\nA Quarter Million People and a Dream\nOn August 28, 1963, more than a quarter million people participated in the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, gathering near the Lincoln Memorial.\nMore than 3,000 members of the press covered this historic march, where Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered the exalted \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\nOriginally conceived by renowned labor leader A. Phillip Randolph and Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the NAACP, the March on Washington evolved into a collaborative effort amongst major civil rights groups and icons of the day.\nStemming from a rapidly growing tide of grassroots support and outrage over the nation's racial inequities, the rally drew over 260,000 people from across the nation.\nCelebrated as one of the greatest — if not the greatest — speech of the 20th century, Dr. King's celebrated speech, \"I Have a Dream,\" was carried live by television stations across the country. You can read the full speech and watch a short film, below.\nA March 20 Years in the Making\nIn 1941, A. Phillip Randolph first conceptualized a \"march for jobs\" in protest of the racial discrimination against African Americans from jobs created by WWII and the New Deal programs created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nThe march was stalled, however, after negotiations between Roosevelt and Randolph prompted the establishment of the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC) and an executive order banning discrimination in defense industries.\nThe FEPC dissolved just five years later, causing Randolph to revive his plans. He looked to the charismatic Dr. King to breathe new life into the march.\nNAACP and SCLC Center the March on Civil Rights\nBy the late 1950s, Dr. King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) were also planning to march on Washington, this time to march for freedom.\nAs the years passed on, the Civil Rights Act was still stalled in Congress, and equality for Americans of color still seemed like a far-fetched dream.\nRandolph, his chief aide, Bayard Rustin, and Dr. King all decided it would be best to combine the two causes into one mega-march, the March for Jobs and Freedom.\nNAACP, headed by Roy Wilkins, was called upon to be one of the leaders of the march.\nAs one of the largest and most influential civil rights groups at the time, our organization harnessed the collective power of its members, organizing a march that was focused on the advancement of civil rights and the actualization of Dr. King's dream.\nThe Big Six\nA quarter-million people strong, the march drew activists from far and wide.\nLeaders of the six prominent civil rights groups at the time joined forces in organizing the march.\nThe group included Randolph, leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the NAACP; Dr. King, Chairman of the SCLC; James Farmer, founder of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE); John Lewis, President of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC); and Whitney Young, Executive Director of the National Urban League.\nDr. King, originally slated to speak for 4 minutes, went on to speak for 16 minutes, giving one of the most iconic speeches in history.\n\"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.\"\n– I Have a Dream, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\nIt didn't take long for King's dream to come to fruition — the legislative aspect of the dream, that is.\nAfter a decade of continued lobbying of Congress and the President led by the NAACP, plus other peaceful protests for civil rights, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nOne year later, he signed the National Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nTogether, these laws outlawed discrimination against blacks and women, effectively ending segregation, and sought to end disenfranchisement by making discriminatory voting practices illegal.\nTen years after King joined the civil rights fight, the campaign to secure the enactment of the 1964 Civil Rights Act had achieved its goal – to ensure that black citizens would have the power to represent themselves in government.\n2020 March on Washington\nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered this iconic 'I Have a Dream' speech at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. See entire text of King's speech below.\nI Have a Dream\nI am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\nBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free; one hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination; one hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity; one hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.\nSo we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was the promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note in so far as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\"\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\nWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.\nThis is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.\nNow is the time to make real the promises of democracy; now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice; now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood; now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment.\nThis sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content, will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\nBut there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the worn threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.\nWe must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protests to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy, which has engulfed the Negro community, must not lead us to a distrust of all white people. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.\nWe cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\nThere are those who are asking the devotees of Civil Rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\"\nWe can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality; we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities; we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one; we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \"For Whites Only\"; we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote, and the Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.\nNo! no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\"\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality.\nYou have been the veterans of creative suffering.\nContinue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\nGo back to Mississippi. Go back to Alabama. Go back to South Carolina. Go back to Georgia. Go back to Louisiana. Go back to the slums and ghettos of our Northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.\nI say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.\nIt is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\"\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\nI have a dream today!\nI have a dream that one day down in Alabama — with its vicious racists, with its Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification — one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\nI have a dream today!\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will be made straight, \"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\"\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.\nWith this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brother-hood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\nAnd this will be the day.\nThis will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, \"My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my father died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.\" And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.\nSo let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire; let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.\nBut not only that.\nLet freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and mole hill of Mississippi. \"From every mountainside, let freedom ring.\"\nAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:\n\"Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.\"\nSource: Martin Luther King, Jr., I Have A Dream: Writings and Speeches that Changed the World (San Francisco: Harper, 1986) via Teaching America History.\nMeet other heroes who advanced racial justice\nThe voices of these visionaries shape our present and inform our future.\nView all civil rights leadersJoin the fight\nYou are critical to the hard, complex work of ending racial inequality.\nBecome an NAACP member\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

He’s wrong Politics Jul 6, 2016 4:26 PM EST WASHINGTON — Donald Trump gives credit where credit isn’t due when he brands Saddam Hussein a potent foil of terrorists. Iraq’s dictator was responsible for gassing thousands of Kurdish civilians, using chemical weapons against Iran, invading Kuwait, crushing political dissent and giving money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers who terrorized Israelis. But killing terrorists? Not in the eyes of the West. The U.S. listed Iraq during the Saddam years not as an opponent of terrorism, but as a state sponsor of it. And now, the late dictator’s Baath party makes up the organizational backbone of the Islamic State, the principal Islamic extremist threat. Trump has maintained for a decade that the otherwise bad Iraqi leader was good in taking on terrorists. “You know what he did well?” he asked a campaign crowd in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Tuesday night. “He killed terrorists. He did that so good.” He went on: “They didn’t read ’em the rights, they didn’t talk. They were a terrorist, it was over.” In October, Trump asserted the world would be “100 percent” better off if Saddam and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi had been allowed to stay in power. This, despite the fact Trump initially if unenthusiastically supported the invasion of Iraq (“I guess so”) and called strongly for the West to step in and help oust Gadhafi, which it did. On this subject, Trump has seemed to lament the constitutional protections of the U.S. justice system even while overstating their use when it comes to terrorists. No one read Osama bin Laden his rights when U.S. forces burst into his compound and killed him. Trump’s broader point — that dictators can bring stability — has indeed guided U.S. foreign policy at times, when repressive regimes have had a pro-U.S. slant or were otherwise useful in Cold War-era rivalry with the Soviet Union. Saddam was at one time a U.S. ally for that reason. The U.S. listed Iraq during the Saddam years not as an opponent of terrorism, but as a state sponsor of it. In the late 1980s, Saddam’s forces unleashed poisonous gas on Kurdish villages, aiming to counter a rebellion and killing mostly civilians. The ghastly results underscored Saddam’s willingness to use any means to put down perceived opponents of any stripe, not just those he might have considered terrorists. In Shiite and Kurdish uprisings in the 1990s, groups carried out attacks that could fall under a broad definition of terrorism, and Saddam had many of the opponents killed. Some were linked to groups supported by the U.S., others to groups that Washington considered terrorist organizations. Before the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, Saddam had little to do with al-Qaida, then the main terrorist danger to Americans. As part of its justification for the invasion, the Bush administration asserted that Saddam was in league with al-Qaida, sponsor of the 9/11 attacks. That was wrong. But Saddam was not killing al-Qaida fighters, either, as might be construed from Trump’s remarks. The organization was scarcely a presence in Iraq at the time. For many years Saddam sheltered and supported one terrorist in particular, the notorious Palestinian assassin Abu Nidal, whose Iraqi-armed group carried out deadly attacks against Israelis, rival Palestinians and Syrians opposed by Saddam. Abu Nidal died in Iraq in murky circumstances in 2002. He had apparently crossed Saddam. It’s possible this terrorist died in a manner cited by Trump. If so, it was not because Saddam wanted to make the world safer against terrorism.

The longtime Iraqi president was hanged after a tribunal found him guilty of crimes against humanity in 2006.\nOn Tuesday, Hussein was one of the top trending topics on Twitter after U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump offered more praise for his style of leadership.\n\"Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, right? He was a bad guy, really bad guy. But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights, they didn't talk. They were a terrorist, it was over,\" Trump told his supporters.\nHe has made similar statements in the past few years, including in 2014 when he wrote on Twitter that Iraq was more dangerous than it ever was under Hussein.\n\"War was a mistake, as I said from the very beginning. Bush and Obama should apologize.\"\nBut days after U.S. forces found Hussein hiding in a hole near the city of Tikrit in December 2003, Trump appeared more supportive of the Iraqi leader being pushed from power.\n\"Some people agree and some people don't agree, but we are there. And if we are there, you have to take down Saddam Hussein,\" Trump said in an interview on Fox News. \"And they have done that, and they did it maybe not as quickly as they thought in terms of finding him, but they found him. And that is a huge day for this country.\"\nBush's justifications\nFormer President George W. Bush, who launched the Iraq invasion, cited among other justifications Iraq's repeated violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions, including one barring it from allowing any terror group to operate on its soil.\n\"Iraq continues to shelter and support terrorist organizations that direct violence against Iran, Israel and Western governments,\" he said in an address to the U.N. General Assembly in late 2002. \"Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for murder. In 1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the Emir of Kuwait and a former American President.\"\nThat former president was Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, who was in office when U.S. forces led the defeat of Iraq after Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait. President Bill Clinton ordered airstrikes against Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad after getting what he called compelling evidence that Iraq was responsible for the assassination plot.\nSponsor of international terrorism\nJudith Yaphe, a former senior Middle East analyst at the CIA told the U.S. commission that investigated the September 11, 2001 terror attacks that Iraq under Hussein's leadership was a \"primary sponsor of international terrorism.\"\n\"Baghdad actively sponsored terrorist groups, providing safe haven, training, arms, and logistical support, requiring in exchange that the groups carry out operations ordered by Baghdad for Saddam's objectives.\"\nShe said that support included the Abu Nidal Organization and the Palestine Liberation Front, as well as Hussein offering $25,000 to the family of any Palestinian who died carrying out an attack on Israelis.\n\"Saddam's regime first and foremost was a skilled user of terrorism to intimidate Iraqis and eliminate opponents, real and imaginary,\" Yaphe said. \"Saddam's multiple security services succeeded in its internal goals and in eliminating its critics, defectors, and enemies abroad.\"\nLoss for words\nAfter hearing Trump's comments Tuesday, former Iraqi Ambassador to the U.S. Lukman Faily said he was at a loss for words.\n\"As a diplomat, I tried to keep away from this, but as an Iraqi and a victim of Saddam's ethnic cleansing of us Failys I say get your facts first,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nCriticism also came from the campaign of Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent in the November election.\n\"Donald Trump's praise for brutal strongmen seemingly knows no bounds. He has applauded the strength China showed in the Tiananmen Square massacre, offered admiration for Kim Jong Un's murderous consolidation of power in North Korea, and consistently lavished praised on Vladimir Putin,\" said Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan. \"Trump's cavalier compliments for brutal dictators, and the twisted lessons he seems to have learned from their history, again demonstrate how dangerous he would be as Commander-in-Chief and how unworthy he is of the office he seeks.\"\nTrump unfazed\nTrump is unlikely to be fazed by the criticism. Throughout the campaign he has portrayed himself as the candidate best able to respond to the current threat posed by the Islamic State group in Iraq.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        RALEIGH, North Carolina -- Donald Trump, who frequently criticizes U.S. foreign policy under President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is praising Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ruthlessness.\n\"Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, right? ... But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good,\" Trump told supporters at a campaign rally Tuesday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. \"They didn't read 'em the rights, they didn't talk. They were a terrorist, it was over.\"\nTrump has previously said the world would be \"100 percent better\" if dictators like Hussein and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi were still in power. Prior to the U.S. invasion, Iraq was listed by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism. Hussein suppressed dissent in his country and used poison gas against 5,000 Iraqi Kurds.\nJake Sullivan, a Clinton senior policy adviser, said Trump's \"praise for brutal strongmen seemingly knows no bounds.\"\nSullivan said such comments \"demonstrate how dangerous he would be as commander-in-chief and how unworthy he is of the office he seeks.\"\nTrump's foreign policy pronouncements have proved controversial, even within the Republican Party that is poised to nominate him for president in a few weeks. He has said the United States is too fully engaged around the world and has questioned the role of NATO and said the United States has been taken advantage of by nations benefiting from its security cooperation and troop presence. Some critics within the GOP have said his policies suggest an isolationist stance in an increasingly dangerous world.\nSens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, partners among Republican congressional critics of Obama administration foreign policy, carried out a fact-check on Trump's national security statements earlier this year at a Capitol Hill hearing.\nOn April 19, when the Army general selected to lead U.S. forces in South Korea testified before the committee, McCain seized the opportunity to undermine Trump's suggestion that the U.S. withdraw its forces from the South because Seoul isn't paying enough to cover the cost of the American military presence.\n\"Isn't it the fact that it costs us less to have troops stationed in Korea than in the United States, given the contribution the Republic of Korea makes?\" McCain asked Gen. Vincent Brooks.\nYes, Brooks said, telling McCain the South Koreans pay half, or $808 million annually, of the U.S. presence there.\nTwo days later, Trump's claim that NATO is irrelevant and ill-suited to fight terrorism came under the microscope. As president, Trump has said he would force member nations to increase their contributions, even if that risked breaking up the 28-country alliance.\nIn early March, more than 70 conservative national experts, including former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, wrote in an open letter that they have disagreed with one another on a variety of issues but are united in their opposition to a Trump presidency. Chertoff served in President George W. Bush's administration.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Today we’re tackling the oft-repeated claim that the typical minimum wage earner is no longer a young person with little or no work experience, but instead is an older, established worker “trying to survive on totally inadequate wages.”\nIn their editorial, Senators Murray and Sanders say, “Despite a popular misconception, minimum-wage workers are not all high school kids. In fact, the average worker who would benefit from a $15-an-hour minimum wage is age 36.”\nIt’s important to note they don’t say the average minimum wage earner is 36. They say the average worker who would benefit from their proposed $15 wage is 36. Of course, the higher the proposed minimum wage, the greater the effect of raising both the average and median age of a minimum wage worker.\nWhich brings us to the importance of differentiating between the median age versus the average age of a minimum wage worker. For example, when a sluggish economy (or an enticingly high minimum wage) send older workers who otherwise would be enjoying their retirement back into the job market, the average age increases significantly. The median age shows the middle point, where half of minimum wage earners are younger and half are older.\nSo let’s examine who currently earns the minimum wage. The claim is routinely made that the average age of a minimum wage earner is 35 or 36. Wage hike supporters conjure images of middle-age workers who are working full-time as they desperately try to support their family while trapped in low-wage jobs.\nThe reality is much different. As pointed out by the Pulitzer Prize winning PolitiFact National, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics paints “a starkly different picture of low-wage workers.\"\nAccording to the BLS, “minimum wage workers tend to be young.” Of the tiny group of workers (just 2.6% of all workers in the U.S.) who earn minimum wage, 45% are under the age of 25, and 60% are under the age of 30. That puts the median age for people earning the minimum much closer to mid-twenties than middle age. To complete the picture, 65% have never been married, nearly 60% work part-time and 62% live with their parents (or another relative) or are single.\nSo while Senators Murray and Sanders are correct in asserting that not all minimum wage earners are high school kids, the data clearly shows the majority of them are young and many are still in school. Most are not poor, are not working full-time and are not relying on their wages as the sole source of income to support a family.\nIn other words, very few are “trying to survive” on their minimum wage earnings.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        March 11, 2024\nIn discussions about minimum wages, policymakers often express differing views about mobility out of low-wage work. Some view low-wage jobs largely as entry-level stepping stones to higher-wage jobs. Others see low wages as a persistent feature of many workers’ careers. In this post, we present estimates to help inform this debate.\nUnfortunately, we do not have state-level data that track individual workers over long periods. Instead, we use data from Monthly Current Population Surveys (CPS) to look at this issue indirectly in two ways:\nOne-Year Snapshot of Low-Wage Workers’ Ages. In the first approach, we simply look at a snapshot of the age distribution of low-wage workers in 2023. If most low-wage jobs were stepping stones to higher-wage jobs, then we would expect most low-wage workers to be young.\nCohort-Level Mobility Over Time. In the second approach, we use CPS data from 2002 through 2023 to track the how the rate of low-wage work changes over time for cohorts of workers born in the same year.\nLimitations of Survey-Based Estimates. Like many economic measurements, our estimates come from survey data. As described in the Appendix, various aspects of the data make our estimates imprecise, though we have tried to make them as accurate as possible.\nDefinition of Low-Wage Workers. In this section, we use the term “low-wage workers” to refer to employees who made up to $17.50 per hour at their main job in 2023. These workers likely would be affected directly by proposals to increase the statewide minimum wage.\nLow-Wage Workers More Likely to Be Under 25 Than Mid-to-High-Wage Workers. As shown in Figure 1, just under 30 percent of low-wage workers are younger than 25. In contrast, less than 10 percent of mid-to-high-wage workers fall into this age group.\nHalf of Low-Wage Workers Are 35 or Older. Although many low-wage workers are young, many others are old enough to be well into their careers. Roughly half are at least 35 years old.\nOne-Quarter of Low-Wage Workers Are 50 or Older. The age distribution of low-wage workers extends well into middle age. More than one-quarter of low-wage workers are at least 50 years old.\nAges of Male and Female Low-Wage Workers Are Similar. Figure 1 shows that male and female low-wage workers have similar age distributions. Similarly, we do not observe large gender differences in the age distribution of mid-to-high-wage workers.\nEstimates Very Similar Without Recent Immigrants. Figure 1 seems to suggest that many people stay in low-wage work for a long time, but it does not rule out some alternative explanations. One might speculate, for instance, that older low-wage workers tend to be recent immigrants who have not worked in the U.S. long enough to move into mid-to-high-wage jobs. To address this possibility, we estimate the age distribution again, this time only for workers who have lived in the U.S. for at least one decade. Figure 2 displays the results. These estimates are very similar to the numbers in Figure 1, indicating that recent immigration does not explain those age patterns.\nAlthough we do not have state-level data tracking specific individuals over long periods of time, the monthly CPS provides reasonably consistent measurements of workers’ ages and wages every month from 2002 through 2023. In this section, we aggregate data over this period to track cohorts of workers born in the same year to see how their rates of low-wage work change as they get older.\nCohort Example. Consider, for example, workers born in 1981. Using the repeated waves of the CPS, we estimate the share of such workers in low-wage jobs at age 25, age 26, and so on. Although those survey participants generally will not be the same individuals over time, this approach can give us a rough sense of workers’ mobility from low-wage jobs to mid-to-high-wage jobs. That said, other factors can affect these estimates to some degree. For example, when people born in 1981 enter or leave the labor force or migrate into or out of the state, that also affects our estimates.\nDefinition of Low-Wage Workers: Below 20th Percentile. In this section, we classify a job with a wage below the 20th percentile of the hourly wage distribution as a low-wage job. In contrast to the $17.50 per hour definition used in the prior section and another post, this definition has a consistent interpretation over a 20-year period.\nRate of Low-Wage Work Declines Substantially From Ages 25 to 32. As shown in Figure 3, our estimates suggest that the share of workers in low-wage jobs declines by more than one-third between the ages of 25 and 32. This decline suggests that a substantial share of workers spend just a handful of years in low-wage jobs before moving on to mid-to-high-wage jobs.\nMuch Lower Mobility After Age 32. Strikingly, net mobility out of low-wage work seems to stop abruptly when workers are in their early 30s. Between the ages of 32 and 40, the estimated rate of low-wage work declines so slowly that it is nearly flat. Of course, some workers at these ages presumably move from low-wage jobs to mid-to-high-wage jobs, but such movement does not appear to be much larger than movement in the opposite direction.\nSubstantial Share of Workers in Their Late Thirties Are in Low-Wage Jobs. Many workers are still in low-wage jobs as they approach middle age. When a cohort of workers reaches their late thirties, their rate of low-wage work has declined by less than half since they were 25. Some of these middle-aged low-wage workers are people who have recently entered or re-entered the labor force. That said, the overall labor force participation rate changes very little from age 25 to 40. This suggests that many low-wage workers in their late 30s likely have worked for many years with little upward mobility in their wages.\nLow-Wage Careers Appear to be Common. Although the two sets of estimates presented above are based on different approaches and different time periods, a coherent story emerges. Low-wage workers tend to be younger than mid-to-high-wage workers. As workers age from their 20s to their early 30s, many of them move from low-wage jobs to mid-to-high-wage jobs. Mobility out of low-wage work, however, slows down dramatically when workers are in their early 30s. As a result, half of low-wage workers are over 35 and one-quarter are 50 or older. The state’s economic policies should reflect the fact that many workers hold relatively low-wage jobs through middle age and beyond.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Watch the first Obama-Biden rally live at 3p.m. ET on www.BarackObama.com. Spread the word!” the text message read. The brief mobile alert was sent to most supporters just after 3 a.m. ET. Biden, who himself made a bid for the nomination, joined Obama at a major rally in Springfield, Ill. Saturday, kicking off the first of a series of events leading to the Democratic National Convention in Denver next week. At the rally, Obama introduced Biden to the crowd of thousands as his running mate, calling him a “leader who is ready to step in and be president.” Obama said Biden was “what many others pretend to be — a statesman with sound judgment who doesn’t have to hide behind bluster to keep America strong,” according to the Associated Press. Biden quickly went on the offensive during his remarks at the rally, attacking GOP rival Sen. John McCain and linking him to President Bush. “We cannot as a nation stand four more years of this,” Biden said. “You can’t change America when you supported George Bush’s policies 95 percent of the time.” Reaction to the pick emerged throughout the day from Biden’s Senate colleagues and Obama’s former rival for the nomination — and rumored running mate possiblity — Sen. Hillary Clinton. “Sen. Biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help Sen. Obama both win the presidency and govern this great country,” Clinton said in a statement. Even some GOP senators chimed in with their praise for Biden as the pick. “I congratulate Sen. Barack Obama on his selection of my friend, Sen. Joe Biden, to be his vice-presidential running mate. I have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with Joe Biden to bring strong bipartisan support to United States foreign policy,” said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., in a statement. Word finally leaked of the selection shortly after midnight Saturday, after reports and rumors about the nomination rattled around the Internet and cable news outlets. First the name of U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards of Texas emerged as a possible contender during the day Friday, unexpectedly joining a list that already included Biden, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. But the primetime news came and went without any announcement. Then, late in the evening, word came out that both Kaine and Bayh had been informed that they were not the running mate pick. Finally around 12:48 a.m. ET the first Associated Press wire story moved citing a Democratic official confirming Biden as the nominee. During his unsuccessful run for president, Biden had gained some traction with voters by stressing the need to thoughtful leadership on foreign policy matters, an area in which Obama has far less experience. Speaking to supporters just before the Iowa Caucuses he said, “I want all the caucus-goers in this great state to close their eyes and imagine: If their candidate is president of the United States, not in a year but this very instant, are they confident that they have the sure-footedness, the steady enough hand to know exactly what they would do in Pakistan? To know exactly what they would do — not generically — exactly what they would do in Iraq? Are they ready? Because, ladies and gentlemen, they are going to have to act.” This ability to deal with foreign policy issues was on display earlier this week when Biden was invited by the embattled president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, to visit Georgia in the midst of its crisis with Russia. The Biden selection was widely seen as a move to bolster Obama’s limited foreign policy and national security experience and no sooner had the unofficial word leaked, than the McCain camp was using the pick to question the Ill. senator’s readiness to lead. McCain spokesman Ben Porritt said in a statement that Biden had “denounced Barack Obama’s poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what Americans are quickly realizing — that Barack Obama is not ready to be president.” The McCain camp also swiftly released video of Biden criticizing Obama during early Democratic primary debates. Biden ended his bid for the Democratic nomination in after a disappointing fifth-place finish in Iowa, eventually coming out for Obama over his other Senate colleague Hillary Clinton. Although he had earlier told FOX News he had no interest in the number two slot, Biden had said on the NewsHour in November 2007 how he had been struck by the personal desire he felt to lead the country and tackle the issues facing the country. “[W]hen I started, I wondered whether I’d have the passion and the energy to do this. What has surprised me, I feel more passionate about the possibilities for this country than I did when I was 29 years old and elected to the Senate,” Biden said at the time. A plain-spoken senator, he is also known for the occasional, costly verbal gaffe. During his latest run for president, he drew fire for describing Obama as “the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.” And a speech partially plagiarized from a British Labor leader torpedoed his 1988 run for the White House. But despite those rhetorical problems, the vice presidential nomination would be another step in a political career that has spanned more than three decades. Elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democratic wunderkind in 1972 at age 29, Biden is currently in his sixth term representing Delaware. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he criticized President Bush’s handling of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In his speech announcing his presidential run, Biden described the Iraq war as “the greatest foreign policy disaster of our time.” He also put forward the controversial idea of partitioning Iraq into three largely sovereign regions — one for Kurds in the north, Sunni in the center and Shiites in the south. Prior to the Senate, Biden served on the New Castle County Council in Delaware from 1970 to 1972 and was a practicing attorney in Wilmington. In his November interview, he reflected on how his personal challenges had affected his outlook on politics. “[T]here’s millions of Americans who have gone through difficult things. So I don’t know how it affects the voters, but I know how it affected me,” Biden told Judy Woodruff. “It makes me realize that there’s nothing that is critical other than life and death and that there is a solution to almost every problem.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

To believe that in this country there is no obstacle that could keep you from your dreams if you are willing to work hard and fight for it. I was different. I was an Irish-Catholic kid from Scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times, but my mom and dad raised me to believe — it's a saying, Barack, you heard me say before — my dad repeated it and repeated it. Said champ, it's not how many times you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. It's how quickly you get up. Ladies and gentlemen, that's your story. That's America's story. It's about if you get up, you can make it.\nThat's the America Barack Obama and I believe in. That's the American dream. And ladies and gentlemen, these are no ordinary times, and this is no ordinary election. Because the truth of the matter is, and you know it, that American dream under eight years of Bush and McCain, that American dream is slipping away. I don't have to tell you that. You feel it in your lives. You see it in your shrinking wages, and the cost of everything from groceries to health care to college to filling up your car at the gas station. It keeps going up and up and up, and the future keeps receding further and further and further away as you reach for your dreams. You know, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a mere political saying. I say with every fiber of my being I believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this. We cannot afford to keep giving tax cuts after tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans while the middle-class America, middle-class families are falling behind and their wages are actually shrinking. We can't afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse. As you know, it's not just the millions of people facing foreclosure. It's the tens of millions of your neighbors who are seeing the values of their homes drop off a cliff along with their dreams.\nLadies and gentlemen, your kitchen table is like mine. You sit there at night before you put the kids, after you put the kids to bed and you talk, you talk about what you need. You talk about how much you're worried about being able to pay the bills. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's not a worry John McCain has to worry about. It's a pretty hard experience. He'll have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at. Folks, again, it's not political sloganeering when I say we literally can't afford four more years of this non-energy policy written by and for the oil companies, making us more and more dependent from hostile nations on our ability to run this country and literally, not figuratively, literally putting America's security at risk; we can't afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrificed our moral standing around the world.\nLadies and gentlemen, that's the bad news. But there is good news, America. We don't have to have four more years of George W. Bush and John McCain. The next president of the United States is going to be delivered to the most significant moment in American history since Franklin Roosevelt. He will have such an incredible opportunity, incredible opportunity, not only to change the direction of America but literally, literally to change the direction of the world. Barack Obama and I believe, we believe with every fiber in our being that our families, our communities as Americans, there's not a single solitary challenge we cannot face if we level with the American people. And I don't say that to say it; history, history has shown it. When have Americans ever, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down when they've had a leader to lead them?\nLadies and gentlemen, we believe that our tomorrows will be better than our yesterdays, and we believe we'll pass on to our children an even better life than the one we lived. That literally has been the American way, and it can be that way again. But there's a big, missing piece. The missing piece is leadership.\nIn all my time in the United States Senate, and I want you to know there's only four senators senior to me, but Barack, there's still 44 older than me. I want you to know that part. But all kidding aside, of all my years in the Senate, I have never in my life seen Washington so broken. I have never seen so many dreams denied and so many decisions deferred by politicians who are trying like the devil to escape their responsibility and accountability. But, ladies and gentlemen, the reckoning is now. And the reality, the reality is that we must answer the call or we will risk the harshest version and verdict of history. These times call for a total change in Washington's worldview. These times require more than a good soldier. They require a wise leader. A leader — a leader who can deliver. A leader who can deliver the change we need.\nI'll say straight up to you — John McCain, and the press knows this, is genuinely a friend of mine. I've known John for 35 years. He served our country with extraordinary courage and I know he wants to do right by America. But the harsh truth is, ladies and gentlemen, you can't change America when you boast. And these are John's words, quote, the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush. Ladies and gentlemen, that's what he said. You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time. You can't change America when you believe, and these are his own words, that in the Bush administration we've made great progress economically. You can't change America and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to Bush's scheme of privatizing Social Security. You can't change America and give our workers a fighting chance when after 3 million manufacturing jobs disappeared, you continue to support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas. You can't change America and end this war in Iraq when you declare and, again, these are John's words, no one has supported President Bush in Iraq more than I have, end of quote. Ladies and gentlemen, you can't change America, you can't change America when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of George Bush's presidency.\nMy friends — yes, we can. My friends, I don't have to tell you, this election year the choice is clear. One man stands ready to deliver change we desperately need. A man I'm proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next president of the United States, Barack Amer –\nYou know, you learn a lot of things being up close with a guy. Let me tell you about Obama. You learn a lot about a man when you campaign with him. When you debate him 12 or 13 times. When you hear him speak. When you see how he thinks. And you watch how he reacts under pressure. You learn a lot about his strength of his mind, and I think even more important, the quality of his heart. Ladies and gentlemen, no one knows better than I do that presidential campaigns are crucibles in which you're tested and challenged every single day. And over the past 18 months, I've watched Barack meet those challenges with judgment, intelligence, and steel in his spine. I've watched as he's inspired millions of Americans, millions of Americans to this new cause.\nAnd during those 18 months, I must tell you, frankly, I've been disappointed in my friend, John McCain, who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift-boat politics that he so — once so deplored. And folks, campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership. And in this campaign, one candidate, one candidate has passed that test.\nBarack has the vision, and what you can't forget, you know his vision, but let me tell you something. He also has the courage, the courage to make this a better place, and let me tell you something else, this man is a clear-eyed pragmatist who will get the job done. I watched with amazement as he came to the Senate. I watched with amazement. He made his mark literally from Day 1 reaching across the aisle to pass legislation to secure the world's deadliest weapons, standing up to some of the most entrenched interests in Washington, risking the wrath of the old order to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation. But I was proudest, I was proudest, when I watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of America's wounded warriors at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Ladies and gentlemen, I know I'm told I talk too colloquially, but there's something about this guy. There's something about this guy. There's something about Barack Obama that allows him to bring people together like no one I've worked with and seen. There's something about Barack Obama that makes people understand if they make compromises they can make things better.\nIt's been amazing to watch him. But then again, that's been the story of his whole life. I end where I began. This is a man raised by a single mother who sometimes was on food stamps as she worked to put herself through school; by grandparents from the prairies of Kansas who loved him, a grandfather, a grandfather who marched in Patton's Army and then came home and went to college on the GI Bill, and a grandmother, a grandmother with just a high school education, started off working in a small bank in the secretarial pool and rose to be vice president of that bank. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, these remarkable people gave Barack Obama the determination and drive, and, yes, the values to turn down that big job on Wall Street, to come to Chicago's South Side, where he helped workers help themselves after the steel mills had been shut down and the jobs disappeared.\nLadies and gentlemen, my wife, Jill, who you'll meet soon, is drop-dead gorgeous. My wife, Jill, who you'll meet soon, she also has her doctorate degree, which is a problem. But all kidding aside, my Jill, my Jill, my wife, Jill, and I are honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey, because that's what it is. It's a journey. We share the same values, the values that we had passed on to us by our parents and the values Jill and I are passing on to our sons Beau and Hunter and Ashley.\nLadies and gentlemen, I'm here for their future; I'm here for the future of your kids. I'm here for everyone I — I'm here for everyone I grew up [with] in Scranton, Pennsylvania, who's been forgotten and everybody in Claymont, Delaware, in Wilmington where I lived. I'm here for the cops and the firefighters, the teachers and the line workers, the folks who live — the folks whose lives are the measure of whether the American dream endures.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is no ordinary time. This is no ordinary election. And this may be our last chance to reclaim the America we love, to restore America's soul. Ladies and gentlemen, America gave Jill and me our chance. It gave Barack and Michelle their chance to stand on this stage today. It's literally incredible. These values, this country gave us that chance. And now it's time for all of us, as Lincoln said, to put our feet in the right place and to stand firm. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to elect Barack Obama president. It's our time. It's America's time. God bless America, and may he protect our troops.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Obama And Biden Launch First Campaign Tour\nBarack Obama begins his battleground bus tour in Springfield, Ill., the place where he announced his candidacy for the presidency.\nLIANE HANSEN, host:\nThis is Weekend Edition from NPR News. I'm Liane Hansen. Earlier this year, they were rivals. Now, they're running mates. Senator Barack Obama has selected Delaware Senator Joe Biden to stand with him at the Democratic Convention in Denver this coming week. The two men appeared together for the first time as a ticket yesterday in the Illinois capital of Springfield. NPR's Don Gonyea was there.\nDON GONYEA: For weeks, speculation had been building. Who would be Senator Obama's running mate? Names flew. There were short lists, long shots. In recent weeks, there were appearances with possible VPs in Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico. But yesterday in Springfield was no tease.\nSenator BARACK OBAMA (Presidential Candidate, Democrat): Today, I have come back to Springfield to tell you that I found that leader.\n(Soundbite of crowd applause)\nSen. OBAMA: A man with a distinguished record. A man with fundamental decency. And that man is Joe Biden.\nGONYEA: Senator Obama stood on a stage in front of the old state capital in Springfield. This was the exact spot where he first announced his bid for the White House in early 2007. The big reason Obama selected Biden is experience, the 65-year-old Delaware senator's three and a half decades in the Senate and his long foreign policy resume as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nSen. OBAMA: Over the last eight years, he has been a powerful critic of the catastrophic Bush-McCain foreign policy.\n(Soundbite of crowd applause)\nSen. OBAMA: And a voice - and a voice for a new direction that takes the fight to the terrorists and ends the war in Iraq responsibly.\nGONYEA: There was one slight slip-up yesterday when Obama introduced Biden as the next president of the United States. After a quick correction, Biden appeared, jogging along the runway, greeting his new running mate. Both men were in short sleeves on a hot, sunny day. They waved to the crowd of 35,000.\nEarlier this year, when Biden was still hoping to be president, he said Obama was too inexperienced. Here's what Biden says now.\nSenator JOE BIDEN (Democrat, Delaware): No one knows better than I do. The presidential campaigns are crucibles in which you're tested and challenged every single day. And over the past 18 months, I've watched Barack meet those challenges with judgment, intelligence and steel in his spine.\nGONYEA: And Joe Biden seemed ready to take on a basic role that nearly all vice-presidential nominees play: attacking the opposition. There was a reference to how many houses Republican John McCain owns, a question McCain himself had trouble answering last week. Then there was this:\nSen. BIDEN: I'll say straight up to you, John McCain and the press know this, he's genuinely a friend of mine. I've known John for 35 years.\nGONYEA: And he praised McCain's courage and long service to the country.\nSen. BIDEN: Harsh truth is, ladies and gentlemen, you can't change America when you boast, and these are John's words, quote, \"The most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement in support of President Bush.\"\n(Soundbite of crowd booing)\nSen. BIDEN: Ladies and gentlemen, that's what he said. You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time.\nGONYEA: Watching all of these from half a block away was Pam Brusant(ph), a sales and marketing coordinator.\nMs. PAM BRUSANT: I was interested in Biden early on before everybody started dropping by the wayside, and he's got longevity in the Senate and he's got the international background and I think he's a good man.\nGONYEA: Meanwhile, 64-year-old Lynn Davis(ph) has been an Obama supporter from the beginning, but she wanted someone else to run with him.\nMs. LYNN DAVIS: I was absolutely sure it was going to be Hillary. It would be a big surprise and it would draw her supporters in and that could be a really neat thing to have a woman and a black person.\nGONYEA: Indeed, the Biden pick will be judged on how much he helps heal the wounds of the primary war between Obama and Senator Clinton. If Senator Biden can appeal to the voters who preferred Clinton, he could make all the difference. Don Gonyea, NPR News.\nCopyright © 2008 NPR. All rights reserved.

By comparison, approximately 1.2 million service members have been killed in every war in U.S. history, according to estimates from the Department of Veterans Affairs and iCasualties.org, a website that maintains an ongoing database of casualties from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nSunday's massacre in Las Vegas — which left 59 dead and 530 others injured — is the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. And such attacks are becoming more common.\nRelated: Trump: Las Vegas Shooter 'Sick' and 'Demented Man'\n\"What we've seen in Las Vegas is an uniquely American scene,\" former FBI agent Ali Soufan said on MSNBC. \"The aftermath of such traumatic events have become an all too familiar scene in our society and in our politics, unfortunately.\"\nThe June 2016 shooting at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people, is now the second deadliest attack, followed by the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, which killed 26 people, most of them children.\nRelated: Silencers, armor-piercing bullets: Congress looks to roll back gun laws\nAfter the Sandy Hook shooting, a tearful President Barack Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at curbing violence in America. The orders included a measure to overturn a 20-year-old amendment that prevented the CDC from conducting federally funded research into how gun violence affects Americans.\nBut despite the elimination of the ban, the agency has remained hesitant to comprehensively research one of the most divisive issues in America. Many activists blame the influence that the NRA and other powerful pro-gun lobbies seem to have on some members of Congress, and the agency's fear that funding could be reduced or revoked.\nRelated: The War in Afghanistan: By the Numbers\nAs President Trump departed Tuesday for a visit to Puerto Rico, he ignored shouted questions on whether the Las Vegas shooting should prompt stricter gun control laws.

Each year, the number of firearm-related deaths reach almost the equivalent of U.S. casualties in Korean War.\n| ► 2016 New version available!\nThis visualization has been updated. Have a look at the new version here: [Visualization] More Americans have died from guns since 2001 than in Korean and Vietnam wars |\n| ► Please note that this post simply visualize the informations contained in Nicholas Kristof’s and Louis Jacobson’s articles (links below), who discuss precisely the nature and consistency of the data (read them before taking this data visualization as a simple pro- or anti-gun campaign). |\nCC-BY-SA Data visualization freely reusable with a link to this post.\nIn a recent article, Louis Jacobson (@loujacobson) fact-checked the information published by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof). Reacting to the murder of two journalists in Virginia, Kristof cited the calculation set by Mark Shields three years ago on PBS: “since Robert Kennedy died in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in all the wars of this country’s history”. On politifact.com, Jacobson updated the figures and validated the assertion of Kristof. Based on a study of the Congressional Research Service and reports relating to most recent conflicts, he shows that 1,396,733 Americans were killed on the battlefields. Governmental reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that there have been 1,516,863 gun-related deaths since 1968 (included suicides).\nThe visualization above is a simple contribution to the understanding of this reality.\nI would like to know what the percentage for black males in war time and since 68. I am sure it is wildly disproportionate. Even if you adjust the ratio for the Civil War.\nI rather doubt the conclusion. The data is likely skewed is some shape or form.\nI totally agree with you, these data should not be interpreted in a moral sense. But this does not prevent the factual comparison (as the purpose is simply to show a fact and not a political conclusion itself): it is a fact that a number of lives were lost in a certain situation and another number of lives in another situation. Remember that I do simply illustrate Nicholas Kristof’s quote and that this issue about interpretative limits is discussed in his column and in the analysis of Jacobson.\nmost gun related death stats include suicides which is one way the stats get skewed.\nAs you may know, a suicide with a gun is a “firearm-related death” (Thank you, Captain Obvious!). 😉\nRick, how could that fact skew the data? The easy availability of guns inproves the success rate of suicides. Here in Australia the firearm related suicides dramatically declined after we introduced controls on gun availability. We did not ban guns, we made access to them, even for permit holders, less impulsive and removed from our national psychy that a gun is a piece of home safety equipment. If gun ownership was actually related to safety families with guns would be safer right? So why do the stats say just the opposite. To all but the brainwashed its obvious. Access to firearms at the point of impulse is dangerous. Controling it (not banning it) is a balanced, rational and effective response.\nWhat an excellent analysis! “Access to guns at the point of impulse is dangerous. ” There yu have it.\nWell said!!! A convincing logical argument backed by evidence ….too bad politicians can’t make them — they are too busy pandering, acting or stealing, or getting elected.\nYet you neglect to mention that the overall suicide rate in Australia did not change as hangings rose. Same thing happened in Australia: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16476153\nSame thing in Canada.\nso I would like to see another research showing how many of these gun deaths were at the hands of criminals who broke the law by doing so. then compare it to how many of them used legal guns. then compare it to how many of those deaths would have been avoided if it would have been against the law to murder someone. then tell me how by taking gun away fro law abiding decent people would prevent bad people who have no regard for the laws from breaking the law.\nYour right, it is skewed by including suicides. They author wants you to infer that the suicides would not have happened if there were no guns.\nNo, it is not “skewed” to include suicides. Suicide attempts that involve guns are far more likely to be “successful” than those that utilize other means (cutting, overdosing on medication, etc.). Often people feel suicidal in the moment, and then change their mind later. If access to guns was more difficult, more people would get that second chance, and there would be fewer suicides.\nNot true. The post-Sandy Hook research ordered by President Obama found that suffocation has equal efficacy. Japan has a much higher suicide rate, minus the firearms.\nPLEASE tell me this statement is a joke? Your from the NRA?\nHow so? Our suicide rate by firearm has declined sharply since we controled access. As an ex cop, RN, ex gun owner and suicide prevention volunteer I can tell you for sure that firearm suicide attempts are more likley to be successfull and cause more harm to those attending than other popular methods. Community harm by firearm suicide is a very real and valid metric.\n“Trends in hanging and firearm suicide rates in Australia: substitution of method?”\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12882416\nNo, there is no implication that there would be no suicides without guns. The author simply cites statistics; we can draw our own conclusions. Like several others who responded here, I find it fascinating that those who criticize the gun-related death rates argue that the statistics are inflated by including suicides. Clearly, whether you want to kill yourself or someone else, easily available guns increase the effectiveness of the action. If that were not the case, people would not want to own guns. Having a gun greatly increases the odds that a spur of the moment suicide attempt will be successful, with far less possibility of changing your mind.\nYou could say numbers are skewed because the deaths in war also include friendly fire, suicides and accidents outside of the battlefield. Remove those casualties and you will have dramatically different numbers.\nThis is a comparison of deaths in war and deaths from the barrel of a gun. Stop trying to dismiss the data to suit your agenda.\nMost suicides are from overdose so we should outlaw doctors and pills.\nStupid remark. Skewed reasoning. Gun nut.\nA flat-out lie, this. Isn’t it? Actually suicide by gun is the single most popular method in the US, accounting for more than half of all suicides. Here are the CDC figures:\nAll suicides\nNumber of deaths: 41,149\nDeaths per 100,000 population: 13.0\nFirearm suicides\nNumber of deaths: 21,175\nDeaths per 100,000 population: 6.7\nSuffocation suicides\nNumber of deaths: 10,062\nDeaths per 100,000 population: 3.2\nPoisoning suicides\nNumber of deaths: 6,637\nDeaths per 100,000 population: 2.1\nAnd we do attempt to restrict access to drugs that can easily be used for self-harm, don’t we? Time to do the same thing with guns, then, isn’t it?\nmost suicides attempts by pill are not successful. only about 25%.\nits actually very hard to commit suicide by most methods.\nand most people who attempt suicide, and live to tell about it, do so because they suddenly find the urge to live, and call 911, or help, or something.\nGuns don’t have that option. There is no second chance when you blow your brains out, like there is with most other methods.\nonly 10% of all suicide attempts are successful.\nbut over 90% of suicide attempts using a gun are successful.\nattempted suicides would still happen.\nthe difference is, most suicide attempts are unsuccessful.\nonly 1 in 10 (10%) of all attempted suicides is successful, across all methods.\n** but looking strictly at suicide by firearms , the success rate is more than 90% !! **\nso yes, fewer guns DOES reduce the number of successful suicides, quite a bit.\npeople who are suicidal will still attempt it at roughtly the same rate,\n** but they will be successful LESS OFTEN **\nYou are right!\nOne cannot “skew” data that is all too inclusive.\nAbsent is the breakdown of those killed by cops, and those killed while committing crimes. That is correct, “justifiable homicide” is INCLUDED.\nMissing in the suicide debate is the issue of the tool/weapon of choice. No gun, knife, poison, jumping, or other methods. Those who wish to kill themselves, will use many means.\nWhere guns have been removed form society, other implements are used to commit murder, look at the problem in Israel, “suicide knifings,” but who notices without guns or bombs?\nIt is skewed, but not for that reason. It’s skewed because a better and more accurate measure would be a year-by-year percentage derived from the ratio of people who have died from guns vs the whole population. The author forgets that back in the 18th and 19th centuries the USA had a much lower total population than we do now…so while less deaths may have occurred from firearms in the Revolutionary War, for example, there were also less people overall back then so the deaths likely still represented an extremely significant percentage of the total population…and I would wager a far more significant percentage than today’s figures. I would also wager that the skewing also comes from the figure likely including criminals who died from being shot by their would-be victims. I’m sorry but given a choice between using force of arms to fight back to protect myself and others from criminals and letting those criminals run roughshod over me, my money is on fighting back. Fighting back is the only effective deterrent. Sit there and cower in a corner and all you do is show the home invader that you’re a soft target who doesn’t have the gumption to fight.\nNot necessarily skewed, but let’s put it in perspective, shall we? In 2013, we had:\nUnintentional fall deaths: 30,208\nMotor vehicle traffic deaths: 33,804\nUnintentional poisoning deaths: 38,851\nSource: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/accidental-injury.htm\nSo that means that there most likely have also been more “unintentional fall deaths”, “motor vehicle traffic deaths”, and “unintentional poisoning deaths” (each individually) than deaths “on battlefields of all the wars in American history” as well? Oh… Inconvenient for the intended effect of this graphic, isn’t it? :/\nThere isn’t a “conclusion.” it’s just raw data.\nIt is “too” raw.\nALL seems to include data from deaths that could be ruled “justifiable.”\nIn many “gun-free” counties, the knife has supplanted the gun as a means of killing.\nEvil intentions will thrive and use whatever devices are available.\nMy calculator says that 8,110,150 people were killed in war. 1,516,863 were killed by homespun gunfire, according to the graph above. Somebody’s lying, and doing a poor job of it. Must be an Obama-ite.\nSorry for the wrong numbers. Must have double clicked a number when calculating. The eight million figure is definitely wrong. My apologies.\nIn which case you should also apologise for the “Obama-ite” which has nothing to do with this discussion.\nThe interesting fact is that suicide rates are twice the homicide rate.\nAlso doesn’t compensate for gen pop size\n@Hugh jass We are talking about human lives lost, not percentages of the population lost. Weighted analysis is interesting if you want to show the impact of wars on each years/periods, not the total of the individuals.\n@J Jung Maybe, but it does not change the statistical fact: there was x firearm-related deaths in year x. These statistics do not count the kind of dead but their context or vector. Moreover, you know that the debate exists on the impact of the regulation of firearms on suicide (but discussing this question is not the role of the statistician).\nInteresting study. I don’t see any practical use for the data, however. The comparison of firearm-related deaths among the population of the United States between a contiguous period of time from 1968 until 2015 vs. “total deaths” as a result of war for shorter periods of time among significantly lesser populations (directly affected by the conflicts) from 1775 until 2015, is irrelevant. You might as well compare the amount of rice consumed in Japan during typhoon season from 1775 until 2015 against the amount of rice consumed in China from 1968 until 2015.\nThis article is misleading, sensationalist and headline grabbing because it includes suicide deaths by firearms, which account for about 64% of firearm-related deaths. Also, the suicide rate is approximately the same for people who kill themselves with a firearm vs a non-firearms means – implying that if a person does not have access to a firearm, there is little stopping a person intent on suicide from doing so (like swallowing pills). If suicide deaths by firearm are excluded, the real figure of Americans who have experienced homicide by guns is a third of what is claimed – and therefore a third of the Americans who have died in wars.\nTo arrive at these figures, I used the tool referenced (http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html) to find the following facts:\n* From 2000-2013, there were 80k deaths from non-firearm homicide in the US\n* From 2000-2013, there were 160k deaths from firearm homicide\n* In this period there were 235k suicides by non-firearms .\n* There were 253k suicides by firearms (64% of firearm deaths)\n* US men kill themselves twice as much as women; and 4/5ths of suicides are by white people, which I did not expect.\n* For comparison, motor vehicle related deaths in this period were 575k people.\nI couldn’t find year on year data from 1968-2015 to break down suicide vs homicide gun deaths, but if we extrapolate the same suicide rate and gun-related death rate to previous years (and it seems from the bar charts that the firearm death rate is about the same), it seems that the 1.5 million figure cited = 32,000 firearm deaths a year (1.5M/47); and 36% of 32k = 11,000 people a year die from firearm homicides. Or, about a third of 1.5M.\nThis is not to say that more regulation of guns is not needed – one needs more regulation to register a car and learn to use one. Cars are weapons and guns are too. But lying with statistics is no way to sell the cause – it does the opposite – it undermines the cause. Let’s be honest.\nAlso, of all homicide firearm deaths, 139k (87%) of these deaths were men. Of these men, 55K (40%) were white, and 80k (58%) were black. One wonders why only 13% of homicide victims are women, but it seems to say something about the habits of women. After all, 90% of the prison population is male – that’s just a fact.\nMen are “naturally” more physically aggressive. They also have traditionally been interfacing with the outside competitive world with all its inherent conflicts. Unfortunately, in this “dog eat dog” world they may not bite, all too often they shoot.\nCars are transportation and insured for the accidents that cause fatalities. Talk about skewing the facts.\nIt is not lying at all, however that is a common misconception. Suicide via gun results in an american death by gun. This article makes no claim that the data only includes homicides, and the title makes no such claim either. In fact, it would be a manipulation of the data to omit suicide by firearm after stating that the data includes all Americans killed by guns. While a suicidal person may well seek out other means without access to a gun, gun related suicides are known to have a much higher rate of success. Remember, gun violence is not limited to homicide.\n.[1] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013, firearms (excluding BB and pellet guns) were used in 84,258 nonfatal injuries (26.65 per 100,000 U.S. citizens) [2] and 11,208 deaths by homicide (3.5 per 100,000),[3] 21,175 by suicide with a firearm,[4] 505 deaths due to accidental discharge of a firearm,[4] and 281 deaths due to firearms-use with “undetermined intent”[5] for a total of 33,169 deaths related to firearms (excluding firearm deaths due to legal intervention). 1.3% of all deaths in the country were related to firearms.[1][6] copy and paste from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States\nSo when i look at these how many could be prevented gun violence by making a law that already has been made ??? Homicide is already illegal, suicide illegal but if no gun then many other options, 505 a very small % by accidental discharge is hunting accidents and we have the right to hunt our own food? Education of our children, and financial opportunity are the only things that will improve our situation.\nThis is directly from the CDC site you can’t get data from 1968 to present from the CDC, I tried and the latest it will go back is 1999. After I paste this text I will include the link on the CDCsite and the form where you can tinker with you own data statistics, all from the CDC website.\n5.1.3 Data Element: Year(s) of Report\nYou can request an injury mortality report for data from 1999 and later or for 1981 to 1998. If you desire a report for a single year, enter the same year in both of the Year(s) of Report fields (e.g., 1997 to 1997). Be aware that selecting a large number of years at a time may require a long response time. Also, note that you cannot request a report for 1999 and later and any year from 1981 to 1998. The external cause of injury coding for 1999 and later years, based on the ICD-10 classification system, is notably different from external cause coding for 1998 and earlier years, based on the ICD-9 classification system. You may not be able to compare numbers of deaths and deaths rates computed for some external causes of injury based on 1999 and later data to those based on data from 1998 and earlier. Consequently, use caution when doing trend analysis of numbers of deaths and death rates across these years. For more information, see Data Sources.\nCDC Link to fatal injury reports: search by cause, adverse effects, poisioning, ect.. http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html\nCDC Link sourcing the above text\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal_help/definitions_fatal.html#year\nIndividuals or groups who choose to use statistics to support their point of view should provide all “credible” sources and relevant data to support the claim. Stop the fear mongering. Criminals will always have guns and break the law. Allowing responsible citizens who have had proper training and certification to open carry a firearm would create a visible deterrent and reduce armed violence. Predators go after the low hanging fruit, easy prey, they tend to move in small groups, and try to avoid direct resistance and confrontation so they remain unscathed for their next assault.\nWhat a load of crap.\n1) If the potential victim is more likely to have a firearm then the perp is more likely to have a firearm. Most criminals carry a gun for protection.\n2) Many armed criminals do not think rationally especially as drugs and mental illness are involved, this means an armed victim is not a deterrent\n3) If lots of people are armed when an incident happens then multiple responses by witnesses will lead to innocent fatalities. Being fit to carry a gun does not mean you are trained to make split second decisions in pressure situations.\n4) For the same reason as 3, the more armed members of the public, the more likely there will be false positive reactions. That is shooting an unarmed person either a criminal who was not armed or a misreading of a situation. Such as a domestic argument interpreted as an assault.\n5) The more guns are carried the more accidental discharges there will be either by the owner or by their children.\nLook at the rest of the world my friend. Where else are they saying that to reduce gun deaths we need to increase the number of guns? It’s illogical.\nReally look at the gun related death figures and compare them to the rest of the world. Every country has criminals, every country has mental health issues. The difference ifs the access to the gun.\nAmen!\nThe answer to this problem is to repeal the second amendment and confiscate all guns.\n@kinsey6 like thats worked out for the good in the past http://www.mercyseat.net/gun_genocide.html\nThe Virginia “journalist” shooting was a hoax.\nFrom someone who lives in Roanoke, VA: bullshit and shame on you!\nIt is so interesting to notice some of the allergic reactions in the comments. As if reducing the amount of people who died by a third (in case you don’t count suicides in),is reducing “the harm” done to the image of gun possession. It’s still a bloody bad amount of deaths in a country which doesn’t officially has a civil war. Of course, it’s a way of keeping overpopulation on earth a little bit under control, but that surely wasn’t the point to be made. Guns seem to be considered as a part of the body; so limiting access to it feels like chopping off an arm. But hey guys, wake up. A society without guns us one with more trust in neighbours and higher safety. After the revolutions in Europe, the possession of guns was forbidden. What’s the harm? The Hollywood movies with large amount of aggressive shooting scenes are adding to the gun indoctrination.\nThere is a little overlap in these two groups. Many suicides by firearm have been a consequence of war. Many returning soldiers come back with the brain/psychological injuries that end up in suicide (because the number is not irrelevant, one should think hard wether to count it on the war column, instead of the other.\nThe yearly graph in the bottom right is misleading in that it shows 2015 as a dip, as the year is incomplete. You should draw it 75% the width and 1/.75 the height to represent the average accurately (assuming that the data goes up to September; adjust based on how many days you have data for).\nIn a long-term perspective you’re right (if somebody find the graph in a few months/years), but do you really think that this is not obvious to the reader today? (I’ll consider adding a note to this last bar if this post is still read in a few weeks)\nJust a few quick questions, how many gun deaths are from:\nillegally obtained guns\nRifles\nShot guns\nAccidental shootings\nI’m not trying to muddy the waters here but lumping all of these into the debate as one does skew the data. More laws for people who legally own or want to own guns is like making restrictions harder on all drivers to prevent drunk driving.\nIn the present day debate against private ownership of firearms on the premise that it endangers the safety of others, to produce such statistic that includes self-inflicted wounds (~70+%) is manipulative and serves no other purpose than to create shock value that has no logical meaning. It is no less manipulative than what the right wing marginal groups produce on various other issues.\nFirst off, ~70+% is a gross inflation of the ~63% that is actually gun suicides. Secondly, the article addresses suicides as directly as homicides, and is inherently apart of gun violence itself. It is illogical to assume that gun violence via homicide is all that matters. If my statistics are right, and there is certainly room for error, ~500,564 deaths by guns are homicide since 1968 and ~955,623 gun deaths are self inflicted. ~15,168 deaths have been accidental. These statistics can all be grouped under gun deaths, regardless of the cause. It is hardly manipulative if the article itself mentions suicide as a factor.\nWell, there already are a lot more restrictions on granting vehicle licenses than gun licenses. With regard to the earlier comments about suicide, it is disgusting to imply that suicide deaths somehow “don’t count,” as if those people’s deaths via guns are somehow less tragic. The United States has a unique issue with gun deaths, and a large part of the population has no interest in doing anything about it. That’s extremely sad.\nAll deaths are tragic, of course, but lumping homicides and suicides into a single stat produces logical nonsense. You can play on emotions, but it is superficial and lacks substance… then again would you have liked these suicides better if there were done by self-strangulation or jumping off bridges. How do they do it in France, actually, since they have fewer guns, but the suicide rate is astonishing? It is very easy to produce catchy emotional headlines like “Suicide count in France tops their WW-2 casualties”… or “French suicides top the USA gun homicides”..\nThe bottom line here — the United States is a country with its own distinct culture and traditions and populace that exercises their will. Feel sad not for the USA, cause I feel safer and happier here than most places and so do hundreds of millions of other people. I personally, feel sad about Europe with their old, stale, restrictive mindset… ban this, ban that.. it is very easy, indeed.. everything in Europe is harder to get done and more bureaucratic – in my experience, just lately – doing business, taxation, flying private aircraft, not to mention owning a gun… you have a different philosophy, this is great, but I love the USA, at least our suicide rates are lower, guns or no guns… and I can see why.\nSuicide rate via guns is somewhere around ~90% successful. That is a pretty high mortality rate. Your appeal to American tradition is equally flawed. While I also love the USA, it is logically foolish to assume that tradition and culture is a strong enough argument against changing laws which may save more American lives. And that is the real bottom line: whether stricter gun regulations will decrease gun violence and save American lives. What makes America wonderful isn’t its past, but its ability to change and become better. That is why I love the USA.\nWhy 1968?\nWe’ve been shooting each other longer than that.\nThe initial citation from Mark Shields on PBS: “since Robert Kennedy died in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968…”\nBS, the CDC number for “Violence related” deaths by firearm is 12,483 per year. you selected “All Intents” to come up with 31,500. the CDC’s number for non-firearms caused violence related deaths is almost 24,000 a year.\nThis is a great visualization, but I have one concern: why weren’t the Americans killed during the American Indian wars included? The U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894) provided an estimate of deaths due specifically to war during the 57 years between 1789 and 1846:\n“The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the number given… Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate…”\nGun violence should horrify us enough to take action. Car crashes should also shock us enough to take action, with 2,023,521 deaths between 1968 and 2013. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year\nNo matter the reason this chart was created, it is being hailed as a rallying cry for gun control. People die in wars in a multitude of ways, sometimes including getting shot by guns. In the Civil War, research suggests more than half of the deaths were caused by disease. What value is there comparing these disease-caused deaths to gun deaths in America in the late 20th century, other than using the excuse some journalist made the dumb comparison so lets create a chart?\nNote that a few will take this chart as an invitation to revoke the 2nd Amendment and “do something” about guns. I thought it would be interesting compare gun deaths in America in the late 20th Century with the amount of deaths caused by government itself in the 20th Century (not including wars). After all, if it is fair to compare these 1.5 million firearms death with non-related war deaths across the prior 150 years to generate sympathy for gun control, would it not be fair to compare these 1.5 million firearms deaths with those deaths caused by the very thing the 2nd Amendment was designed to ward off? Personally I hate the suggestion these 1.5 million deaths should be used in any comparison as if they are pawns to be moved on a chessboard, but I don’t make the rules. So here is the pro 2A analysis of this chart, adding a circle for people killed by their own governments in the 20th century. The 2nd Amendment is what protects Americans from having it happen to them, both today and hundreds of years in the future no matter who is President, what political party is in power, or how much disarming is desired by those who never study history.\nhttp://i1030.photobucket.com/albums/y369/brian-knight/democide-vs-gun-deaths-2_zpseezatbwg.jpg\n[URL=http://s1030.photobucket.com/user/brian-knight/media/democide-vs-gun-deaths-2_zpseezatbwg.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1030.photobucket.com/albums/y369/brian-knight/democide-vs-gun-deaths-2_zpseezatbwg.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nPut those numbers in terms of European gun violence (WW1 and WW2), and Socialist/Communists regime violence. EU World wars. 100+ million. Socialist/Communist regime “gun deaths” (Those with the guns vs those without the guns) 140 million. Even with that over inflated number of 31K per year, more than half are suicides (the US rate for suicide is very comparable to Europe’s even though they have few guns) and they lump in civilians/police killing criminals, 1.3 million seems like a very small price to pay compared to the butcher’s bill the rest of the “gun free” world has had to pay.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Countdown to America's 250th Anniversary: 7 months / 12 days\nStay updated on ABMC news and events from around the world.\nThe Florence American Cemetery and Memorial Battle Map renovation project will begin on Monday December 1, 2025.

CDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thanks for coming. It is a joy to be back in Alabama. And I appreciate your warm welcome. I am proud to stand with one of the nation's finest governors, and ask for your help in reelecting Bob Riley as Governor of Alabama. (Applause.)\nHe deserves to be reelected because he's got a record he can run on. He has made you proud. He listens to the people. He shares your values for the good of Alabama and for the good of all citizens, regardless of their political party. Bob Riley needs to be reelected as your governor. (Applause.)\nI'm proud to be here with Patsy, First Lady of the great state of Alabama. Riley and I married well. (Applause.) And we're both wise enough to listen to our wives. (Laughter.) So Laura said, when you get down to Alabama, say hello to our friends on her behalf, and so I do. I bring greetings from Laura Bush, a wonderful mother, a fantastic wife, and a great First Lady for the United States of America. (Applause.) And Patsy, thank you for being here. Thank you for serving your state with dignity, just like Riley is serving the state with dignity.\nI'm also proud to recognize the candidate for the Lieutenant Governor, a man who will stand tall for the state of Alabama -- (laughter) -- my friend, Luther Strange. (Applause.) I have gotten to know your State Attorney General, Troy King. He is an accomplished attorney, who brings great credit to the office he holds. (Applause.) I can say without a doubt, he's the right candidate to serve as the State Attorney for this great state of Alabama. Troy, thanks for serving. It was an honor to meet your wife, Paige. I want to thank the State Auditor, Beth Chapman, who is with us here today. (Applause.) I thank Twinkle Cavanaugh, who is the Chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, and I want to thank all the grass roots activists who have joined us here today.\nThis is a fantastic fundraiser. The next thing that needs to be done is a fantastic grass roots effort to turn out the vote. (Applause.) For those of you who are stuffing the envelopes and putting up the signs and getting on the telephones, and turning people out to vote, I want to thank you in advance for what you're going to do for this excellent governor.\nYou win campaigns by having somebody who has got a vision and can carry the message, and you also win campaigns by finding your voters and turning them out. For all the grass roots activists here today, thanks for coming, and thanks for what you do. (Applause.)\nI want to thank the state and local officials who are here. Thanks for serving. I appreciate your willingness to be a public servant. I want to thank the Selma High School Choir. I appreciate you lending your beautiful voices to this important occasion. (Applause.)\nOne of the most important jobs of a governor is to set a tone for a state. Bob Riley and I share a philosophy about the role of government when it comes to the economy. The role of government is not to create wealth; the role of government is to create an environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit can flourish, in which small business grow to be big businesses, an environment in which people are able to find work.\nI was noticing that the unemployment rate in the great state of Alabama is 3.5 percent, which says Riley knows what he's doing when it comes time to this economy. (Applause.) When you have people working, it makes sense to put the man in charge of setting the tone for the state back in office.\nYou know, one of the things Bob and I understand is that one way to grow the economy is to let people keep more of their own taxes. You see, we believe that when you've got more of your own money in your pocket to save, spend, or invest, the economy grows.\nHe told me that he's running on cutting taxes, another reason to put him back in office as the governor of Alabama. (Applause.) And I'm telling you, cutting taxes works.\nYou might remember what this economy of ours has been through. We've been through a recession, and corporate scandals, a terrorist attack, a war, hurricanes, and high gasoline prices. Yet we're growing, and we intend to keep growing. And the best way to keep growing is to keep the people's taxes low.\nThe tax cuts -- the tax cuts we passed are working, and it's a campaign issue as far as I'm concerned. There's no doubt in my mind that if the national Democrats had control of the House or the Senate, they'd raise your taxes. And there's no doubt in my mind raising your taxes will hurt this economy. The best way to keep the people in Alabama working, and the best way to keep the people across this country working is to make the tax cuts we passed permanent. (Applause.)\nWhen I was the governor of Texas, I used to tell people education is to a state what national defense is -- is to the federal government. The single most important priority of a state is to make sure the people get educated. (Applause.) And Bob Riley has made the school system of Alabama his top priority. But he's made the school system in Alabama a priority in a different kind of way. See, he refuses to accept the status quo when he finds mediocrity or failure.\nYou know, I was talking to Margaret Spellings. She's my buddy from the state of Texas who is now the Secretary of Education. And Margaret Spellings, if she were here, would tell you that Alabama has some of the most innovative programs in the United States of America when it comes to making sure every single child gets an education. You got a governor who is an education governor and needs to be returned to your state capitol. (Applause.)\nHe is spending money on schools, and that's important. But he also understands money alone won't bring excellence to the classrooms. And that's why he has set high standards. And that's why he insists upon strong accountability measures. The best way to achieve educational excellence for every child in your state is to measure, is to determine whether a child is learning how to read, write and add and subtract, and if not, correct problems early before it's too late.\nI'm proud of the standards your governor has set. I'm proud to call my friend an educational innovator. I'm proud that he has made reading a top priority. I'm proud he's challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations. I'm proud he's working hard to make sure no child is left behind in the state of Alabama. (Applause.)\nRiley and I just went over to -- excuse me -- Governor Riley -- (laughter) -- and I went over to Hoover, Alabama today, the home of the mighty Bucs, the number one high school football team in the United States. (Applause.) That's kind of hard for a Texan to say. (Laughter.) But we went over for a different reason, because we both understand that in order for America to remain competitive in the 21st century, in order for Alabama to remain competitive in the 21st century, we must diversify away from foreign sources of oil.\nAnd so we went to a E85 ethanol distribution place. See, what happened is, is that the fine mayor of Hoover and its city council decided that they were going to use ethanol as the primary fuel for their police automobiles. That's called innovation. It's called thinking ahead.\nI found it to be really interesting to talk to the officers who drive the vehicles that are run on fuel that is 85 percent ethanol -- in other words, fuel made from corn. So I said to the guy, do you -- see, he has a choice, he can either use gasoline or ethanol. I said, which one do you use? He says, I like the ethanol. I said, why? He said, it's got a lot of get up and go to it. In other words, it works well.\nWhat we're beginning to see is a change in how we fuel our automobiles. We're spending a lot of money at the federal level, your money, to try to advance new technologies to make us less dependent on oil. It's in the national interests that we become less dependent on oil from overseas. After all, a lot of the oil we get is from parts of the world that don't particularly care for us right now. (Applause.)\nI look forward to the day when more and more of you have flex-fuel vehicles and you can go and make the decision as to whether or not you want to use ethanol as the primary source of energy in your automobile or gasoline. I look forward to the day when I can say to the American people, because we've got more corn growing, we're less dependent on foreign sources of oil. I look forward to the day when you can use wood chips from Alabama trees as the feedstock for ethanol. I look forward to the day when we have these great breakthroughs of research and technology done right here in Auburn University to say to the American people, the research we're doing today means your children are going to be less dependent on oil in the future. (Applause.)\nAnd Bob Riley is a partner in encouraging diversification away from hydrocarbons that we import from overseas. And I appreciate his stance. I appreciate his vision. He's got a vision for the people of Alabama, and he's got the skill and capability of implementing that vision. He's done an excellent job for the people. And I want to thank you for supporting him to put him back in office. It's good for this state that Bob Riley is the governor. I want to talk about -- (applause.)\nI want to spend a little time on what else occupies my mind, other than making sure our economy grows. And it's this: My most solemn responsibility and the most solemn duty of the federal government, as a matter of fact governments at all levels, is to protect the American people. (Applause.)\nWe are a nation at war. I wish I could report differently, but you need to have a President who sees the world the way it is, not the way somebody would hope it would be. In order to protect this people, we must understand the nature of the threats we face. We face an enemy that is brutal, an enemy that is determined, and enemy that has a set of beliefs that is the opposite of our beliefs.\nI'll never forget the lessons of September the 11th, 2001, and I will continue to use, as I vowed then to the American people, every element of national power to defeat the terrorists and to defend the freedom of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nAnd that starts with making sure those responsible for defending you have all the tools necessary to do so. As the Commander-in-Chief of the finest group of men and women produced in this country, I'll make you this pledge: Our troops will have whatever it takes to do the job we have asked them to do. (Applause.)\nAnd we have got to make sure that our intelligence officers have the tools they need to protect you, and our law-enforcement officers have the tools they need to protect you. So working with the Congress, we passed what was called the Patriot Act, an act that broke down barriers and walls that prevented the intelligence community from sharing information with the law-enforcement community.\nYou see, we recognize that in order to protect you, all elements of national government must be able to communicate freely to defeat this enemy. If somebody that we think is al Qaeda or an al Qaeda affiliate gets on the telephone and is making a phone call into the United States, we want to know why, in order to protect the American people. (Applause.)\nIn order to make sure we get the information necessary to protect you -- see, this is a different kind of war. We cannot measure the enemy's progress based upon the movement of tanks or airplanes. These people hide in remote regions of the world and then strike with lethality, as we learned firsthand in our country.\nAnd therefore we must find kernels of information that then will enable us to track them down and bring them to justice before they hurt Americans. And that's why it's essential that I created a program with the professionals in the Central Intelligence Agency to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives that were captured on the battlefield. As a result of this program, we have -- we've learned information that enabled us to save American lives. (Applause.)\nI also believed it was important to set up military commissions that will enable us to bring to justice the people that ordered the attacks on the United States of America. (Applause.) The Supreme Court said, you must work with the legislature to achieve these objectives, and we're doing just that.\nLast night -- yesterday afternoon, the House of Representatives voted on the legislation we put forward to create military commissions and to continue that vital program of questioning detainees. The bill passed, but I want to remind you about the vote. The bill passed over the objections of 160 House Democrats, including the entire Democrat leadership.\nWe must give our professionals the tools necessary to protect the American people in this war on terror, and those in the House of Representatives were wrong to vote against this bill. (Applause.)\nOurs is an important job to protect you. We have to be right 100 percent of the time, and the enemy only has to be right once. And that's why it's important that we do the -- pass the laws that we've asked the Senate and the House to pass. And that's also why it's important that we must defeat the enemy overseas so we do not have to face them here at home. (Applause.)\nAnd there's a lot of debate in Washington about this war on terror. And perhaps you heard something about what's called a National Intelligence Estimate. The National Intelligence Estimate is a classified document that, in this case, analyzed the threat we faced from terrorists and extremists.\nAs you know, parts of that classified document were recently leaked to the press, a sure sign that elections are right around the corner. Some in the other party have been quoting selectively from the document for partisan political gain, and so I felt that it was important for people to actually see what was in the document, and so I declassified it.\nAnd I'd like to share some thoughts about what was in the NIE with you today. It offers a frank assessment of where we are in the war on terror. It confirms that we face a determined and capable enemy. It lists four underlying factors that are fueling the extremist movement: longstanding grievances such as corruption and injustice, or fear of Western domination; the second such factor was the \"jihad\" in the Iraq; the third was the slow pace of reform in Muslim nations; and the fourth factor that the leaders of this extremist movement were using to recruit was anti-Americanism.\nIt concludes that the terrorists are exploiting all these factors to enhance their movement. The debate over this document raises really an important question about the war on terror: should we be on the offense or not? Some in Washington -- some decent people, patriotic people, feel like we should not be on the offensive in this war on terror. Here's what a senior Democrat in Congress put it when she was discussing Iraq. She said, \"The President says that fighting them there makes it less likely we'll have to fight them here. The opposite is true,\" she went on to say. \"Because we are fighting them there, it may become more likely that we'll have to fight them here.\"\nHistory tells us that logic is false. We didn't create terrorism by fighting terrorism. Iraq is not the reason why the terrorists are at war against us. Our troops were not in Iraq when the terrorists first attacked the World Trade Center. They were not in Iraq when they blew up our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. They were not in Iraq when they bombed the USS Cole. And we were not in Iraq when the extremists killed nearly 3,000 of our people on September the 11th, 2001. (Applause.)\nFive years after the 9/11 attacks, some in Washington, D.C. still don't understand the nature of the enemy. The only way to protect our citizens at home is to keep the pressure on the enemy across the world. When terrorists spend their days working to avoid capture, they are less able to plot and plan and execute new attacks. We will stay on the offense. We will fight them across the world. And we will stay in this fight until the fight is won. (Applause.)\nIn order to win this war, we need to understand that the terrorists and extremists are opportunists. They will grab onto any cause to incite hatred and to justify the killing of innocent men, women and children. If we weren't in Iraq, they would be using our relationship and friendship with Israel as a reason to recruit, or the Crusades, or cartoons as a reason to commit murder. They recruit based upon lies and excuses. And they murder because of their raw desire for power. They hope to impose their dominion over the broader Middle East and establish a radical Islamic empire where millions are ruled according to their hateful ideology. We know this because al Qaeda has told us.\nThe terrorist Zawahiri, number two man in the al Qaeda team -- al Qaeda network, he said, we'll proceed with several incremental goals. The first stage is to expel the Americans from Iraq; the second stage is to establish an Islamic authority, then develop it and support it until it achieves the level of caliphate; the third stage, extend the jihad wave to secular countries neighboring Iraq; and the fourth stage, the clash with Israel.\nThis is the words of the enemy. The President of the United States and the Congress must listen carefully to what the enemy says in order to be able to protect you. It makes sense for us to take their words seriously if our most important job is the security of the United States. Mr. Zawahiri has laid out their plan. That's why they attacked us on September the 11th. That's why they fight us in Iraq today. And that is why they must be defeated. (Applause.)\nSome Democrats in Congress say that we should not be fighting the terrorists in Iraq; it was a mistake to go into Iraq in the first place. I believe these Democrats need to answer a simple question: Do they really believe that we would be better off if Saddam Hussein were still in power? In a recent interview, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee was asked this very question. And his answer was, yes, yes, and, yes.\nIf this is what the Democrats think, they need to make this case to the American people: They need to make the case that the world would be better off it Saddam Hussein were still in power. If Saddam Hussein were still in power, he would still be sponsoring terror and paying families of suicide bombers. If he were still in power, he would still be pursuing weapons of mass destruction. He would still be killing his own people. He would still be firing at our pilots. He would still be defying the United Nations. He would still be bilking the oil for food program and using one of the largest oil reserves in the world to threaten Western economies and to fuel his ambitions.\nAfter the attacks of September the 11th, it became clear that the United States of America must confront threats before they come and hurt us. Saddam Hussein's regime was a serious threat, a risk the world could not afford to take. America, Iraqis, and the world are safer because Saddam Hussein is not in power. (Applause.)\nIn a recent series of speeches, I made it clear that we're in the early hours of a long struggle for civilization. I have made it clear that we're in the ideological struggle of the 21st century. I've also made it clear that the safety of the American people depends on the outcome of the battle in the streets of Baghdad.\nI strongly believe that Iraq is a central front in the war on terror. The Democrats may not think so, but Osama bin Laden does. Here are the words of bin Laden, \"I now address... the whole... Islamic nation: Listen and understand... The most... serious issue today for the whole world is this Third World War... [that] is raging in [Iraq].\" He calls it \"a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam.\" He says, \"The whole world is watching this war,\" and that it will end in \"victory and glory or misery and humiliation.\"\nFor al Qaeda, Iraq is not a distraction from their war on America, it is a central battlefield where there's -- outcome of the struggle will be decided.\nThe NIE I quoted earlier says this about Iraq. It said, \"Perceived jihadist success there,\" in Iraq, \"would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere. It also says that \"Should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive themselves, and be perceived, to have failed, we judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight.\"\nDemocrats in Washington have been quoting the NIE a lot in recent days, but you don't hear them quoting that part of the document. The Democrats can't have it both ways. Either they believe that Iraq is a distraction from the war on terror or they agree with the intelligence community and the terrorists themselves that the outcome of Iraq is important in the war on terror. Truth is, the Democrats are using the NIE to mislead the American people and justify their policy of withdrawal from Iraq.\nThe American people need to know what withdrawal from Iraq would mean. By withdrawing from Iraq before the job is done, we would be doing exactly what the extremists and terrorists want.\nThe terrorists' entire strategy is based on the belief that America is weak and does not have the stomach for the long fight. Bin Laden has called American withdrawals from places like Beirut and Somalia as proof that if the terrorists are patient America will lose her nerve and withdraw in disgrace.\nThe greatest danger is not that America's presence in Iraq is drawing new recruits to the terrorist cause. The greatest danger is that an American withdrawal from Iraq would embolden the terrorists and help them find new recruits to carry out even more destructive attacks on the American homeland. And that is why the United States of America will stand with the brave Iraqis and defeat the terrorists in Iraq. (Applause.)\nThe stakes are high in this war. It's really important that the United States of America understands the nature of this enemy and understands what it would mean to leave Iraq before the job is done. If we were to abandon this young democracy to the extremists, imagine what other reformers and people of moderation would think about the United States of America. If we were to abandon our mission in Iraq where many have sacrificed, imagine what the enemy would think about the United States of America and our will.\nIf we were to abandon Iraq and create a vacuum in that country, and that country were then taken over by the extremists, make no mistake about it, they would have mighty assets to use in order to inflict economic pain on the United States of America. We're not going to let this happen. America is a nation that keeps its commitments to those who long for liberty and want to live in peace. America is a nation that will keep its commitment to make sure that you're secure. America is a nation that does not retreat in the face of thugs and assassins. (Applause.)\nWe're going to help the Iraqi people. Remember, 12 million of them voted in elections last December. That probably seems like a decade ago to you, but when the history is finally written, it will be just a comma. Twelve million people stood up in the face of assassins and car bombers and said, we want to be free.\nI'm not surprised. I was pleased. I'm not surprised because I believe in this principle, a principle which should be a guiding light of American foreign policy: There is an Almighty, and a gift of that Almighty to every man, woman and child on the face of the Earth is freedom. (Applause.) I believe deep in the soul of every person is the desire to live in liberty, and I know that liberty will yield the peace we want for generations to come.\nFrom the beginning of the struggle, I've made it clear that we will defend this country by giving people the tools needed, that we'll defend America by staying on the offense, that we will find the terrorists and bring them to justice so they can't hurt us here at home. But I've also made it clear that defeating the terrorists in the long run requires defeating their hateful ideology.\nThe NIE explicitly states, the National Intelligence Estimate, that I have been discussing and has been widely discussed in the newspapers states this, that the terrorists greatest vulnerability is that their ideology is \"unpopular with the vast majority of Muslims.\" People want to be free. People want to be able to express themselves freely. Mothers in the Muslim world share the same thing as mothers here, they want their children to grow up in a peaceful world.\nAnd that's why it's essential that the United States of America stand with moderates and reformers and peaceful people, millions of men and women in the Muslim world who want a normal life and a more hopeful future for their children and their grandchildren. And as this powerful majority gains control over the destiny -- over their destiny through the democratic progress, they will marginalize the radicals and extremists and their hateful vision of the world.\nThe transition from tyranny to democracy is tough work, but it's necessary work. It's the calling of history. It's the challenge to our generation to defend America and to lay the foundation of peace for generations to come. The extremists and the radicals will exploit these difficulties in every way they can. They will try to shake our will. They will use the murder of innocent men and women and children in order to convince America that the fight isn't worth it. Yet in the long run, America -- if we keep our faith in our principles -- will prevail.\nEncouraging the rise of free societies across the broader Middle East is the only way to overcome the threat of terrorism and to protect the American people in the long run. We owe it to a generation of children to come to do the hard work now. Imagine a Middle East where there's competing factions of extremism. Imagine a Middle East where the radicals control oil. Imagine a Middle East where there's an armed theocracy with a nuclear weapon. Fifty years from now, people will say, couldn't they see it; why couldn't they see the threat?\nNow is the time for the United States of America to lay the foundation of peace, to confront the challenges we have square on, to protect our country, to do our duty so that generations will look back and say, thank God this generation of Americans was willing to serve and serve strong. (Applause.)\nThe stakes in this war are high, and so are the stakes this November. Americans face the choice between two parties with two different attitudes on this war on terror. Five years after 9/11, the worst attack on American homeland in our history, the Democrats offer nothing but criticism and obstruction, and endless second-guessing. The party of FDR and the party of Harry Truman has become the party of cut-and-run. (Applause.)\nOur party's record is clear. We see the stakes. We understand the nature of the enemy. We know that the enemy wants to attack us again. We will not wait to respond to the enemy. We're not going to wait for them to attack us in order to respond. We will fight them wherever they make a stand. We will settle for nothing less than victory.\nThanks for coming. God bless. (Applause.)\nEND 2:15 P.M.

Bruce Westerman [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Westerman, Gohmert, Labrador, Radewagen, Bergman, Johnson, Bishop (ex officio), McEachin, Gallego, Huffman, Soto, and Grijalva (ex officio). Also Present: Representatives Lamborn, Gosar, Napolitano, Beyer, Torres, Barragan, Gomez, and Vela. Mr. Westerman. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will come to order. The Subcommittee is meeting today to hear testimony on the costs of denying Border Patrol access: our environment and security. I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Gosar; the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Lamborn; the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Napolitano; the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Beyer; the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Torres; the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Barragan; the gentleman from California, Mr. Gomez; and the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Vela, be allowed to sit with the Committee and participate in the hearing. Without objection, so ordered. Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at hearings are limited to the Chairman, the Ranking Minority Member, and the Vice Chair. This will allow us to hear from our witnesses sooner and help Members keep to their schedules. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that all other Members' opening statements be made part of the hearing record, if they are submitted to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5 p.m. today. Without objection, so ordered. STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS Mr. Westerman. Seventy-five pounds of marijuana, almost $8,000 of brown heroin, 5 illegal border crossers with unknown intentions, and 11 more illegals who got away. In the course of just one evening 2 weeks ago, that is what I witnessed along a small portion of the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector. Nationally, in the past few months alone, Border Patrol has already apprehended more than 100,000 border violators, seized over 200,000 pounds of marijuana, 113 pounds of heroin, and 196 pounds of the deadly opioid, fentanyl. These numbers do not even account for the seizures of drugs at ports of entries. And we should keep in mind that these statistics only represent what we have caught. Border Patrol uses estimates, so God only knows what we have really missed coming through our borders. We are dealing with professional drug and human traffickers who are organized, well-manned, and sophisticated. During an aerial tour on my visit to the border, we spotted scout locations hidden in the rocky mountain tops on the U.S. side of the border. These difficult to detect spots are used by criminals to monitor and communicate Border Patrol's every move on the ground to guide smugglers away from our agents. You see the display there. In one of these particular areas, you can see in the circle there, is actually a solar panel that was packed in that is used to charge cell phones and radios so that these scouts can communicate. [Slide.] You can see from these photos that these scouts are prepared to camp out for weeks or months. They have gotten so advanced that they have even set up these solar panels. Aside from the garbage that they leave behind, at least they are being environmentally conscious by using alternative energy sources. Border security is a complex and daunting issue that affects our lives and public safety. One thing, however, was abundantly clear on my trip with Chairman Bishop to the border. We need to ensure that we give our law enforcement agents appropriate access to the Federal lands they patrol to keep us safe. Take, for example, the Tucson Sector's 262 miles of border, 86 percent of which is on Federal or tribal lands. Of the approximate 1,900 miles on the southern border, about 35 percent is on Federal or tribal lands. With vast amounts of Federal land, accompanied by an array of environmental laws, our Border Patrol agents face statutory restraints in addition to the physical challenges and dangers of their jobs. Meanwhile, cross-border violators are not just comprised of families and children, they are also human traffickers, drug smugglers, and violent criminals. While our agents spend time seeking and waiting for authorization from Federal land managers to make sure environmental impacts are addressed, criminals trample through environmentally sensitive areas leaving tons of garbage and waste along their paths. On Federal borderlands, it can take months or even years for Border Patrol to receive approval to maintain roads or install tactical infrastructure, such as communications relays, video surveillance towers, and radars. After securing approval from Federal land managers, Border Patrol actions may be subject to the NEPA review process, causing further delays in operational deployment. Securing approval to build just a few miles of new roads on federally owned borderland, something agents we spoke to identified as particularly important in rugged, isolated terrain, can be a multiple-year process. These authorization requirements and permitting delays can have a crippling effect on border security. During our visit to the Arizona border, one agent explained to us the tremendous bureaucratic delays Border Patrol can face to remediate or fill illicit tunnels used for drug smuggling. In one instance, we were told about a known tunnel left unfilled for months because of the presence of a threatened or endangered species. This is unacceptable, and I can guarantee that the drug cartels using the tunnel did not care about the welfare of that species. Cartels and illegal immigrants don't wait for environmental assessments, they don't participate in Section 7 ESA consultations, and they don't follow Wilderness Act restrictions. High volumes of illegal border crossings do cause extensive environmental damage to our public lands by igniting costly wildfires, sometimes as diversionary tactics, and destroying species habitat. In addition, safety concerns related to illegal immigration, drug smuggling, and even the murder of a park ranger have forced national monuments, forests, and wildlife refuges on the border to close to the public for extended periods of time. Denying public access betrays our promise to present and future generations to use and enjoy these lands as intended. Cross-border violators take advantage of Border Patrol's lack of operational flexibility on Federal lands. We need to ensure that our environmental laws do not compromise Border Patrol's ability to detect, identify, track, and respond to cross-border violations. This hearing gives us the opportunity to hear from people who have grappled with the problems of illegal immigration and an unsecured border. I look forward to their testimony and to continuing this Committee's work toward a solution. [The prepared statement of Mr. Westerman follows:] Prepared Statement of the Hon.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA Mr. McEachin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to each of our witnesses for taking time and spending your own treasure to be with us here today. I also want to thank Ranking Member Grijalva for taking the time to join us and share his thoughts as someone who lives, and represents people who live, near the border. I am disappointed to see that, once again, no one from the Administration was invited to be a witness today. This Subcommittee is charged with conducting oversight over Federal policies in our jurisdiction. It is beyond me to understand how we can effectively do that if we continue to fail to invite the entity responsible for carrying them out. Nevertheless, I am pleased to have the opportunity to talk about environmental and public safety issues along the border. As has become a trademark of President Trump and congressional Republicans, some of my colleagues want to blame all of our problems on aspiring Americans. They will have you believe that immigrants are criminals and gang members who are not only dangerous, but now also apparently environmentally reckless. This rhetoric vilifies real human beings who, many times, are risking their lives to reunite with their families or escape violence from their countries. These are people seeking a better life, not seeking to break the law. When we finally stop blaming others, we can see that we have put laws and systems in place that endanger the economy, environment, and health of our border communities far more than the discarded trash of a border crosser. For those who are unaware, the Secretary of Homeland Security already has sole authority to waive all laws and legal requirements that potentially get in the way of building fences, walls, and roads along the border. That means that any law, including our bedrock environmental, public health, and safety laws, can be totally ignored when it comes to building a fence, or worse, the President's preposterous wall. If this sounds like an over-reach of power, that is because it is. In fact, it has been described as having greater reach than any other waiver authority in statute. Some legal experts have even deemed it unconstitutional. Despite the backlash and opposition to the waiver, however, the Secretary of Homeland Security has used it eight times, three of which were in the last 6 months of the Trump administration alone. Each time the Secretary has used the waiver, a whole slew of environmental and public safety laws have been tossed aside. The poster behind me names all 48 of the laws that have been waived. These laws are American rights. Rights to hold the government accountable. Rights to be protected from toxic waste and unsafe drinking water. Rights for tribes to protect their own burial grounds, to name a few. When these laws are recklessly ignored, the people and wildlife that live along the border suffer the most. Their health and safety are put at risk in the name of a fence. If that is not bad enough, Republicans have recently introduced a bill that would expand the waiver further. This bill would allow the Secretary to use the waiver for all infrastructure and technology, not just building fences and roads. This is unacceptable and, quite frankly, dangerous for the communities and public lands along our borders. Scapegoating the victims and building walls is simply not the solution to our border security issues. This Committee owes the American public a real conversation, not this sham. I yield back the remainder of my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. McEachin follows:] Prepared Statement of the Hon. A.

I yield back the remainder of my time. ______ Mr. Westerman. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the Vice Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Johnson from Louisiana, for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF THE HON. MIKE JOHNSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding this critical hearing to explore the challenges faced by Border Patrol agents on Federal borderlands, as well as for your trip with Chairman Bishop earlier this month to visit the U.S.-Mexico border so we could get an update on the latest status of the Nation's border security. Our government has placed the men and women who patrol our border, as well as the American citizens who live on or near the border, in a very difficult position. We all recognize that. As is all too often the case, Washington has created bureaucratic hurdles that have adversely impacted the Border Patrol agents' abilities to secure our southern border. While well intentioned, the Memorandum of Understanding that the Departments of Interior, Homeland Security, and Agriculture have entered into has created challenges and delayed Border Patrol agents' abilities to respond to illegal activity in Federal lands adjacent to the border. Nearly 35.3 percent of the southern border runs along or through federally owned lands. Understanding the regulatory difficulties posed to Border Patrol officers due to the Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and other policies, illegal immigrants, human traffickers, and drug smugglers have targeted Federal lands to conduct their illicit activities. Those illicit activities not only threaten the personal security of those who live along the border, but they have caused extensive ecological and environmental damage. Human waste, garbage, wildfires, tunnels, and the like have contributed to serious damage to wildlife habitats. In a July 2011 Department of the Interior report, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identified mass illegal immigration as a likely contributing factor in the 79 percent decline in the U.S. Sonoran pronghorn population between 2000 and 2002. This is at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, 79 percent, that is a massive impact to an endangered species that is found nowhere else in the world. Republican and Democrat administrations alike have highlighted the need to address this issue. For example, former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano wrote in a 2009 letter to our Chairman, Mr. Bishop, ``While the U.S. Border Patrol recognizes the importance and value of wilderness area designations, they can have a significant impact on U.S. Border Patrol operations in border regions. This includes that these types of restrictions can impact the efficacy of operations and be a hindrance to the maintenance of officer safety.'' Former Department of the Interior Secretary Salazar stated in 2010, ``We have seen that national security and environmental conservation are mutually supporting goals.'' It was with all of the above in mind that I introduced H.R. 3593, the Securing Our Borders and Wilderness Act, which provides a statutory fix to an issue perpetuated by bureaucracy that, as we have said, is endangering both border security and our Federal lands. The bill allows for the Department of Homeland Security to conduct border security activities on Federal lands in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, also protects wilderness areas. I look forward to highlighting how my bill will help to alleviate the impediments Border Patrol agents are facing at present, as well as the issues more broadly that we will be discussing today. I want to thank all of our witnesses for taking the time to speak to this Committee. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Johnson follows:] Prepared Statement of the Hon.

That is a massive impact to an endangered species that is found nowhere else in the world. Republican and Democrat administrations alike have highlighted the need to address this issue. For example, former DHS Secretary Napolitano wrote in a 2009 letter to Chairman Bishop, ``While the USBP recognizes the importance and value of wilderness area designations, they can have a significant impact on USBP operations in border regions.

I now recognize the Ranking Minority Member of the Full Committee, Mr. Grijalva of Arizona, for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF THE HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate the courtesy. The Ranking Member has outlined my point of view on this hearing very well. I can't do much better. But there is an irony today. We are at the dawn of another senseless mass murder, 17 students and 15 wounded, some critically, in Florida, by a shooter with a semiautomatic AR-15. No doubt the House will pause today, and we should, to give our condolences and prayers to the victims and the families. Then there will be a lot of talk about mental health, and then we are going to ask people to be more vigilant, but nothing else. No legislative efforts to reduce gun violence. No prohibition of bump stocks. No universal background checks. Nothing. NRA will keep that from happening. They will talk about the sanctity of the Second Amendment and people's individual rights, and that will take precedent over reducing gun violence, that doesn't take the right from Americans to own and have guns. But, on the contrary, the Majority of this Committee has-- wherever that legislation is to allow silencers on public land, to allow armor-piercing ammunition, to allow lead contamination once again to kill wildlife. And then today, we are discussing another set of rights. And the agenda that the Department of Homeland Security wants to have ultimate power to waive laws, ignore the public's right to know, and within the 100-mile zone, to ignore and handcuff due process and basic rights and constitutional guarantees that all Americans have. I mention that because the question today is simply, does Homeland Security and Border Patrol need more power beyond the unprecedented authority that the Ranking Member outlined since 2005 on our public lands, and within that 100-mile area, the authority that already exists relative to search and seizure, probable cause, that are handcuffed in that area? And we are asking about a unilateral authority to an agency with no review, no accountability, and no responsibility for any negative consequences. Besides the constriction of--this is all a tactical response, Mr. Chairman, a response in enforcement only justified by some level of political hysteria. Things like the mass invasion of MS-13 pouring over the border. Not true. The gateway in my district of drug smuggling and poisoning of America. That was a tweet that came from the Majority Committee, which described that part of my district. It was cute, but it was a lie. And I can swear to you, Mr. Chairman, nowhere in my district is there a large pharmaceutical plant like Pfizer pumping out Oxy or other opioid-based drugs that have savaged America and made a huge profit for them, and continue to be overprescribed. To attack drug and human smuggling, those cartels and organized crimes need a strategic, focused, consistent, law enforcement response, not a pointless $25 billion wall, 10,000 more private for-profit beds, waiving environmental laws, handcuffing basic individual and constitutional rights, and, fundamentally, Mr. Chairman, creating a distinct second class America in that part of the borderlands, that 100 miles of the southwest. This hearing comes at a time when we are engulfed in a debate about DACA, engulfed in a debate about what will happen with border security. This is not a time for exaggeration, untruths, generalizations, scare tactics that won't solve anything. And nor does the position that DHS has just taken to oppose any reasonable bipartisan Senate compromise on DACA, that shouldn't be the guide. They only endorse the most extreme pieces of legislation that have come out. No bipartisan, no compromise legislation will they tolerate. I think what we are doing here today is handing over to an agency extrajudicial power. We are handing over to an agency a police function, turned into much more than that. The border region should not be under martial law, it should not feel like an occupied part of America, and should not be treated different than any other place. People in Utah, Montana, and Wyoming would not appreciate what is going on in the borderlands. I thank you for the witnesses today, and yield back. [The prepared statement of Mr. Grijalva follows:] Prepared Statement of the Hon. Raul M. Grijalva, a Representative in Congress from the State of Arizona The question for today is whether the Border Patrol needs even more power. What do they have now? The REAL ID Act of 2005 gave the Department of Homeland Security authority to waive ``all legal requirements'' that might impede the construction of barriers and roads. Think about that for a second. All legal requirements. On any land, public or private. That includes any Federal law that gives you and me the right to basic things like clean water, clean air, the right to participate in government decisions, and the right for native Americans to maintain their sacred burial grounds. It also includes any state and local law that might get in the way. The Congressional Research Service called the authority ``unprecedented.'' That waiver authority has had consequences for nearby communities. It has produced flooding, erosion, death of animals that endangered or threatened, and loss of economic opportunities like ecotourism in low income communities, for starters. As anti-democratic, unprecedented and harmful as that waiver authority is, it is not enough for the Majority. They want to expand it with authority they call ``waiving certain Federal environmental laws.'' Let me translate that for you. They want to waive ``all legal requirements'' when the Border Patrol is working not just on walls and roads, but also tactical infrastructure and technology which applies to a much larger swath of Border Patrol activity. They also want to remove the requirement that the American people are notified when the waiver authority is used on Federal lands. That effectively allows individual Border Patrol agents to decide on the spot whether to waive any legal requirements on Federal lands within 100 miles of the border. Aside from the occasional anecdote, hear-say, and outdated reports, there is no evidence that access to Federal lands is a problem. An existing Memorandum of Understanding already facilitates the Border Patrol and Federal land management agencies to work smoothly together on accessing Federal lands, according to past testimony from the Border Patrol. It's not clear to me why, of all the crimes committed in the United States, unapproved entry into the country is the only one to merit a waiver-fueled police state in the eyes of the Majority. Given the Majority's recent letter in defense of the rights of the Bundys, it is clear that even repeated domestic terrorism doesn't rise to that level. The creeping militarization of our border has done little to slow border crossings. But it has affected our border communities. I should know. I have border communities in my district. If the Chairmen of this Full Committee and Subcommittee had told me they were taking a Committee-funded trip to my district and surrounding area, I could have shown them the non-border patrol view of border communities. They would have found local economies that rely on cross-border commerce. They would have seen a desert landscape arbitrarily split by a wall, blocking local wildlife from their natural migration patterns, and scarring the ecology of the entire region. And they would have heard from the people who call this region home about what it means to have to surrender their basic rights to the Border Patrol. Instead, they saw what they wanted to see. Chairman Bishop went so far as to tweet to me directly that my ``district has become the gateway for cartels to smuggle dangerous drugs into the United States and poison American communities.'' That view of our border communities, and my district, is based on some very old and very dangerous stereotypes and it is just not true. But those are the kinds of views motivating this campaign to destroy the quality of life in border communities with this wall. Does the Border Patrol need even more power than the unprecedented power they already have? The clear answer is no. ______ Mr. Westerman. The gentleman's time has expired. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today, and I will now take a moment to give a brief introduction of our witnesses. Mr. Andrew Arthur is a Resident Fellow in Law and Policy at the Center for Immigration Studies and a former immigration judge; Mr. Dan Bell is President of the ZZ Cattle Corporation; Mr. Scott Nicol is the volunteer Co-Chair of the Sierra Club Borderlands Campaign; and Mr. Brandon Judd is President of the National Border Patrol Council. Let me remind the witnesses that under our Committee Rules, you must limit your oral statements to 5 minutes, but your entire statement will appear in the hearing record. Our microphones are not automatic. When you start your testimony, please push the button, it will turn green. After 4 minutes, the yellow light will appear on the timer. And when the red light comes on, I will ask that you please complete your statement. I will also allow the entire panel to testify before questioning the witnesses. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Arthur to testify for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE ANDREW R. ARTHUR, RESIDENT FELLOW IN LAW AND POLICY, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Arthur. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member McEachin, and members of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I appreciate you inviting me here today to discuss these important issues. Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to experience the natural beauty of our national parks. Recently, however, I have had the misfortune of seeing the degradation caused by illegal cross-border traffic. Paths worn through natural landscapes and abandoned rafts, garbage, and human waste were all evidence of illegal entry. While cross-border traffic has declined in my 25 years in the field of immigration, the numbers are still staggering. In Fiscal Year 2017, Border Patrol apprehended 303,916 individuals along the southwest border. Not all of this traffic consisted of aliens coming to the United States for work. Last year, for example, Border Patrol seized 9,346 pounds of cocaine, 953 pounds of heroin, 10,328 pounds of methamphetamines, and 181 pounds of fentanyl. On my calculations, this is enough fentanyl alone to kill 36 million Americans. In the last fiscal year, Border Patrol agents apprehended 8,531 criminal aliens. They also arrested 228 aliens associated with MS-13, a gang so organized and dangerous that in 2012 the Obama Treasury Department designated them a transnational criminal organization. As my written testimony reveals, suspected terrorists are also believed to have attempted illegal entry along our southern border. Border Patrol agents must confront well- organized, well-funded, and extremely violent operatives in their attempts to secure the southwest border. Transnational criminal organizations like the Gulf Cartel, Los Zetas, and the Sinaloa Cartel, founded by the notorious Joaquin ``El Chapo'' Guzman, control territory and smuggling routes along the border, and profit from the illegal cross- border traffic of aliens, drugs, and other contraband. The drugs that they deliver flow into every corner of our country, ruining lives, destroying families, and undermining our communities and our way of life. But the consequences are worse for Mexico. In fact, last year was that country's most violent on record. Because of these groups, corruption there is rampant and civil society reels. And as the Mexican Government has targeted these groups, the situation has gotten worse because rival cliques war over smuggling routes and territory, with innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. But you don't need to believe me about the violent nature of these criminals. Last week's Wall Street Journal quoted an opponent of the President's wall proposal whose family owns land near the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge in Alamo, Texas. She is concerned the wall would divide her property, resulting in, ``drug smugglers attacking farmworkers in hopes of getting the code needed to open an access gate.'' She understands the danger. However, our agents have been hamstrung in responding to these threats. As you know, Border Patrol must obtain permission from Federal land management agencies before its agents can maintain roads and install critical infrastructure such as surveillance equipment when operating on Federal lands. The agency's access to portions of those lands along the southwest border has also been limited by land management laws. Given the threat that illegal cross-border traffickers pose to our communities and our national security, and the well- funded and organized nature of the organizations that profit from that traffic, this is unacceptable. We all agree that protecting the American people must be the first duty of government. Border Patrol must be able to move freely across Federal lands when necessary and have unconstrained access to a tactical infrastructure and maintain needed access roads. This will not only make our country safer and more secure, it will also prevent the environmental degradation caused by such traffic and protect the land management employees who work to preserve that land. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Arthur follows:] Prepared Statement of Andrew R. Arthur, Resident Fellow in Law and Policy, Center for Immigration Studies Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member McEachin, and Members of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I want to thank you for inviting me here today to discuss this important issue. my background For more than 24 years, I served in various roles in the Federal Government in the field of immigration. I began as a law clerk in the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the agency in the Department of Justice (DOJ) with jurisdiction over removal proceedings and adjudications relating to sections 274A (employer sanctions), 274B (unfair immigration-related employment practices, and 274C (civil document fraud) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ About the Office, United States Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review, available at: https:// www.justice.gov/eoir/about-office. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- From there, I started as a trial attorney at the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), working my way up to Associate General Counsel. For a period of time, I served as the Acting Chief of the National Security Law Division (NSLD), the unit within the INS General Counsel's Office with jurisdiction over terrorists, espionage risks, and persecutors. During my term at the INS, the agency had jurisdiction over the Border Patrol, then and now the Federal Government component with primary jurisdiction for enforcing the immigration laws of the United States between the ports of entry.\\2\\ As Associate General Counsel in the INS Enforcement Division, and later in the NSLD, I regularly handled issues relating to border security, and the need for barriers along the southwest border. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Legal authority for the Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, available at: https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/ 1084//legal-authority-for-the-border-patrol. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I left the INS 6 weeks before September 11, 2001, because I was concerned about vulnerabilities in our immigration enforcement system that could be exploited by aliens who posed a risk to our national security. Believing that those vulnerabilities could only properly be addressed by Congress, I took a position as Oversight Counsel for Immigration at the House Judiciary Committee. I was in this position when the Committee, responding to the attacks of September 11, drafted the ``Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism,'' or USA PATRIOT Act.\\3\\ In addition, I played a role in the drafting of the Homeland Security Act of 2002,\\4\\ which established the Department of Homeland Security in more or less its present form. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism, Pub.

L. 107-296 (2002), available at: https://www.Congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/ 5005. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I later transitioned to the position of legislative counsel for the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims. Most importantly for purposes of today's hearing, it was in this position that I served as one of the primary staff drafters of the REAL ID Act of 2005,\\5\\ which I will discuss further below. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109-13, div. B (2005), available at: https://www.Congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/1268. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I left Congress to take the bench as an Immigration Judge at the York Immigration Court in York, Pennsylvania, where I served for more than 8 years. At the beginning of my service in this position, the vast majority of aliens who appeared before me had been apprehended in the interior of the United States. During my last 3 years on the bench, however, I began to see more and more aliens who have been apprehended after entering the United States illegally along the southwest border and claiming credible fear.\\6\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ See Andrew R. Arthur, Fraud in the ``Credible Fear'' Process, Threats to the Integrity of the Asylum System, Center for Immigration Studies (Apr. 19, 2017), available at: https://www.cis.org/Report/ Fraud-Credible-Fear-Process. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In January 2015, I left the bench to serve as the Staff Director at the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's National Security Subcommittee, a position that I held until September 2016. In this role, I had oversight jurisdiction of the activities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), among other agencies. Since April 2017, I have worked as the Resident Fellow in Law and Policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research organization here in Washington, DC. In this role, I toured the border in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV), between McAllen and Roma, Texas, with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Border Patrol, as well as the border in and near Del Rio, Texas with the Val Verde County Sheriff in August 2017. border security As I noted above, the Border Patrol is responsible for securing the border between the ports of entry. As CBP describes Border Patrol's enforcement efforts, the agency: [U]se[s] a layered approach that includes patrolling the border itself, (including the use of electronic surveillance devices), patrolling nearby areas and neighborhoods where illegal immigrants can quickly fade into the general population, and conducting checkpoints--both stationary and temporary.\\7\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ Legal authority for the Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, available at: https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/ 1084//legal-authority-for-the-border-patrol. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has described the --------------------------------------------------------------------------- foundations of this border-control strategy: Since the 1990s, migration control at the border has been guided by a strategy of ``prevention through deterrence''--the idea that the concentration of personnel, infrastructure, and surveillance technology along heavily trafficked regions of the border will discourage unauthorized migrants from attempting to enter the United States. Since 2005, CBP has attempted to discourage repeat unauthorized migrant entries and disrupt migrant smuggling networks by imposing tougher penalties against certain unauthorized migrants, a set of policies eventually described as ``enforcement with consequences.'' Most people apprehended at the southwest border are now subject to ``high consequence'' enforcement outcomes.\\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Carla N. Argueta, Border Security: Immigration Enforcement Between Ports of Entry (R42138), Cong Research Serv. (Apr. 19, 2016), available at: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R42138.pdf.

This authority allows Border Patrol agents to apprehend and charge smugglers of drugs and other contraband into the United States. the role of fencing and tactical infrastructure in border enforcement Fencing and tactical infrastructure plays a significant, but often misunderstood, role in the Border Patrol's enforcement strategy. CRS has detailed various forms of tactical infrastructure along the border: Border tactical infrastructure includes roads, lighting, pedestrian fencing, and vehicle barriers. Tactical infrastructure is intended to impede illicit cross-border activity, disrupt and restrict smuggling operations, and establish a substantial probability of apprehending terrorists seeking entry into the United States.\\21\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ Carla N. Argueta, Border Security: Immigration Enforcement Between Ports of Entry (R42138), Cong Research Serv. (Apr. 19, 2016), at 14, available at: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R42138.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Internal footnote omitted). Put in layman's terms, pedestrian fencing, roads, lighting, sensors, and vehicle barriers each play two different, but complementary, roles in border enforcement: First, they serve as a deterrent to attempted entry. For example, pedestrian fencing increases the difficulty and cost of such entry, and by eliminating easy access across the border, reduces the likelihood of attempted entry. Illegal entrants and smugglers follow the same rules of incentives and economics that most actors follow, and amend their actions accordingly. Similarly, lighting inhibits the ability of those caught crossing the border illegally to do so under cover of darkness, making it more likely that they will be caught, and less likely that they will be enter the United States to, for example, work. Second, such infrastructure creates an impediment to illicit crossing. Even if an individual attempts illegal entry by going around barriers or over fencing, those impediments will slow entry, providing Border Patrol more time to deploy agents to the incursion point. In the same way, sensors and cameras notify Border Patrol about illegal entries, again facilitating timely deployment. This enables CBP to direct its limited resources effectively and efficiently to those areas where active incursions are occurring. And, by any measure, those resources are limited. As of February 2017, CBP had fewer than 20,000 Border Patrol Agents,\\22\\ below its authorization of 21,000. While this number might seem high, the U.S.- Mexican border is approximately 1,933 miles long, and the U.S.-Canadian border spans some 3,987 miles, not including the Canadian border with Alaska.\\23\\ Tactical infrastructure is therefore critical to the Border Patrol's mission. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ Brian Naylor, Trump's Plan To Hire 15,000 Border Patrol And ICE Agents Won't Be Easy, NPR (Feb. 23, 2017), available at: https:// www.npr.org/2017/02/23/516712980/trumps-plan-to-hire-15-000-border- patrol-and-ice-agents-wont-be-easy-to-fulfill. \\23\\ Janice Cheryl Beaver, U.S. International Borders: Brief Facts, Cong.

At the time that I, as a staffer on the House Judiciary Committee, was reviewing the INA for potential national security vulnerabilities in the 109th Congress, section 102(a) of IIRIRA directed the Attorney General to ``to install additional physical barriers and roads (including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.'' \\32\\ Section 102(c) of that act waived ``provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 . . . to the extent the Attorney General determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section.'' \\33\\ Section 102(d) gave the Attorney General the authority to acquire land ``essential to control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against any violation of'' the INA, including through condemnation.\\34\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\32\\ Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), P.L. 104-208, div.

It provides for a waiver of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) to the extent the Attorney General determines is necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads. Despite the existing waiver provision, construction of the San Diego area barriers has been delayed due to a dispute involving other laws. The California Coastal Commission has prevented completion of the San Diego border security infrastructure because it alleges that plans to complete it are inconsistent with the California Coastal Management Program, a state program approved pursuant to the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA)--notwithstanding the fact that the San Diego border security infrastructure was designed to avoid and/or minimize adverse environmental impacts, and the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security testified before the California Coastal Commission that the plans for completion were consistent with the Coastal Management Program to the maximum extent practicable without sacrificing the effectiveness of the border security infrastructure. Continued delays caused by litigation have demonstrated the need for additional waiver authority with respect to other laws that might impede the expeditious construction of security infrastructure along the border, such as the Coastal Zone Management Act. Current Law. Section 102(c) of IIRIRA provided for a waiver of the ESA and NEPA to the extent the Attorney General determines is necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads. Section 102 of the conference report would amend the current provision to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive all laws that he or she determines, in his or her sole discretion, are necessary to ensure the expeditious construction of the border barriers. Additionally, it would prohibit judicial review of a waiver decision or action by the Secretary and bar judicially ordered compensatory, declaratory, or injunctive, equitable, or any other relief or other remedy for damage alleged to result from any such decision or action. As discussed above, current statutes and the Reorganization Plan for the Department of Homeland Security have not amended and clarified references to executive authority throughout the INA. Accordingly, the provision would have replaced the reference in current law to the Attorney General by a reference to the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Conferees have revised the House provision in the following respects. First, the revised provision authorizes but does not require the Secretary of DHS to waive any legal requirements that he or she, in his or her sole discretion, determines are necessary to ensure expeditious construction of border security infrastructure. Second, the provision clarifies the intent of the conference report by substituting a reference to waiver of ``all legal requirements'' for the prior reference to waiver of ``all laws'', clarifying Congress' intent that the Secretary's discretionary waiver authority extends to any local, state or federal statute, regulation, or administrative order that could impede expeditious construction of border security infrastructure. Third, the conferees provided that any such waiver would become effective upon publication in the Federal Register, thereby ensuring appropriate public notice of such determinations. Finally, the Conferees have provided federal judicial review for claims alleging that the actions or decisions of the Secretary violate the United States Constitution. The Conferees have further provided that such claims must be filed within sixty days of the Secretary's action or decision, and that interlocutory or final judgments, decrees, or orders of federal district courts on such claims may be reviewed only upon petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Conferees' intent is to ensure that judicial review of actions or decisions of the Secretary not delay the expeditious construction of border security infrastructure, thereby defeating the purpose of the Secretary's waiver.\\36\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\36\\ H.R.

Notwithstanding the caveats in those two subclauses, or the fact that the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, left the waiver authority in section 102(c) of IIRIRA as amended by section 102 of the REAL ID Act in place, a plaintiff could easily assert that this consultation provision requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to alter or abandon a fencing project based on environmental impacts identified by ``the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, States, local governments, Indian tribes, and property owners.'' Clear waiver authority is necessary to overcome such assertions, and ensure that the Secretary of Homeland Security is able to erect barriers to protect against, and/or mitigate the effect of, cross-border incursions. dangers posed by illegal cross-border incursions The enforcement mission of the Border Patrol is vital to protecting our national security and the safety and health of the American people. According to the latest statistics from CBP,\\41\\ in FY 2017, 303,916 aliens were apprehended between the ports of entry along the southwest border, which was down from 408,870 in FY 2016 (but which itself was up from FY 2015, when 331,333 apprehensions occurred).

In October 2012, the Department of Treasury designated MS-13 as a ``transnational criminal organization'' (TCO).\\48\\ At that time, Treasury explained: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\48\\ Treasury Sanctions Latin American Criminal Organization, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury (Oct. 11, 2012), available at: https:// www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1733.aspx. MS-13 consists of at least 30,000 members in a range of countries, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, and is one of the most dangerous and rapidly expanding criminal gangs in the world today. MS-13 is active within the United States, with at least 8,000 members operating in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia. MS-13's criminal nature can be seen in one of its mottos, ``Mata, roba, viola, controla'' (``Kill, steal, rape, control''). Domestically, the group is involved in multiple crimes including murder, racketeering, drug trafficking, sex trafficking and human trafficking including prostitution. The group frequently carries out violent attacks on opposing gang members, often injuring innocent bystanders. MS-13 members have been --------------------------------------------------------------------------- responsible for numerous killings within the United States. Local MS-13 cliques take direction from the group's foreign leadership for strategic decisions involving moves into new territories and efforts to recruit new members. Money generated by local MS-13 cliques in the United States is consolidated and funneled to the group's leadership in El Salvador.\\49\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\49\\ Id. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in prepared remarks \\50\\ on April 18, 2017, described how the gang has exploited loopholes in the U.S. immigration system, and how it operates in the United States today: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\50\\ Remarks by Attorney General Jeff Sessions at Meeting of the Attorney General's Organized Crime Council and OCDETF Executive Committee, U.S. Dep't of Justice (April 18, 2017), available at: https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/remarks-attorney-general-jeff- sessions-meeting-attorney-general-s-organized-crime-council. Because of an open border and years of lax immigration enforcement, MS-13 has been sending both recruiters and members to regenerate gangs that previously had been decimated, and smuggling members across the border as unaccompanied minors. They are not content to simply ruin the lives of adults--MS-13 recruits in our high schools, our middle schools and even our --------------------------------------------------------------------------- elementary schools. Just a few days ago, law enforcement believes that members of MS-13 murdered four young men and dumped their bodies in a park on Long Island. Last month, it was two teenage girls [in] Brentwood, New York who were killed with machetes and baseball bats. A few weeks ago, the FBI added an MS-13 member to their Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List for a suspected brutal murder with a baseball bat and screwdriver--all purportedly to earn his MS-13 tattoo. Violence is an initiation rite. They've killed mothers alongside their children and vice versa. They have gang raped and trafficked girls as young as 12 years old. Plainly, stopping these criminals from entering the United States is a law-enforcement priority, one that is critical to protecting the public and the many communities in which the gang operates. Individuals with ties to terrorism have also attempted to enter the United States across the U.S.-Mexico border, as the Christian Science Monitor reported in January 2017.\\51\\ Most of the individuals identified in that article were apprehended after they attempted to enter illegally through the ports of entry. One case that bears particular notice as it pertains to illegal incursions, however, involves Anthony Joseph Tracy. As the paper reported: \\52\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\51\\ Warren Richey, Are terrorists crossing the U.S.-Mexico border?

Noor Services was a travel business in Nairobi, Kenya, that offered a very specific kind of assistance to its clients. The company specialized in helping would-be travelers from Somalia --------------------------------------------------------------------------- obtain visas to Cuba. They weren't making the trip to the Caribbean island to enjoy the hospitality of Havana, its food and music, or the nearby beaches. Instead, according to federal prosecutors, Cuba was seen as a doorway to the U.S.-Mexico border and an illicit crossing into America. The business was set up by Anthony Joseph Tracy, a U.S. citizen and Muslim convert, who told federal agents that he had helped 272 Somalis travel illegally to the U.S., according to court documents. Federal prosecutors were concerned about more than just illegal immigration. During a polygraph examination, Tracy admitted to investigators that he'd been approached by members of the Somali terror group Al Shabab.\\53\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\53\\ Who are Somalia's al-Shabab?, BBC News (Dec. 22, 2017), available at: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-15336689. He passed that portion of the polygraph. But he failed the part when asked whether he helped members of the terror group travel --------------------------------------------------------------------------- to the U.S., according to court documents. A prosecutor complained to the judge in Tracy's case that investigators had ``no idea who these individuals are that he assisted.'' She suggested Tracy's clients might pose a risk to national security. Tracy pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiring to induce non-citizens to enter the U.S. without legal authorization. Under the conspiracy outlined in court, Tracy helped his clients produce fraudulent documents to support their visa applications. He also paid bribes to a clerk at the Cuban Embassy in Kenya who issued the visas. Clients flew from Kenya to Dubai to Moscow to Cuba. From there they would fly to Belize and then travel to Mexico to make their way across the U.S. border. During a search, investigators found an email from a prospective client asking for Tracy's help, according to court documents. Tracy sent a reply that reads in part: ``I helped a lot of Somalis and most are good but there are some who are bad and I leave them to ALLAH . . ..'' Tracy told investigators he'd made about $90,000 during his nine months in business. Another intriguing reference in that article \\54\\ pertains to Adnan El Shukrijumah: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\54\\ Id. After Al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Adnan El Shukrijumah spent more than a decade at the top of the FBI's most wanted list. The U.S. Government offered a $5 million reward for information leading --------------------------------------------------------------------------- to his capture. He was believed to have been hand-picked by Osama Bin Laden and 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to plan and launch follow-up attacks against the U.S. and other Western countries. Federal agents were determined to find him before he could carry out a mass-casualty operation. Mr. Shukrijumah, a green-card holder from Saudi Arabia who had lived for many years in Brooklyn and south Florida, disappeared shortly before the 9/11 attacks. According to the Christian Science Monitor,\\55\\ a formerly classified document revealed that in 2004, ``officials at the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez received a tip about `suspect Arab extremists who have been smuggled through Mexico to the United States/ Mexico border.' '' Those ``extremists'' were purportedly in hiding in Agua Prieta, Sonora, Mexico, which is adjacent to Douglas, Arizona.\\56\\ The paper reports \\57\\ that the aforementioned document stated that ``one of the three men is `likely Adnan G.

Even before 9/11, . . . human smuggling networks were regularly transporting migrants--and potentially, terrorists among them-- from some 35-40 Islamic ``countries of special interest'' in the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa. The asylum- seeking people they moved would come to be known as ``Other than Mexicans, (OTMs)'' and then, even more specifically as American strategy developed around them, the OTM subcategory ``special interest aliens (SIAs).'' \\59\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\59\\ Id. It is beyond cavil that the Border Patrol's mission of disrupting the cross-border transit of aliens, terrorists, drugs, and other contraband plays an essential role in keeping the American people safe. Unfortunately, in performing that mission, the Border Patrol faces well-organized, violent, and sophisticated foes. criminal smuggling organizations Drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), other TCOs, and various subsidiary groups are actively involved in illicit cross-border traffic. With respect to alien smuggling, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reported: ``Moving human beings as cargo pays in the billions of dollars for transnational criminal smuggling organizations.'' \\60\\ ICE continues: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\60\\ Human smuggling equals grave danger, big money, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (updated Jan. 16, 2018), available at: https://www.ice.gov/features/human-smuggling-danger. Human smuggling operates as a contract business; an understanding exists among transnational criminal organizations, smugglers and individuals seeking transport that trying to cross the border independently is not an option. Smugglers escort the illegal aliens through the desert, across the border, to stash houses and onto their final destinations within the interior of the U.S. A portion of the smuggling fees paid to the transnational criminal organizations helps fuel their other criminal enterprises.\\61\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\61\\ Id. These groups have caused tremendous damage in Mexico, both in terms of human life and societal disruption. As CNN explained in December 2017: \\62\\ ``The Mexican government has been fighting a war with drug traffickers since December 2006.

There are more than a dozen gangs fighting in Acapulco, which is now Mexico's homicide capital. Up in the Tierra Caliente, a region that encompasses parts of northern Guerrero and neighboring [Michoacan] state, gangs have been battling for control of poppy production.

Those two cartels, as well as rivals with designs on controlling the territory, have been responsible for much of the violence in Tamaulipas over the last 20 years.

According to the Baja California State Secretariat for Public Security, the state experienced an increase in homicide rates compared to the same period in 2016.

Police corruption has been so extensive that law enforcement officials corrupted or infiltrated by the DTOs and other criminal groups sometimes carry out their violent assignments. Purges of Mexico's municipal, state, and federal police have --------------------------------------------------------------------------- not contained the problem. The relationship of Mexico's drug traffickers to the government and to one another is now a rapidly evolving picture, and any current snapshot (such as the one provided in this report) must be continually adjusted.\\91\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\91\\ Id. at 7. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, that report notes: An[] emerging factor has been the criminal diversification of the DTOs into poly crime organizations. In addition to trafficking illegal narcotics, they have branched into other profitable crimes, such as kidnapping, assassination for hire, auto theft, controlling prostitution, extortion, money- laundering, software piracy, resource theft, and human smuggling. The surge in violence due to inter- and intra-cartel conflict over lucrative drug smuggling routes has been accompanied by an increase in kidnapping for ransom and other crimes.\\92\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\92\\ Id. at 25. In short, the Border Patrol must respond to the efforts of violent, well-financed, ever-evolving criminal organizations on a daily basis in performing its mission. Given these facts, ``border security'' cannot easily be separated from ``domestic security,'' ``homeland security,'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- or ``national security.'' carrizo cane eradication Not all of the challenges that Border Patrol faces in performing its duties are the work of man, however. Along the Rio Grande River in the RGV and in the populated sections of Del Rio, Texas, I saw the impact of carrizo cane on the agency's ability to prevent cross-border incursions. As the Texas State The Soil & Water Conservation Board (S&WCB) website \\93\\ describes the problem: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\93\\ Rio Grande Carrizo Cane Eradication Program, Texas State The Soil & Water Conservation Board (undated), available at: https:// www.tsswcb.texas.gov/programs/rio-grande-carrizo-cane-eradication- program. Large dense stands of non-native carrizo cane (Arundo donax) now occupy the banks and floodplains of the Rio Grande, thwarting law enforcement efforts along the international border, impeding and concealing the detection of criminal activity, restricting law enforcement officers' access to riverbanks, and impairing the ecological function and --------------------------------------------------------------------------- biodiversity of the Rio Grande. Arundo is an exceptionally fast growing plant, able to grow about 4 inches per day and reach a mature height of over 25 feet in about 12 months. These stands of invasive riparian weeds present considerable obstacles for the protection of the international border by law enforcement and agricultural inspectors, by both significantly reducing visibility within enforcement areas and by providing favorable habitat for agriculturally damaging cattle ticks. Carrizo cane is considered one of the greatest threats to the health of riparian ecosystems in the southwestern United States, with great negative impact to biodiversity and ecological processes. Arundo does not provide any food sources or nesting habitats for native wildlife. Carrizo cane is linked to sediment accumulation, channel constriction, and increased flooding frequency threatening the riparian ecosystem of the Rio Grande. Carrizo cane is a noxious brush species that consumes precious water resources to a degree that is detrimental to water conservation. As a result of this weed's high evapotranspiration capacity, infestations threaten water supplies for agriculture and municipal drinking water uses in south Texas. Because of the thickness of the cane, and its height, those crossing the border illegally along the river are able to quickly enter stands of the plant, and remain or proceed undetected. During my August trip to the border, I saw numerous paths through the cane that had been worn by illegal entrants, a number of which were marked by the presence of deflated rafts that crossers had used to ford the river: [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] While Texas law \\94\\ requires SWCB to ``develop and implement a program to eradicate Carrizo cane along the Rio Grande River,'' the Texas Tribune reported in 2016: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\94\\ Tex. Agric. Code Sec. 201.0225 (2018), available at: http:// codes.findlaw.com/tx/agriculture-code/agric-sect-201-0225.html. [F]earing that herbicides used for the project will pollute the river, the primary water source for several border communities, an environmental group is planning a full-fledged effort to halt the plan and is recruiting local governments to join its side.\\95\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\95\\ Julian Aguilar, New Effort to Wipe Out Carrizo Cane Reignites Environmental Debate, Texas Tribune (Apr. 5, 2016), available at: https://www.texastribune.org/2016/04/05/new-carrizo-eradication-effort- reignites-old-debat/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The results of that effort are not clear. Eradicating this invasive plant would significantly facilitate control of the border in the areas where it proliferates, according to both Federal and state law-enforcement officials to whom I spoke. That plant also presents an officer-safety issue, as it conceals the presence of often-dangerous (and armed) smugglers and traffickers. border security on federal lands The interplay between the Border Patrol and other Federal agencies (with primarily environmental missions) is a significant issue because there are large numbers of Federal lands within close proximity to the southwest border that are managed by those other agencies.\\96\\ CRS, for example, has reported: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\96\\ See Carol Hardy Vincent, Laura A. Hanson, and Carla N. Argueta, Federal Land Ownership: Overview and Data (R42346), Cong. Research Serv. (Mar. 3, 2017), at 24, available at: https://fas.org/ sgp/crs/misc/R42346.pdf. Precise estimates of the acreage [within 50 and 100 miles from the U.S.-Mexican border] are not readily available because the agencies do not distinguish their lands by distance from the border. One estimate provided by the agencies to the House Committee on Natural Resources reported that within 100 miles of the border, there were about 26.7 million acres of federal lands. Nearly half of this land (12.3 million acres) was managed by [the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)], and the other federal lands were managed by [the Department of Defense (DOD)] (5.8 million acres), [Forest Service (FS)] (3.8 million acres), [National Park Service (NPS)] (2.4 million acres), [Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)] (2.2 million acres), and other federal agencies (0.2 million acres).\\97\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\97\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Footnote omitted). As CRS notes, while Border Patrol ``is the lead agency for border security between ports of entry,'' at least 40 percent ``of the southwestern border abuts Federal and tribal lands overseen by the FS and four [Department of the Interior (DOI)] agencies (including the Bureau of Indian Affairs) that also have law enforcement responsibilities.'' \\98\\ It admits: ``Differences in missions and jurisdictional complexity among these agencies have been identified as potentially hindering border control.'' \\99\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\98\\ Id. \\99\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- It reported: To facilitate control efforts, the three departments--DHS, the Department of Agriculture (for the FS), and DOI--signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) on border security. These MOUs govern information sharing, budgeting, and operational planning; [Border Patrol] access to federal lands; and interoperable radio communications, among other topics.\\100\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\100\\ Id. The tension among these agencies in executing their individual missions on Federal lands was the subject of an October 2010 report \\101\\ issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In that report, GAO explained: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\101\\ Southwest Border: More Timely Border Patrol Access and Training Could Improve Security Operations and Natural Resource Protection on Federal Lands (GAO-11-38), Gov't Accountability Office (Oct. 19, 2010), available at: https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-38. When operating on federal lands, Border Patrol has responsibilities under several federal land management laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Wilderness Act, and Endangered Species Act. Border Patrol must obtain permission or a permit from federal land management agencies before its agents can maintain roads and install surveillance equipment on these lands. Because land management agencies are also responsible for ensuring compliance with land management laws, Border Patrol generally coordinates its responsibilities under these laws with land management agencies through national and local interagency agreements. The most comprehensive agreement is a 2006 memorandum of understanding intended to guide Border --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Patrol activities on federal lands. GAO found,\\102\\ however: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\102\\ Id. Border Patrol's access to portions of some federal lands along the southwestern border has been limited because of certain land management laws, according to patrol agents-in-charge for 17 of the 26 stations, resulting in delays and restrictions in agents' patrolling and monitoring these lands. Specifically, patrol agents-in-charge for 14 of the 17 stations reported that they have been unable to obtain a permit or permission to access certain areas in a timely manner because of how long it takes for land managers to conduct required environmental and historic property assessments. The 2006 memorandum of understanding [2006 MOU] directs the agencies to cooperate with one another to complete, in an expedited manner, all compliance required by applicable federal laws, but such cooperation has not always occurred. For example, Border Patrol requested permission to move surveillance equipment to an area, but by the time the land manager conducted a historic property assessment and granted permission--more than 4 months after the initial request--illegal traffic had shifted to other areas. Despite the access delays and restrictions, 22 of the 26 agents-in-charge reported that the overall security status of --------------------------------------------------------------------------- their jurisdiction is not affected by land management laws. As an aside, I would note that ``overall security status'' is a weak benchmark by which to measure the effect of such ``access delays and restrictions,'' given that it encompasses all operations at the Border Patrol facility in question, and not individual operations. That said, the fact that these ``access delays and restrictions'' affected the overall security status at four facilities is significant, and any delays affect Border Patrol's operations, as is apparent from the cite above. The 2006 MOU \\103\\ is problematic in a number of ways, but the most fundamental issue with that MOU is that it fails to recognize the exigencies of Border Patrol operations, and in essence requires Border Patrol to seek DOI and/or USDA permission before undertaking its most critical missions. Simply put, it is a September 10 document for a post-September 11 world, and one that fails to recognize, comprehend, or appreciate the sophistication and agility of the criminal entities operating along the southwest border. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\103\\ Memorandum of Understanding Among U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture Regarding Cooperative National Security and Counterterrorism Efforts on Federal Lands along the United States' Borders (Mar. 2006), available at: https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/ articles/2010/mou.pdf. Take for example paragraph IV.A.5 in that MOU.\\104\\ It states: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\104\\ Id., at 4. The Parties will cooperate with each other to identify methods, routes, and locations for CBP-[Border Patrol (BP)] operations that will minimize impacts to natural, cultural, and wilderness resources resulting from CBP-BP operations while facilitating needed CBP-BP access . . .\\105\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\105\\ Id. By definition, such ``cooperation'' gives DOI and USDA significant say in the manner in which Border Patrol executes its mission. As a practical matter, however, it gives those departments, which do not otherwise have a significant national-security mission, veritable veto power over at least some of the ``methods, routes, and locations'' of the operations of the law-enforcement component of the United States government with expertise in border security, the Border Patrol. No one disputes the fact that ``impacts to natural, cultural, and wilderness resources'' should be minimized to the greatest extent possible. What the 2006 MOU does, however, is to put the ``environmental cart'' in front of the ``national-security horse.'' Congress should reassess the respective roles of the Border Patrol and the each of the land management agencies, to ensure that critical law-enforcement activities are not impeded in any way. Given the sophistication and funding of the entities with which it must contend, Border Patrol must be able to act swiftly, without restrictions, to respond to any criminal or national security threat that it faces. Any delay will allow those criminal organizations to exploit critical vulnerabilities along the border, a fact that can have significant safety implications for the United States, as shown above. environmental damage caused by cross-border incursions The large number of cross-border traffickers who have attempted to enter the United States illegally have caused harm to our most vulnerable, and culturally and environmentally valuable, Federal lands. Janice L. Kephart, a former National Security Fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, described some of these issues in a March 2011 post for the Center.\\106\\ To assess the environmental impact of illegal immigration on Federal lands, Ms. Kephart filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) seeking documentation related to this issue.\\107\\ As she described the results: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\106\\ Janice Kephart, My Great-Grandfather, President Obama, and Preserving Our Federal Lands, Center for Immigration Studies (Mar. 3, 2011), available at: https://www.cis.org/Kephart/My-GreatGrandfather- President-Obama-and-Preserving-Our-Federal-Lands. \\107\\ Id. Some of the material I received from the request included internal memos discussing the problem within the Department of Interior, as well as PowerPoint presentations created by Park Service personnel from the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation, Organ Pipe National Monument, and Buenos Aires Wildlife Refuge showing that nearly all national park destruction on these central Arizona border areas was due to illegal alien traffic. The threat from illegal activity is so bad, in fact, that for years the Park Service has completely closed these parks due to the ``unacceptable level of risk to the public and staff'' from the ``high level of illegal activity going on'' in these parks.\\108\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\108\\ Id. In June 15, 2006 testimony \\109\\ before the House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, Tina Terrell, then-Forest Supervisor of the Cleveland National Forest, described the impacts of illegal crossers on that forest: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\109\\ Effects of Illegal Border Activities on the Federal Land Management Agencies Before the H. Comm. on Appropriations, Subcomm. on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, 109th Cong. (2006) (statement of Tina Terrell, Forest Supervisor of the Cleveland National Forest, U.S. Dept of Agriculture, Forest Service), available at: https: / / www.doi.gov / ocl / illegal-immigration. The Cleveland National Forest in California continues to experience cross-border violators creating unwanted trails and leaving large numbers of abandoned campfires and large amounts of trash on the Forest as they travel through the area . . .. Since 1997, the Cleveland National Forest has staffed a border fire prevention and resource protection crew to remedy impacts created by cross-border violators. Their primary job is to find and extinguish illegal campfires before they expand and become wildfires. Each year these fire prevention efforts have helped reduce resource damage and wildfire costs. Despite these efforts, in 2005, over 370 acres of the National Forest burned due to illegal campfires and over 4 tons of trash was removed from the National Forest, much of which can be attributed to --------------------------------------------------------------------------- illegal immigration. She testified, however, that the effects of illegal border traffic on the Coronado National Forest had been much greater than on the Cleveland National Forest. She noted that: The natural and cultural resources on the Coronado have regional, national and international importance. There are 12 separate and uniquely distinct mountain ranges, eight designated wilderness areas, containing approximately 203 threatened, endangered, or sensitive species. These resources are suffering significant adverse impacts due to illegal border traffic. With respect to impacts to natural resources from such traffic in that forest, she asserted: Activities by cross-border violators sometimes adversely affect the natural resources we protect and manage, and interfere with authorized management activities and uses. Repeated damage to a livestock exclosure fence next to the border established to protect an endangered fish species, the Sonoran Chub, has been so extensive that the exclosure fence has had to be completely rebuilt several times and has often been rendered ineffective in restricting livestock use. This fence damage has allowed the destruction of endangered species habitat to continue and has resulted in very expensive, unplanned repairs. Literally hundreds of miles of unauthorized trails and roads have been created on the Forest by illegal foot and vehicle traffic. This proliferation of trails and roads damages and destroys cactus and other sensitive vegetation; disrupts or prohibits revegetation; disturbs wildlife, their security and travel routes; causes soil compaction and erosion; impacts stream bank stability; and puts the public at risk by creating confusion as to which routes are lawful and safe. Perhaps one of the most well[-]known of the impacts of illegal immigration is the litter left behind, which we note, tends to accumulate in higher amounts than found in other urban National Forests. Additionally, cleaning up the litter is difficult due to the lack of facilities and remoteness of the border areas. The presence of trash also detracts from scenic qualities and from the visitors' experience. Water sources near this contamination are often so fouled by pollution that wildlife can no longer use them. Where trash is left behind in designated wilderness or other areas far from roads, expensive and difficult removal by the use of horses or mules is required. Adding to the fire risk and agency expense are the hundreds of vehicles, most stolen, abandoned by smugglers and other cross-border violators or seized during law enforcement operations. Similarly, in July 2009, Fox News reported \\110\\ on a 2007 internal Federal Government memo that detailed the effect of illegal alien crossings on DOI activities at National Parks in the Southwest: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\110\\ Stephen Clark, Memo Reveals Refuge Officers' Struggle to Secure Lands Along Southwest Border, Fox News (July 9, 2010), available at: http: / / www.foxnews.com / politics/2010/07/09/federal-park- rangers-struggle-secure-public-land-southwest-border.html. According to the memo, which was obtained by FOXNews.com, the Department of Interior warns that refuge officers are spending 100 percent of their time at Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife preserve and between 90 to 95 percent of their time in Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge and Leslie Canyon dealing with border-related activities. It also notes that the Cabeza Prieta preserve is spending 60 to 70 percent of its budget on border- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- related activities. This includes everything from apprehending illegal immigrants until Border Patrol can arrive, to cleaning up the mountains of trash--about 500 tons a year--that they leave behind. More than 1,300 miles of illegal trails had been created on the refuge by illegal border-crossers, the memo says. Nor are such impacts a thing of the past. The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality manages the ``Arizona Border Trash'' website.\\111\\ It defines ``border trash'' as: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\111\\ Arizona Border Trash, Ariz. Dep't of Environmental Quality (undated), available at: https://www.azbordertrash.gov/about.html. [I]tems discarded by persons involved in illegal immigration such as plastic containers, clothing, backpacks, foodstuffs, vehicles, bicycles and paper. It can also consist of human waste and sometimes medical products.\\112\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\112\\ Id. That website explains: \\113\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\113\\ Id. The collection and disposal of waste in remote areas along Arizona's 370-mile border with Mexico poses difficult challenges. An estimated more than 2,000 tons of trash is discarded annually in Arizona's borderlands. A variety of federal and state government entities, Native American tribes and private landowners are affected by the problem, and --------------------------------------------------------------------------- addressing it requires extensive coordination. The environmental impact caused by illegal immigration, and the trash left behind, is increasingly being found in areas that are more fragile and remote. The website notes \\114\\ that border trash ``has been shown to affect human health, the environment and economic wellbeing.'' Included among the specific impacts listed \\115\\ are: ``[s]trewn trash and piles;'' ``[i]llegal trails and paths;'' ``[e]rosion and watershed degradation;'' ``[d]amaged infrastructure and property;'' ``[l]oss of vegetation and wildlife;'' and ``[c]ampfires and escaped fires.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\114\\ Id. \\115\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- According to the website,\\116\\ each of the approximately 64,900 border crossers apprehended in the Tucson Sector in FY 2016 (and others who were not apprehended) ``leave approximately six to eight pounds of trash in the desert during his or her journey.'' Disposing of this trash is costly for the communities affected: ``Landfill fees range from $37 to $49 per ton in Southern Arizona. These fees do not include costs for materials, equipment, labor and transportation for the collection and transfer of the trash to the landfill.'' \\117\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\116\\ Id. \\117\\ Id. Similar points are made in the Southern Arizona Project 2016 Border Report from BLM.\\118\\ That report states: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\118\\ Southern Arizona Project 2016 Border Report, U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (undated), available at: https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/files/ SAP%202016%20%28508%20Final%29.pdf. While smuggling has been a long term concern along on the border, by the late 1990s, illegal transnational activity was prompting safety concerns for public land users in Arizona, as well as causing adverse effects on the health of public lands themselves. Initially, most impacts were concentrated near major ports of entry such as Yuma and Nogales. However, as port enforcement increased, smugglers moved to more remote, isolated areas, including BLM-managed public lands. As law enforcement patrols increased in these more remote areas, smugglers began traveling off-road in order to evade detection. These travelers leave more than tracks. The traffic creates new, ad-hoc roads and trails, damages native vegetation and disturbs wildlife. Drug and human smuggling also generates tons of garbage, including discarded personal items, bicycles, tires and abandoned vehicles. Millions of pounds of trash and waste along with damaged roads, structures, and fences have impacted Wilderness areas, riparian habitat, and other back-country natural resources.\\119\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\119\\ Id. The danger to the environment from these activities is clear from --------------------------------------------------------------------------- that report: The Sonoran Desert boasts the highest biological variety of any North American desert. These two National Monuments exemplify this tremendous diversity. The striking vegetation protected by these monuments--saguaro cacti, palo verde, ironwood and mesquite trees, wildflowers--shape the iconic images of the American Southwest. The Monuments also protect a record of human habitation dating back more than 10,000 years. These delicate sites are easily disturbed by off-road travel. Border-related impacts are also felt on other significant public lands near the international border such as the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area and Las Cienegas National Conservation Area. Both areas contain intact examples of river and stream habitats that are rare in the Southwest. These riparian areas can also serve as expedient routes for illegal activity.\\120\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\120\\ Id. Cutting the rate of illicit cross-border traffic is critical to protecting these endangered artifacts and environmental treasures. Facilitating the law-enforcement activities of the Border Patrol will deter this flow of traffic, and ensure that these Federal lands are maintained in their natural state. Any law or regulation that impedes the Border Patrol's work, but no matter how well-meaning, will thus adversely affect the environment in both the short and long run. dangers to national park service employees Not all of the dangers posed by cross-border incursions involve the environment, however. I would be remiss if I were not to mention at this point the sacrifice of Park Ranger Kris Eggle. As the National Park Service describes \\121\\ his life: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\121\\ Kris Eggle, U.S. Nat'l Park Service (updated May 24, 2016), available at: https://www.nps.gov/orpi/learn/historyculture/kris.htm. Kristopher William Eggle was a Law Enforcement Park Ranger from Cadillac, Michigan. He was an Eagle Scout, a National Honor Society Student, and valedictorian of his graduating class at Cadillac High School in 1991. After high school, he attended University of Michigan and earned a degree in wildlife biology. Kris approached his entire life with a kind of contagious enthusiasm that could only inspire everyone who knew him. He constantly gave of himself without ever asking for anything in --------------------------------------------------------------------------- return. ***** In the wake of 9/11, Kris protected his country by intercepting thousands of pounds of illegal drugs, and guarding a 30-mile stretch of the nation's southern boundary. Kris Eggle was shot and killed in the line of duty at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, on August 9, 2002 while pursuing members of a drug cartel who fled into the United States after committing a string of murders in Mexico. He was 28 years old. The dangers facing Park Rangers generally was highlighted by a January 2012 article \\122\\ in the Seattle Times, captioned ``Park rangers' jobs increasingly dangerous.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\122\\ Craig Welch, Park rangers' jobs increasingly dangerous, Seattle Times (Jan. 2, 2012), available at: https:// www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/park-rangers-jobs-increasingly- dangerous/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- While that article discussed the risks faced by Park Rangers nationwide, it specifically quoted \\123\\ then-NPS chief spokesman David Barna, who stated: ``In California and along the border between us and Mexico, we still fight drug cartels growing marijuana.. . .'' It also noted: \\124\\ ``The job, like many in Federal law enforcement, has become more complex in recent years. With 22 parks along international borders, there are more homeland-security issues.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\123\\ Id. \\124\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Moreover, as this committee's own website \\125\\ states: ``National parks and forests have become some of the most dangerous and violent areas along the border where shootings, robberies, rapes, murders, kidnappings and car-jackings frequently occur.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\125\\ Securing our Border on Federal Lands: Problem Overview, House Comm. on Natural Resources (undated), available at: https:// naturalresources.house.gov/info/borderoverview.htm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The dangers that Park Rangers and the public face from cross-border criminals must be recognized, and eliminated. the role of border patrol enforcement in protecting the environment and land-management agency employees It is plain from the foregoing that stemming the flow of illegal border crossings serves to protect the environment, to prevent the adverse ecological impacts of cross-border traffic, and protect land- management agency employees. The work of the Border Patrol is key to protecting the environment, as the testimony \\126\\ of Jon Andrew, the Interagency Borderlands Coordinator for DOI before this Subcommittee in April 2016 made clear: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\126\\ Border Security: Consequences of Federal Lands Management Along the U.S. Border to Rural Communities and National Security: Hearing Before the House Comm. on Natural Resources, Subcomm. on Oversight and Investigations, 114th Cong. (2016) (statement of Jon Andrew, Interagency Borderlands Coordinator, Dep't of the Interior), available at: https://www.doi.gov/ocl/border-security-1. The deployment of CBP personnel, equipment and infrastructure along the southwest border has led to significant improvements in border security. These improvements have both enhanced the security of our nation, and lead to overall healthier conditions on Interior lands along the border. Many of the natural and cultural resources under Interior's responsibility have been adversely affected by illegal activities due to accumulations of trash, establishment of illegal roads and trails, and overall degradation of the environment. By deploying personnel, equipment, and infrastructure, CBP operations have reduced cross-border illegal activity and the environmental impacts of this illegal activity in a number of --------------------------------------------------------------------------- areas. Examples of infrastructure put in place by CBP include: Remote Video Surveillance System towers, Integrated Fixed Towers, rescue beacons, housing for Border Patrol agents, Forward Operating Bases (FOB), equipment storage facilities, horse corrals and mobile surveillance systems such as the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System (GBOSS) used in Arizona. In his testimony, Mr. Andrew emphasizes the cooperation between DOI and the Border Patrol in these efforts: Tactical communication needs are critical to the security of Border Patrol agents and Interior personnel and we have worked closely to assure adjustments can be made in placement and maintenance of these facilities when they are present on Interior managed lands. Maintenance of roads and fences have also become more routine through issuance of permits and rights-of-way by Interior's land managing agencies. During deployment of additional border security resources, Interior worked closely with the Border Patrol to avoid or mitigate impacts to the environment by coordinating border security work with local federal land managers. These mitigation activities have had no impact on the ability of the Border Patrol to protect the border. We have made and are continuing to make significant progress and we recognize DHS's leadership on these issues.\\127\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\127\\ Id. It is clear from the foregoing that to the Border Patrol has demonstrated respect for the environment and for protecting our national treasures on Federal lands along the border. I am not as confident as Mr. Andrew, however, about the effect that the agency's cooperation with DOI has had on its enforcement activities. Given the dangers that Border Patrol Agents face on a daily basis, and the numerous contingencies that they must constantly deal with in carrying out their mission, clear, unimpeded authority should be given to the Border Patrol to access and move on Federal land, without restriction, to enable them to carry out their statutory duties. As stated above, facilitating the ability of Border Patrol agents to perform their duties is critical not only to preventing the illegal entry of aliens into the United States, but also to keeping drugs and criminals off of American streets, and to ensuring that individuals who seek to harm our country and our citizens are not able to do so. It is also crucial to protecting the environment from the effects of illegal cross-border traffic, as well as protecting land-management agency employees. Congress must carefully review any laws that impede the Border Patrol in its law enforcement efforts, and in particular any laws that inhibit, impede, or delay access and movement by the Border Patrol to any section of the border the agency deems necessary to carry out its duties. Border Patrol must not only be allowed to move freely along the border, but it must also have the ability, in a timely manner, to construct, install, and relocate the necessary tactical infrastructure to respond to cross-border threats. It is incumbent upon Congress to assess whether any laws that inhibit such movement or the employment of such infrastructure should be restricted or waived, at a minimum to the extent necessary to ensure that the critical mission of the Border Patrol is unhindered and successful. congressional action Again, given the sophistication and the violent nature of the criminal groups controlling illicit cross-border traffic, Border Patrol must have the ability to react in a timely manner to any incursion. It is impossible to know whether a group of individuals crossing the border illegally are coming here to work, are carrying drugs, or pose a risk to the American people until they are intercepted. Congress must ensure that Border Patrol has that ability. At a minimum, Congress should review the 2006 MOU among DHS, DOI, and USDA, and assess in full the impact of that MOU on the Border Patrol's ability to perform its mission on Federal land at and near the southwest border. I would argue, however, the Congress should go further, and pass legislation to make clear that the Border Patrol has full, unfettered access of movement on Federal land, as well as unfettered access to erect tactical infrastructure and maintain access roads across such land. For that reason, I would support implementation of Division C, Title I, Subtitle A, section 1118 in H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act of 2018.\\128\\ That provision would prohibit interference with CBP on covered Federal land to execute ``search and rescue operations,'' ``patrol the border area, apprehend illegal entrants, and rescue individuals,'' and to ``design, test[], construct[], install[], deploy[], and operat[e] . . . physical barriers, tactical infrastructure, and technology pursuant to section 102 of '' IIRIRA . . ..'' \\129\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\128\\ Securing America's Future Act, H.R. 4760, 115th Cong. div. C, tit. I, subtit. A, Sec. 1118 (2018). \\129\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As stated above, Border Patrol has shown itself able to both perform its duties and to protect the environment. Further, as stated, the performance of those duties actually supports the efforts of the land-management agencies in protecting vulnerable environmental areas from the abuse inherent in illegal cross-border traffic. I would also support section 1120 in that subtitle, ``Eradication of Carrizo Cane and Salt Cedar.'' That section would direct the eradication of ``the carrizo cane plant and any salt cedar along the Rio Grande River that impedes border security operations.'' Finally, I would support section 1111 in that subtitle, which, inter alia, would amend 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1103(c) note to give the Secretary of Homeland Security waiver authority to include: [A]ll legal requirements the Secretary, in the Secretary's sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure the expeditious design, testing, construction, installation, deployment, operation, and maintenance of the physical barriers, tactical infrastructure, and technology under this section. The agencies of the United States government are all playing on the same team when it comes to protecting the American people, our national security, and the environment. It is up to Congress to help them understand that fact. ______ Mr. Westerman. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Bell to testify for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF DAN BELL, PRESIDENT, ZZ CATTLE CORPORATION, NOGALES, ARIZONA Mr. Bell. Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member McEachin, and members of the Committee, good morning. My name is Daniel Bell. I am a third-generation rancher from Nogales, Arizona. Our family has been ranching on the same piece of country just west of the city of Nogales since the late 1930s. The ranch has approximately 10 miles of actual border with Mexico, 2 miles of bollard fence, a few hundred yards of vehicle barrier, and the remaining 8 miles is a four-strand barbed wire fence. In the mid-1990s, illegal border crossers impacting the ranch were at an all time high. Groups of 50 or larger were being apprehended at any given time. Violence along the border was also spiking. In 1998, Border Patrol Agent Alexander Kirpnick was murdered by drug smugglers on our ranch. On May 12, 2010, the ranch foreman from Mexico, our neighboring ranch in Mexico, was murdered and found in a shallow grave. On December 17, 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was murdered on our neighbor's ranch directly to the north of us. And on March 27 of 2010, my friend, Rob Krentz, was murdered on his ranch in Cochise County. With the increase in illegal border crossers came an increase in fire frequency on the ranches along the border. Failure to extinguish warming fires, fires lit for those in distress, and fires lit by smugglers to create diversions were common. Year after year, fires started by illegal border crossers have cost the U.S. taxpayers millions upon millions of dollars. Much of our time on the ranch is spent fixing fences cut by illegal border crossers, dealing with trespass cattle from Mexico, and fixing water developments illegal border crossers have broken, leaving livestock and wildlife to suffer. Trash left behind by illegal border crossers is a huge problem. We have literally picked up many tons of discarded duffel bags, backpacks, clothing, water bottles, and hauled them off to the landfill, only to find them trashed again several months later. The trash left behind can be dangerous to curious livestock as well as wildlife. The situation on the ground is not good for wildlife, yet the environmental groups will throw out concerns for wildlife and endangered species to thwart border security. In many cases, the Endangered Species Act is being misapplied to species occupying the border region. More often than not, they are abundant and healthy throughout their extensive range in Mexico and as far south as South America. Along the same lines, the wilderness designations along the border have the effect of creating unenforceable corridors and pathways into the United States. Vehicle access and the use of mechanized and motorized equipment are not permitted. These are the areas that tend to be the most heavily used drug trafficking routes. Access, infrastructure, and roads are drastically needed along the international boundary with Mexico. These measures will reduce the footprint of illegal border activity and benefit the natural resources. Implementing border projects on federally owned borderland is a lengthy process. In 2001, the Border Patrol had a desire to build a 4-mile long road along the border on our ranch. Actual construction began in 2011. As of today, we can see light at the end of the tunnel, nearly 17 years later. In recent years, there has been an added emphasis on streamlining the process and implementing projects in a timely manner on the Coronado National Forest, and they have designated a border liaison to assist Border Patrol in planning and implementation. The Coronado Forest and the Border Patrol are to be commended for the many recent accomplishments along the border we see today. I can attest to the effectiveness of these measures and how illegal activity has been reduced where law enforcement has been given more access to the border. This in turn produces the footprint of law enforcement which has a positive effect on the environment. I believe that this is a good model that other Federal agencies and state land management agencies need to adopt. Over the years, I have witnessed the construction of 2 miles of bollard-style fence, 4 miles of road systems along the international boundary, the placement of remote video surveillance system towers and integrated fixed towers. Also, new border roads have enabled wildland firefighters to respond rapidly and get control of fires. Continuing to establish better access roads along the international boundary with Mexico is vital. Being able to get to the border is paramount, if one expects to defend it. There is still work to be done on what is probably some of the most challenging terrain encountered along the border. It will not be easy, but I have faith we will get it done. I have witnessed significant improvements over the past decade and it coincided with implementation of the measures that I have mentioned here today. Thank you for your time and allowing me to come before you today. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bell follows:] Prepared Statement of Daniel G. Bell, President, ZZ Cattle Corporation, Nogales, Arizona Good morning my name is Daniel G. Bell. I am a third-generation rancher from Nogales, Arizona and President of the ZZ Cattle Corporation. I am a University of Arizona Graduate with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Renewable Natural Resources, with emphasis in Rangeland Management. Our family has been ranching on the same piece of country since the late 1930s. The ranch is located west of the city of Nogales, Arizona, along the border with Mexico. The ranch is located within the Nogales Station area of responsibility in the Tucson Sector of the Border Patrol. Our ranch is nearly 40,000 acres (62.5 sq. mi.) in size and has approximately 10 miles of actual border with Mexico. Apart from a 2- mile stretch of Bollard Fence and a few hundred yards of vehicle barrier, the remainder of the international boundary with Mexico is comprised of a 4-strand barb wire cattle fence. The ranch consists primarily of four Federal grazing permits with the USDA forest service, three of which are situated directly on the international boundary with Mexico. The ranch also utilizes private land and Arizona State Trust Land. The entire ranch is subject to negative impacts revolving around illegal border crossers and drug smuggling. While there have always been impacts regarding illegal border crossers and drug smuggling on the ranch, things changed drastically in the 1990s! With the implementation of Operation Gatekeeper in California and Operation Hold the Line in Texas, illegal border traffic was essentially forced into Arizona. The increased illegal border traffic forced our border cities and towns to fortify fencing along the border, which in turn forced the illegal activity on to the adjacent ranch lands. The areas where it was once common to see one or two illegal border crossers, exploded into groups ranging in the number of 50 or more. With that increase, came increases in property damage, theft, fire frequency and violence. Our fences were being cut, watering facilities were being tampered with and drained, our houses were being broken into and valuables were taken. We even had vehicles stolen. On one occasion, the wife of one of our employees was forced at knife point to prepare meals for a small group. Upon arriving home, our employee tracked the illegal border crossers and led authorities to their location. Over the years, violence in the border region had been on the increase. Nogales Station agents had been fired upon and in a few incidents, agents were wounded by apparent sniper style shootings. In 1998, Border Patrol Agent Alexander Kirpnick was murdered as he was apprehending drug smugglers in one of our grazing pastures. On March 27, 2010 while checking livestock, watering facilities and fences, my friend Rob Krentz was murdered on his ranch in Cochise County. On May 12, 2010, the ranch foreman from the neighboring ranch in Mexico was found murdered and buried in a shallow grave after he had gone missing a month earlier. On December 17, 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, a member of BORTAC, the elite tactical unit of the Border Patrol, was murdered on the neighboring ranch to the north. His team was in the area to rid the area of violent rip-off crews that were targeting illegal border crossers and drug carriers. In addition to an increase in violence over the years, fire frequency had also increased on the ranches along the border. Failure to extinguish warming fires, along with fires lit by illegal border crossers in distress, and fires lit by smugglers to create diversions were most common. In the mid 2000s, an unoccupied house on the Bear Valley portion of our ranch was set ablaze by undocumented aliens when they attempted to light the propane powered lights. In 2011, we experienced one of the worst fire seasons ever. I believe there were 13 different fires that year that burned approximately two-thirds of the entire ranch. Only one of those fires was considered a naturally caused fire, all the others were either diversion fires or distress fires. In the years that followed, there have been many more fires started by illegal border crossers that have cost the U.S. taxpayers millions upon millions of dollars to extinguish. Because the ranch relies on only the grass production from summer monsoon rains, we utilize rotational grazing systems that allow for different seasons of use and rest. Each grazing permit is divided into fenced pastures and the livestock are moved into fresh pastures upon reaching a specified utilization level. Under normal circumstances this is a substantial undertaking with 4 separate herds and 30 pastures. When you ranch on or near the border you can expect that fences will be cut by illegal border crossers on a regular basis, causing ranchers to constantly inspect fences to ensure cattle remain in the proper pasture. Also, when the international boundary with Mexico is a 4- strand barb wire fence, you can expect to experience problems with trespass cattle from Mexico, which also takes considerable time and effort to get the cattle back to our Mexican neighbors. The rancher bears the cost of the damage at the hands of those engaged in the illegal border activity. When you live in and operate a ranch in an arid environment, water is an essential piece in the health and welfare of livestock, as well as the wildlife that have grown accustomed to the water we provide. Most of the water systems located on the ranch are outfitted with water faucets to allow anyone to get drink. Unfortunately, illegal border crossers have in many instances broken the water developments and drained thousands and thousands of gallons of water. Again, the rancher bears this cost, as well as, livestock and wildlife dependent on this vital resource. Several years ago, we participated in a University of Arizona study that estimated the additional costs that border ranchers face in the wake of illegal immigration. What the study indicated is that for every 100 pounds of weight that a calf puts on over its life on the ranch, there is an additional $15.00 in cost to the rancher. Those are the costs that I mentioned above. The average weight of a steer or heifer when marketed is 500 lbs which equates to $75.00 per head. If a ranch sold 300 head, it would equate to $22,500.00 which is a substantial additional cost. In addition to the additional costs, the trash left behind by illegal border crossers is a huge problem. We have literally picked up many tons of discarded duffle bags, back packs, clothing, water bottles and hauled it off to the landfill, only to go to the same spot a few months later and clean it up again. In recent years trash has been bagged up and hidden in shrubs to conceal the movement of the illegal border crossers. The trash left behind is not only unsightly but also can be dangerous to livestock and wildlife. Curious animals have been known to eat plastic bags containing remnants of food. Cloven hooved animals like deer, javelina and cattle have had issues with food containers like tuna and sardine cans. The cans get stuck on an animal's foot and eventually wear through the bottom of the can, causing it to ride up the animal's leg and eventually constrict the leg as the animal grows. Where border security measures are lacking, the situation on the ground is not a good for wildlife, yet ``radical environmental groups'' will throw-out concerns for wildlife and endangered species to thwart border security. Much of the area along the border is fringe habitat for so-called threatened and endangered species. In many cases, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is being misapplied to species that are abundant and healthy throughout their extensive range in Mexico and as far as South America. There is a definite double standard when the border is used to define a species' limited range in the United States to garner protections under ESA, but in the next breath we are told you can't have border security because wildlife species do not recognize borders. Along the same lines wilderness designations and natural areas along the border have the effect of creating unenforceable corridors and pathways into the United States, where vehicles, as well as mechanized and motorized equipment are not permitted. In fact, these areas are the most heavily drug trafficked routes on the ranch. We have had chance encounters with armed drug smugglers and their human mules in the Pajarito Wilderness and a local chapter of the Boy Scouts of America will not go backpacking in the area after an encounter they had on one of their field days. Wilderness areas that limit access are available to Border Patrol Agents on only foot or horseback. Access and infrastructure in the form of roads is drastically needed along the border, otherwise the area of operation remains unwieldy. By creating better access along the international boundary, the footprint of illegal border activity will be greatly reduced. With better access, infrastructure like barriers, walls and fences can be constructed. Better access will also facilitate implementation of technology in the form Remote Video Surveillance Systems (RVSS), Integrated Fixed Towers (IFTs) and Mobile Surveillance Capable (MSC) Vehicles. Agents will be more efficient in securing the border when the area they are responsible for patrolling is significantly reduced. The reality of gaining access and constructing infrastructure along the border on Federal lands is a lengthy process and it needs to be streamlined. In 2001, Border Patrol had a desire to build a 4-mile road, referred to by some as the 222-interconnector road, along the border on our ranch. Actual construction began in 2011 and as of today there is light at the end of the tunnel, nearly 17 years later. In recent years there has been added emphasis on streamlining the process and implementing projects in a timely manner. For several years now, the Coronado National Forest has had a liaison assigned, to assist Border Patrol and try to streamline projects on the Forest. The Nogales Ranger District and the Border Patrol are to be commended for many of the recent accomplishments along the border today. I can attest to the effectiveness of these measures and how illegal traffic has been reduced in areas where law enforcement has been given more access to the border. That access reduces the footprint of the illegal activity as well as the footprint required for law enforcement, which is a positive for the environment. I believe that this is a good model that other Federal and state land management agencies need to adopt. Until access and infrastructure can be established in rugged and remote areas, it is extremely important that we do not lose focus of the other important aspects of border security. Air assets like helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft, as well as drones, need to be available to detect illegal activity. Providing support from above, inserting agents, guiding them to intercept points, and providing the much-needed situational awareness. Another area of importance, especially in remote areas is the lack the necessary communications technology for both law enforcement and civilians. This is important as there are citizens out recreating in the forest despite the travel caution signage warnings of smuggling and illegal immigration in the area. [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Of course, the most crucial factor is having boots on the ground, in the right place and at the right time to intercept illegal activity. In rugged areas Border Patrol must increase horse patrols and establish Forward Operating Bases in remote areas which have been effectively used in the past. Funding State and Federal Attorneys' Offices must be adequate to assure timely prosecution of border related offenses. As part of that, ensuring that there are judicial resources in place to provide consequences to offenders is imperative. Border Patrol Ranch Liaison Programs to address concerns and gather intelligence. I am fortunate to be a part of the Citizens Advisory Boards and the Rancher Liaison Group for the Nogales Border Patrol Station. It gives me the opportunity to address security issues in areas of our operation and allows Border Patrol the ability to communicate with the public and the folks most affected by illegal activity. I view these groups as another sort of metric. My focus here today is to highlight what I consider to be useful and positive measures to help secure the border and the lands we work on. Measurables like creating access and establishing roads along the international boundary with Mexico. Being able to get to the border is paramount if one expects to defend it. Border Patrol has done an excellent job in many areas along the border and in my estimation the easier areas have been addressed. What remains on the table is probably some of the most challenging terrain encountered along the border, most of which has no vehicle access. It will not be easy, but I have faith it will get done. Over the last decade, I have witnessed the construction of 2 miles of a Bollard style fence, focusing attention to the international boundary with Mexico. The fence construction improved range condition by eliminating the constant flow of illegal border crossers that created havoc with trails and left trash throughout the landscape. It only took the resource a short time heal and become productive once again. In establishing 4 miles of road systems along the international boundary and simultaneously erecting RVSS Towers and Integrated Fixed Towers, the traffic patterns were again changed nearly overnight with the flick of switch. We were no longer getting the traffic at the ranch headquarters 7 miles from the border. Again, we were witness as the range responded and trails healed. We also noticed that there were less trespass cattle from Mexico as cuts in the barb wire fence were fewer. I even queried friends who lived in the unincorporated community of Rio Rico on the northern boundary of the ranch and asked if they were experiencing the same reductions in activity, to which the answer was yes. In the areas with better access to the border there is a notable reduction in fire frequency and with less incidence of fire spreading as the roads have enabled wildland firefighters to respond and get control of fires. As I have stated before. I have witnessed improvement over the past few years in certain areas and it has coincided with the implementation of the measures that I have mentioned to you here today. Thank you for your time and allowing me to come before you today! ______ Mr. Westerman. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Nicol to testify for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF SCOTT NICOL, CO-CHAIR, SIERRA CLUB BORDERLANDS CAMPAIGN, THE SIERRA CLUB, McALLEN, TEXAS Mr. Nicol. Thank you. I am the volunteer Co-Chair for the Sierra Club Borderlands Team, and I live and teach in McAllen, one of the safest cities in the state of Texas. My house is 12 miles north of a section of border wall. The actual border is another mile further south. The wall south of my home cuts off a World Birding Center, established to attract eco-tourism dollars to a community in one of the poorest counties in the United States from an adjacent U.S. Fish and Wildlife refuge. And like most of the rest of the 654 miles of border that already have a wall or barrier, it was built without regard for local, state, and Federal laws meant to protect the environment and border communities like mine. The authority given to DHS to selectively disregard laws it deems inconvenient when it builds walls along either the U.S.- Mexico or U.S.-Canada border should not be expanded to cover all enforcement activities on all Federal lands within 100 miles of both borders, as has been proposed. The laws that are swept aside are not merely red tape, they are critical protections that were put in place for a reason, to protect people, their communities, and the environment. The levee border wall that stands 12 miles south of my home is a prime example. Twenty-seven laws were waived to expedite its construction. The pre-existing levee was essentially a pile of earth with a gentle slope on either side that terrestrial animals could easily surmount. To convert it into a levee border wall, the river-facing side was carved away and replaced with an 18-foot tall vertical concrete slab. Like many of the levee border walls in the Rio Grande Valley, this one cuts off a portion of the lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, which was intended to provide habitat for endangered ocelots, a small wild cat. A year after the levee wall's completion, flooding of the Rio Grande inundated farmlands and refuge tracts for 3 to 4 months. Where sloping levees had been converted into levee border walls, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife reported that, ``The floodwall blocked almost all egress for terrestrial wildlife species.. . . Hundreds of shells of Texas tortoise have been found demonstrating the probability of mortality for species which could not retreat from rising water levels. The Service fears any ocelots or jaguarundi that may have been caught in these areas when water began to rise may have been malnourished, injured, or perished.'' Other walls have been built without regard for laws that protect people from unnecessary flooding. We have seen devastating floods in communities like Nogales and in protected natural areas such as Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. When walls are built across our rivers, arroyos, and flash flood zones, they catch debris, back up water as much as 6 feet deep, and cause massive damage. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act was also waived when barriers were built in the Tohono O'odham Nation in southern Arizona. Chairman Ned Norris, Jr. testified that during the building of border barriers, ``Fragments of human remains were observed in the tire tracks of the heavy construction equipment. Barriers of the border road now cross the site. Imagine a bulldozer parking in your family graveyard turning up bones.'' The expansion of waivers to cover not only the construction of walls along the border but any Border Patrol or Customs and Border Protection activity on Federal lands within 100 miles of the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada border would add to the unnecessary damage. In 2011, Ron Vitiello, who is currently the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, testified that, ``In law enforcement, we operate within the confines of the rule of law and regulations. Would our efforts be easier without these legal frameworks? Yes, it would. However, we find a way to reasonably and sensibly solve problems within the parameters of law. Does the Border Patrol face challenges with respect to operating around protected lands when they are in our enforcement zones? Yes. But, again, we have been able to establish practical solutions to allow for mission success.'' Laws have also been waived for patrol roads along the border. In addition to causing environmental harm, carving a road through a formerly roadless locale can make that area more accessible to drive-throughs by smugglers. This occurred in the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, which stated in its 2008 annual report that newly installed tactical infrastructure, ``Allowed vehicles loaded with marijuana to drive into the United States, using the new system of all- weather roads constructed by DHS. Drive-through drug loads have subsequently increased in the San Bernardino Valley.'' So, the waiving of laws has proved to be environmentally destructive, and by short-circuiting the normal deliberative process, has allowed for counter-productive activities to be undertaken. It has also hurt borderland communities. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Nicol follows:] Prepared Statement of Scott Nicol, Sierra Club Borderlands Team Co- Chair, McAllen, Texas My name is Scott Nicol. I am the Volunteer Co-Chair for the Sierra Club's Borderlands Team and I live and teach in McAllen, one of the safest cities in the state of Texas. My house is 12 miles north of a section of border wall; the actual border is another mile further south. The wall south of my home cuts off a World Birding Center, established to attract eco-tourism dollars to a community in one of the poorest counties in the United States, from an adjacent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Refuge. Like most of the rest of the 654 miles of border wall that currently stand, it was built without regard for local, state, and Federal laws meant to protect the environment and border communities like mine. The authority given to the Department of Homeland Security to disregard laws it deems inconvenient when it comes to border walls along both the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada border should not be expanded to cover all enforcement activities on all Federal lands within 100 miles of both borders, as has been proposed. This flies in the face of the basic tenet that the United States is a nation of laws, and sets a terrible precedent that could be applied to other destructive Federal projects. But the biggest problem with waiving laws is not judicial or philosophical, it is concrete. The laws that are swept aside are not merely red tape. They are critical protections that were put in place for a reason--to protect people, their communities, and the environment that we depend upon. The levee-border wall that stands 12 miles south of my home is a prime example. In 2008, 27 laws were waived to ``expedite'' construction, and it was completed in 2009. The pre-existing levee was essentially a pile of earth with a gentle slope on either side that terrestrial animals could easily surmount. To convert it into a levee- border wall, the river-facing side was carved away and replaced with an 18-foot tall vertical concrete slab. It is a barrier that is readily climbed by humans, as the ever-replenishing piles of ladders that still accumulate beside it attest to, but which animals that don't have wings or ladder technology cannot get past. Like many of the levee-border walls in the Rio Grande Valley, this one cuts off a portion of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, which was intended to provide habitat for endangered ocelots, a small wildcat with spots resembling a leopard's. With the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act waived, the wall's impact upon ocelots was detrimental. A year after the levee-wall's completion, the Rio Grande flooded, backing water up to the levees and inundating farmlands and refuge tracts for 3 to 4 months. Where sloping levees had been converted to levee-border walls, U.S. Fish and Wildlife reported that: ``The floodwall blocked almost all egress for terrestrial wildlife species. [. . .] Hundreds of shells of Texas Tortoise have been found demonstrating the probability of mortality for species which could not retreat from rising water levels. The Service fears any ocelots or jaguarundi that may have been caught in these areas when water began to rise may have been malnourished, injured, or perished.'' \\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Rationale and Justification for Conservation Measures Rio Grande Valley Sector. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Corpus Christi Ecological Services Field Office. March 9, 2011. The decision to waive laws in order to build border walls has caused harm that might otherwise have been avoided. Walls have been built without regard for laws that protect people from unnecessary flooding. We have seen devastating floods in communities like Nogales and in protected natural areas such as Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. When walls are built across our rivers, arroyos and flash flood zones, they catch debris, back up water as much as 6-feet deep, and cause massive damage. In 2008, flooding caused by the border wall in Nogales, Sonora, caused millions of dollars of property damage and was responsible for two deaths. Following that event many walls were retrofitted with gates that were intended to allow water and debris to pass through, but in 2011 and 2014 those measures failed to stop debris from piling up, flood water building up, and sections of border wall being washed away. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is, as its title implies, intended to prevent the desecration and destruction of Native American burials, a goal which one might assume would be widely shared. But when waivers were issued for border barrier construction through the Tohono O'odham Nation, the Native American Protection and Repatriation Act was suspended in the project area. The compilation of a list of laws that are to be waived implies a degree of forethought, as there is no reason to waive a law that border barriers or roads are unlikely to violate. The waiving of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act proved prescient. In 2008, Tribal Chairman Ned Norris Jr. testified that during the building of border barriers: ``. . . fragments of human remains were observed in the tire tracks of the heavy construction equipment. Barriers and the border road now cross the site. Imagine a bulldozer parking in your family graveyard, turning up bones.'' \\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Norris Jr., Ned.

U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources. Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands. Subcommittee on Fish, Wildlife and Oceans. April 28, 2008. The expansion of waivers to cover not only the construction of walls along the border, but any Border Patrol or Customs and Border Protection activity on all Federal lands within 100 miles of the U.S.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mexico and U.S.-Canada border, would add to the unnecessary damage. In light of the existing Memorandum of Understanding between Customs and Border Protection and the Department of the Interior, granting Border Patrol agents access to Federal lands there is no clear need to waive laws, environmental or otherwise, to facilitate Border Patrol activities. In 2011, Ron Vitiello, who is currently the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, testified that: ``In law enforcement, we operate within the confines of the rule of law and regulations. Would our efforts be easier without these legal frameworks? Yes, it would. However, we find a way to reasonably and sensibly solve problems within the parameters of law. Does the Border Patrol face challenges with respect to operating around protected lands when they are in our enforcement zones?

Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on National Security, Homeland Defense and Foreign Operations of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands of the Committee on Natural Resources. April 15, 2011. Since Acting Deputy Commissioner Vitiello made this statement, in a congressional committee hearing discussing a proposal to waive laws on Federal lands very similar to the one being made today, Border Patrol --------------------------------------------------------------------------- apprehensions have decreased, and seizures of marijuana have plummeted. It has been alleged that the need to comply with Federal laws when new patrol roads are established or existing roads are repaired through protected Federal lands undermines Border Patrol interdiction efforts. But in addition to the environmental harm that cutting a road through a refuge or wilderness area can inflict, carving a road through a formerly roadless area can make an area that was previously impassable to smugglers easily accessible. This occurred in the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, where 10 miles of barrier and patrol roads were built following the issuance of a waiver. Located in Arizona's southeastern corner, where the terrain is heavily eroded, with deep fissures that make much of the area impassable to vehicles. Nonetheless, in 2008 Customs and Border Protection proposed the erection of barriers and construction of a graded patrol road through the area. In response a local stakeholder who had been working with the Malpai Borderlands Group (an association of ranchers who work together to restore and maintain natural processes while encouraging ranching and other traditional livelihoods) warned: ``They are going to open 10 miles-plus of access to illegal vehicles and Border Patrol vehicles through country that has no access now. Where there are barriers west of us, the illegals had already cut them with torches. The Refuge is being compromised and so is the security of the U.S. We are furious that they can't be stopped from building this road and barriers. We can't seem to get anyone to see what the damage will be. Mark my word, within a year there will be so much increase in traffic and damage that it will never be stopped. Then DHS will say they can't figure out how to solve the huge breach in our security.'' \\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ ``Subject: Natural disaster cancels trip . . .'' Sender redacted. September 17, 2008. Email obtained by the Sierra Club via Freedom of Information Act request. Absent the need to comply with Federal laws, construction crews inflicted tremendous damage that otherwise might have been avoided. With the Antiquities Act waived, a known archaeological site which refuge managers had asked workers to avoid harming, was destroyed to create an equipment staging area. Two bodies of water that are home to fish listed under the Endangered Species Act were partially filled with loose dirt in an effort to create a roadbed. A bulldozer sank and got stuck in the resulting saturated muck in one of the ponds. As predicted, soon after the barriers and patrol road were constructed through the previously impassable terrain, refuge staff reported that the new ``tactical infrastructure'' facilitated, rather than deterred, illicit cross-border traffic. The San Bernardino National Wildlife --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Refuge's annual report for 2008 stated that this: ``. . . allow[ed] vehicles loaded with marijuana to drive into the United States using the new system of all-weather roads constructed by DHS. Drive-through drug loads have subsequently increased in the San Bernardino Valley.'' \\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, Leslie Canyon National Wildlife Refuge Annual Narrative Report Calendar Year 2008.

So the waiving of laws has not only proved to be environmentally destructive, by short-circuiting the normal deliberative process, it has allowed for counter-productive activities to be undertaken. It has also hurt borderlands communities. With the waiving of protections like the Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act, towns have flooded and borderlands residents are left with the aftermath. Expanding the waiver to include more Federal lands and more types of --------------------------------------------------------------------------- projects would expand and exacerbate these problems. ______ Mr. Westerman. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Judd to testify for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF BRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL, TUCSON, ARIZONA Mr. Judd. Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member McEachin, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. The myriad of laws, regulations, and bureaucratic policies related to federally managed and protected lands prevent Border Patrol agents in the field from fully doing their job on a daily basis. Ultimately, these laws undermine our ability to effectively and efficiently secure our borders, and put the lives of our agents and the public at greater risk. The vast majority of apprehensions made by the Border Patrol occur on the southern border with Mexico. Along this very same border, roughly 40 percent of the land that makes up our 2,000-mile long border is designated by the Federal Government as some type of Federal land. This is land that is managed, controlled, or protected by multiple agencies spread across two separate cabinet-level departments, not including the department responsible for border security. Simply looking at a map of border areas in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, one will see a landscape blanketed by Federal lands that include national conservation areas, forests, monuments, parks, recreation areas, scenic areas, and wildlife refuges. The restrictions that agents face on these lands on a daily basis are due to a laundry list of some three dozen laws that date back over a century. Even with the significant impediments to our work stemming from these legal requirements and regulations, morale among rank and file Border Patrol agents is surging, thanks to the support and backing we have received from the Trump administration encouraging agents to go out and do the job we were hired to do. In fact, from his very first week in office, President Trump has demonstrated his unwavering commitment to finally securing our land borders. On January 25 of last year, President Trump signed Executive Order 13767 to improve border security and immigration enforcement. Most relevant for the Subcommittee is Section 12 of the order, which directs the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Interior, and Agriculture, to take all appropriate action to ensure that the men and women of the Border Patrol have access to all Federal lands in order to secure our land borders. This important executive action is a crucial step to solve a problem that has long plagued the Border Patrol and our ability to do our job. As Chairman Westerman and Bishop recently saw firsthand, the challenges created by these legal requirements, rules, and policies are very real for those patrolling our borders. For example, in the Coronado National Forest within the Tucson Sector of Arizona, our inability to build proper access roads along and near the line, including secondary roads, diminishes agent mobility while patrolling, and ultimately prevents agents from being as effective as they could otherwise be. Because there is no actual east-west border road beyond the fence, which only stretches a short distance into the forest, the United States, in essence, has ceded approximately a quarter mile of U.S. territory to criminal enterprise, including drug and human traffickers. While my primary concern is overall border security, including the safety of agents and the public, I would like to highlight for the Subcommittee how unintended consequences stemming from environmental laws meant to protect our natural resources can have the opposite effect and actually harm the environment. For example, in one of my personal experiences in the mid- 2000s, in the Naco area of operations within the Tucson Sector, the Border Patrol built a continuous fence that was constructed right up to the San Pedro River within the San Pedro National Conservation Area. While we were able to continue with the construction of the fence to the west of this sensitive riparian area, due to legal restrictions, we had to wait to complete construction within the conservation area until we had the required permitting and the environmental impact studies were complete. During this long waiting period, the massive hole left in our fencing allowed criminal enterprises to drive their vehicles up to the riparian area with absolutely no regard for this environmentally sensitive area. While we now have some barriers in place that make it a little more difficult for criminal enterprises to spoil this riparian area, due to the difficulty of the laws, the barriers are a far cry from what is needed and are easily defeated. Finally, I would like to close by urging Congress to consider and pass legislation that would solve these very real problems. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the Subcommittee, Chairman Bishop, and Congressman Johnson, for your work in crafting reform language that has been included in H.R. 4760, Securing America's Future Act. This Committee's contribution to the broader border security reform is crucial to ensure that agents have the ability to properly patrol Federal lands and prevent all unlawful entries into the United States. Additionally, the Committee may want to consider an amendment to ensure that Border Patrol efforts to close off tunnels used by drug and human smugglers are not delayed or blocked by existing laws. Regardless of this amendment, by waiving the relevant environmental laws and thus eliminating the restrictions imposed on Border Patrol, the Committee's legislation will finally take the handcuffs off the agents and allow us to simply do our jobs. I want to thank the Subcommittee, and I look forward to answering any and all of your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Judd follows:] Prepared Statement of Brandon Judd, on behalf of the National Border Patrol Council, Tucson, Arizona Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member McEachin, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, I would like to thank you for inviting me to testify before you today in order to communicate the significant challenges that our Nation's Border Patrol Agents are facing, specifically when patrolling on Federal lands. My name is Brandon Judd and I currently serve as the President of the National Border Patrol Council, where I represent approximately 16,000 Border Patrol field agents and support staff. I have 20 years of experience as a Border Patrol Agent and a thorough understanding of the policies affecting border security. While this is my first time testifying before this Subcommittee, I know that both the Subcommittee and Full Committee have been working for years to address the issues before us today and I am grateful for your continued oversight and steadfast dedication to solving these problems. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to describe the current state of the border and how the myriad of laws, regulations and bureaucratic policies related to federally managed and protected lands prevent Border Patrol Agents in the field from fully doing their job on a daily basis. Ultimately, these laws undermine our ability to effectively and efficiently secure our borders and put the lives of our agents and the public at greater risk. As the Subcommittee is undoubtedly aware, the vast majority of apprehensions made by the Border Patrol occur on our southern land border with Mexico. Even though we saw apprehension numbers drop to historic lows soon after President Trump took office, the Border Patrol still made over 310,000 total apprehensions across the country during Fiscal Year 2017. Of those 310,000 apprehensions, nearly 304,000 or roughly 98 percent, occurred along the southwest border. Along this very same border, roughly 40 percent of the land that makes up our 2,000 mile-long border is designated by the Federal Government as some type of Federal land, according to a Government Accountability Office analysis. This is land that is managed, controlled or protected by multiple agencies, spread across two separate cabinet-level departments, not including the Department responsible for border security. Simply looking at a map of border areas in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, one will see a landscape blanketed by Federal lands that include National Conservation Areas, Forests, Monuments, Parks, Recreation Areas, Scenic Areas, and Wildlife Refuges. The restrictions that agents face on these lands on a daily basis are due to a laundry list of some three dozen laws that date back over a century. Even with the significant impediments to our work stemming from these legal requirements and regulations, morale among rank-and-file Border Patrol Agents is surging thanks to the support and backing we've received from the Trump administration encouraging agents to go out and do the job we were hired to do. In fact, from his very first week in office, President Trump has demonstrated his unwavering commitment to finally securing our land borders. On January 25 of last year, President Trump signed Executive Order 13767 to improve border security and immigration enforcement. Most relevant for the Subcommittee is Section 12 of the Order which directs the Secretaries of Homeland Security, the Interior and Agriculture to ``take all appropriate action'' to ensure that the men and women of the Border Patrol have access to all Federal lands in order to secure our land borders. This important executive action is a crucial step to solve a problem that has long plagued the Border Patrol and our ability to do our job. Even former President Obama's Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano acknowledged the significance of the problem when she wrote in a 2009 letter that: ``While the USBP recognizes the importance and value of wilderness area designations, they can have a significant impact on USBP operations in border regions. This includes that these types of restrictions can impact the efficacy of operations and be a hindrance to the maintenance of officer safety. The USBP, in accordance with [a] 2006 MOU [with DOI and USDA] makes every reasonable effort to use the least impacting means of transportation within wilderness; however along the southwest border it can be detrimental to the most effective accomplishment of the missions. For example, it may be inadvisable for officer safety to wait for the arrival of horses for pursuit purposes, or to attempt to apprehend smuggling vehicles within wilderness with a less capable form of transportation.'' While the ``detrimental'' impact to the border security mission is certainly concerning when reading former Secretary Napolitano's letter, what I'd like the Subcommittee to focus on for a moment are the real- life implications for agent safety--something that should be of paramount concern to everyone. To ever suggest that an agent--who is likely working alone, probably on terrain making he or she vulnerable to attack, and almost certainly in a remote location--should wait for the arrival of agents mounted on horses in order to safely make an apprehension of an illegal entrant is completely and utterly absurd. I hope that the Subcommittee would never tolerate policies of this nature and allow senior agency bureaucrats in Washington to prioritize possible impacts on the environment over the safety of the men and women of the Border Patrol. This is of particular concern at a time when we've seen a dramatic increase in assaults on agents. Just last year, assaults on Agents were up by 76 percent and totaled 774 for 2017. With the threats facing agents at an all-time high due to drug cartels, violent criminal aliens and ever-growing personnel shortages, the last thing agents need to contend with are the added burdens created by environmental laws, regulations and memos drafted by supervisors and managers sitting behind desks. As Chairmen Westerman and Bishop recently saw firsthand, the challenges created by these legal requirements, rules and policies are very real for those patrolling our borders. For example, in the Coronado National Forest within the Tucson Sector of Arizona, our inability to build proper access roads along and near the line, including secondary roads, diminishes agent mobility while patrolling and ultimately prevents agents from being as effective as they could otherwise be. Because there is no actual east-west border road beyond the fence, which only stretches a short distance into the Forest, the United States in essence has ceded approximately a quarter-mile of U.S. territory to criminal enterprise, including drug and human traffickers. While my primary concern is overall border security including the safety of agents and the public, I'd like to highlight for the Subcommittee how unintended consequences stemming from environmental laws meant to protect our natural resources can have the opposite effect and actually harm the environment. For example, in one of my personal experiences in the mid-2000s in the Naco Area of Operations within the Tucson Sector, the Border Patrol built a continuous fence that was constructed right up to the San Pedro River within the San Pedro National Conservation Area. This conservation area runs north from the border and is made up of approximately 57,000 acres of public land, managed by the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. While we were able to continue with the construction of the fence to the west of this sensitive riparian area, due to legal restrictions, we had to wait to complete construction within the conservation area until we had the required permitting and the environmental impact studies were complete. During this long waiting period, the massive hole left in our fencing allowed criminal enterprises to drive their vehicles up the riparian area along and near the riverbed, with absolutely no regard for this environmentally sensitive area. While we now have some barriers in place that make it a little more difficult for criminal enterprises to spoil this riparian area, due to the difficulty of the laws the barriers are a far cry from what's needed and are easily defeated. Tactical infrastructure and barriers, such as the fencing in Naco, are crucial to preventing illegal entries and securing our border. While there has been no shortage of debate and controversy over the proposed border wall, in my opinion serving in the Border Patrol for the past 20 years, including in the busiest sector in the history of the Border Patrol, a wall, in strategic locations is pivotal to securing our border. Without physical barriers, such as a wall, we're far less able to dictate and direct where illegal entries are made, making us less effective and inefficient. A wall in strategic locations will ultimately lead to far greater effectiveness and allow us to direct our very limited manpower resources to areas without barriers and where illegal crossings are more likely to take place. If, in the coming months and years, new plans and efforts to build physical barriers are blocked, delayed or otherwise stopped because of these environmental laws, then the safety and security of our agents and citizens will suffer greatly. Finally, I'd like to close by urging Congress to consider and pass legislation that would solve these very real problems. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend this Subcommittee, Chairman Bishop and Congressman Johnson for your work in crafting reform language that has been included in H.R. 4760, Securing America's Future Act, sponsored by Chairmen Goodlatte, McCaul, and Labrador, as well as Chairwoman McSally. This Committee's contribution to the broader border security reform effort is crucial to ensure that agents have the ability to properly patrol Federal lands and prevent all unlawful entries into the United States. While this legislation is still pending before the House, I'd like to suggest that the Committee consider amending Section 1118 to ensure that the Border Patrol can conduct proper maintenance of physical barriers, tactical infrastructure and technology on Federal lands. Additionally, the Committee may want to consider an amendment to ensure that Border Patrol efforts to close off tunnels used by drug and human smugglers are not delayed or blocked by existing laws. Regardless of these two suggestions, by waiving the relevant environmental laws and thus eliminating the restrictions imposed on the Border Patrol, the Committee's legislation will finally take the handcuffs off of agents, and allow us to simply do our jobs. I want to thank the Subcommittee for your time this morning and I look forward to answering any questions that you may have. ______ Questions Submitted for the Record by Rep. Grijalva to Brandon Judd, President, National Border Patrol Council Please answer the following questions regarding the 2014 incident you described in which Border Patrol could not fill a cross-border tunnel near the San Diego area due to the presence of a bird's nest: Question 1. What was the specific location of the opening of the tunnel? Was the opening located on Federal lands? Answer. Prior to the hearing, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) management sent one of my consultants an e-mail regarding tunnel remediation delays stemming from environmental laws. Below are the relevant portions of the e-mail with the example. The agency is the entity that provided me with this information and thus allowed me to use the information if relevant questions were asked at the hearing. The information provided by CBP does not give the specific location in San Diego of the opening of the tunnel nor if it was on Federal lands. I have no additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the agency for additional information. Email from CBP management (bold added for emphasis): ``All tunnel remediations have to go through the NEPA process. This requirement can and often does delay remediation.'' The e- mail goes on to mention, ``. . . an incident in 2014 in the SDC AOR in which a bird nesting in a tunnel delayed a remediation.'' Last, in order to better assist the Ranking Member and the Committee in its oversight, I wanted to let the Committee know that based on additional information provided by CBP, 194 illicit cross- border tunnels have been discovered nationally since Fiscal Year 2000. Based on the CBP data, four cross-border tunnels were discovered during Fiscal Year 2014 in the San Diego Sector. Question 2. What species of bird occupied the nest near the tunnel opening? How close was the nest to the tunnel opening? Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the agency for additional information. Question 3. Which Federal agency directed Border Patrol to postpone filling the tunnel until the bird's eggs had hatched? Under what authority or environmental law was this directive given? Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the agency for additional information. Question 4. How long did the tunnel remain unfilled since being discovered? How much of this time was due solely to the presence of the bird's nest? Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the agency for additional information. Question 5. Was an environmental impact statement required to fill the tunnel? Has Border Patrol established a categorical exclusion under NEPA for filling cross borders tunnels? If not, why not? Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the agency for additional information. Question 6. Has the tunnel since been filled? If not, why not? Is the portion of the tunnel on the Mexico side of the border filled? Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the agency for additional information. Other questions for Mr. Judd: Question 7. What was NBPC's involvement in Mark Morgan's dismissal? Answer. The first time I was made aware that former Chief Mark Morgan was being dismissed was on the morning of January 26, 2017 when CBP Acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan called me and informed me he made the decision to remove Chief Mark Morgan from his position as the Chief of the Border Patrol. There were several NBPC officers with me when Acting Commissioner McAleenan called me. The call was professional and appropriate. Acting Commissioner McAleenan knew I would get numerous questions from the media and he asked that, ``I do not dance on his grave.'' I am not aware that I or NBPC played a role in Chief Morgan's dismissal and I certainly never asked Acting Commissioner McAleenan to remove Morgan. Furthermore, I am not aware of any statute, regulation or policy that would have given me, as a GS-12 Border Patrol Agent and President of the NBPC, or the NBPC itself, the authority to determine the employment status of any CBP employee, including the Chief of the Border Patrol. As per the call referenced above with Acting Commissioner McAleenan, he made it very clear that the decision to remove Chief Morgan was his and his alone. At the time he was appointed to be the Chief, Chief Morgan was a retired Federal employee and was hired to the Chief's post as a rehired annuitant and therefore did not have the protections of a career employee. Acting Commissioner McAleenan was free to dismiss him without the customary formalities because he was not a career employee but rather was a rehired annuitant. What is true and is well known is that I, acting on behalf of the bargaining unit as the President of the NBPC, believed there was a culture problem in the Border Patrol and continue to hold this belief to this day. When Chief Morgan was selected, I was informed that he was selected to bring about a much needed culture change. I was publicly supportive of his selection but quickly became disenchanted due to the fact that he surrounded himself with the same management officials who were the cause of the culture problems. During his short tenure the culture did change but changed for the worse, as those same people who were in part responsible for the agency's long-standing culture problems were emboldened when Chief Morgan failed to make needed changes. Sadly under his watch there was less accountability in the agency and that lack of accountability continues to this day. Question 8. Has NBPC ever condemned the use of excessive force? Answer. Yes. The NBPC does not and will not condone ``excessive force.'' Excessive force is against the law and I personally do not know any Border Patrol Agent who believes it is acceptable for law enforcement officers/agents to break the law. The NBPC does believe in due process for all persons including those accused of crossing the border illegally, as outlined in law, and that also includes any law enforcement officer/agent accused of excessive force. Question 9. The FBI has not found any evidence to suggest that the death of Border Patrol agent Rogelio Martinez was caused by an attack. What evidence does NBPC use when continuing to characterize this incident as a ``heinous attack?'' Answer. On Monday, November 20, 2017, El Paso Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Richard C. Whitman sent an e-mail to one of my former Local Presidents in which he describes the death of BPA Rogelio Martinez as a ``heinous attack.'' When speaking with the media since the incident, I have been using the verbiage given to NBPC by management officials in the Border Patrol. The following is the text of the e-mail in its entirety. ``I'm sure you are aware of the LOD death of the BBT agent and his partner that is in serious condition. While FBI has the lead, HQ/OBP has directed EPT to throw as much personnel and resources as possible to assist in locking down that area to locate the perpetrators of this heinous attack [emphasis added]. Obviously, this will cause an additional strain on EPT's already thinly spread staffing. The details on what this might look like are still being put together. To this end, I was wondering if the Agency were to grant a blanket extension on grievances, replies, etc., would you support a moratorium on official time?'' Furthermore, the morning following Agent Martinez' death a Supervisory Border Patrol Agent from the El Paso Sector sent the following text message to several individuals. Please forgive any punctuation or grammar mistakes, I am quoting the text message verbatim: ``2 agents got assaulted in Van Horn last night and got airlifted to UMC. There was a sensor activation and 1 agent responded went back to his vehicle to call out that the sensor was good. Not sure what happened after that but I'm hearing he got jumped by 6 mules and had his face basically smashed in. 2nd agent arrived to help out with trail without knowing 1st agent had been assaulted and he also got jumped. Word is 1st agent passed away and 2nd agent is in critical but stable condition. They r back tracking the group south of van horn. Everyone's been activated. We sent 3 guys to assist'' As you can clearly see, it was Border Patrol management that characterized the death of Rogelio Martinez as an attack. NBPC had no reason to believe the information by the agency itself was incorrect. ______ Mr. Westerman. I say thank you to all of the witnesses for your testimony. I would like to remind the members of the Committee that Committee Rule 3(d) imposes a 5-minute limit on questions. I will now recognize Members for any questions they may wish to ask the witnesses. I will recognize myself to start with for 5 minutes. I also remind the witnesses that we are going to keep this to 5 minutes per person. We have votes coming up here shortly, so if we cut you off, it is because we have a lot of questions we want to ask. My first question is for the whole panel. There is a graphic up here, the one on the top left shows a lot of ad hoc roads along the border. You see examples of the trash that we talked about in some of these areas. [Slide.] In March of 2010, then-Secretary Salazar, while on a border visit with Ranking Member Grijalva, stated that, and I quote, ``Deterring unlawful activity along the border is the best option for preventing damage to cultural and natural resources and minimizing risks to visitors and employees.'' The Fish and Wildlife Service found almost 8,000 miles of ad hoc roads used by cross-border violators in the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge. Millions of pounds of trash and waste are collected from layup areas. Wildland fires are also often ignited by border violators. I want to ask each of you a simple yes or no question. Do you agree with Secretary Salazar's statement that deterring unlawful activity along the border best protects our natural resources? Mr. Arthur. Yes. Mr. Bell. Chairman Westerman, yes. Mr. Westerman. Mr. Nicol, yes or no? Mr. Nicol. It is more complicated than that, unfortunately. Mr. Westerman. Mr. Judd? Mr. Judd. I do agree, yes. Mr. Westerman. OK. Mr. Bell, as a third-generation rancher along the southern border, you have experienced firsthand the impact illegal activity can have on Federal lands. Can you briefly describe for us how Border Patrol's increased presence and infrastructure has improved the health of your grazing land? Mr. Bell. We have a permit that we graze cattle on called the Mariposa, and when we started grazing there, there was so much illegal activity and trash and trails and trespass from Mexican cattle, we were unable to actually go in there because utilization levels of the grass were already hit. Once Border Patrol established a presence on the border, put in a portion of the bollard-style fence, we were able to start using that the next season. It healed that quickly. Mr. Westerman. OK. Mr. Judd, a 2006 Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of the Interior, Agriculture, and Homeland Security attempted to provide guidance and increase coordination between Customs and Border Protection and Federal land managers to balance border security and environmental issues. In what ways is this MOU insufficient for Border Patrol agents' needs? Mr. Judd. It is the large bureaucracy that the government currently has. When we have to go and discuss issues with so many different agencies to try to make something happen, we see what happened in the San Pedro riparian area. We weren't able to build the barriers that were necessary, which allowed the human and narcotics smugglers to ruin that area for a time until it was able to heal, which took several years. But to even put Normandy-style barriers in that area took about 2 years, just to be able to do that. Mr. Westerman. And, Mr. Arthur, based on your experience drafting some of the most significant border security laws since September 11, 2001, what would you change in the 2006 MOU to ensure that Border Patrol can accomplish its mission on Federal lands? Mr. Arthur. I would actually refer to the way that the MOU operates. Right now, it puts environmental agencies in charge of border security. Law enforcement should be the entity that actually controls the process rather than the other way around. Mr. Westerman. OK. Mr. Judd, as mentioned in my opening statement, during my visit to the southern border, we heard from Border Patrol about tunnels being used for drug smuggling, and you referenced that as well. Can you briefly explain the statutory and regulatory obstacles that agents face when trying to remediate one of these cartel tunnels? Mr. Judd. Just to remediate a tunnel, we have to follow the NEPA laws. And in 2014, in San Diego, we had a tunnel that we were not able to remediate because a bird had nested in that area and we had to wait until the eggs hatched before we could remediate that tunnel. The problem with that was that we had to allocate resources to guard that tunnel, which then left other areas on the border unsecured, which allowed the cartels to exploit that area. We have to be able to remediate these tunnels immediately. Mr. Westerman. OK. And I am going to stick to my rule, not going past 5 minutes, or the Committee Rule. So, I won't ask a question where you only have a few seconds to answer. With that, I will recognize the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee, Mr. McEachin, for questions. Mr. McEachin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Arthur, is your Center for Immigration Studies the same one that was founded by John Tanton? Mr. Arthur. It was not founded by John Tanton. Mr. McEachin. Was it founded in 1985? Mr. Arthur. It was founded in 1985. I only began working-- -- Mr. McEachin. Thank you. That answers my question. Mr. Nicol, there has been some suggestion by some of the witnesses here that the Border Patrol has been handcuffed. And I assume by being handcuffed, we are talking about handcuffed by environmental and public policy safety laws. What rights and protections do these so-called handcuffs help to keep in place? Mr. Nicol. I think it is important to see the interaction between the Border Patrol and land management agencies as a net positive. You have two different agencies that are responsible for work in a given area, they should be working together to minimize the kind of harm that could be done. Giving one an upper hand over the other is not helpful in any way. Mr. McEachin. All right, sir. The Chairman asked a yes or no question concerning a quotation from a few years back. You gave the answer, it is more complicated than that. Do you care to elaborate on your answer at this point? Mr. Nicol. Certainly. Trash can be remediated fairly easily, it can be picked up. Trails that somebody leaves walking across the border can heal themselves relatively quickly. If the laws are waived to build border walls, those walls cause significantly more damage, they tend to dam water, they cause flooding, the roads that have been carved through are far worse than trails. So, yes, it is good to limit the amount of trash that is left behind. But if the measures that are used to do that are more destructive than the trash itself, then that is a bigger problem. Mr. McEachin. Thank you. It also has been suggested that public land management agencies like the Department of the Interior and the USDA are to blame for delays in Border Patrol's border security efforts. However, it is my understanding that these public land agencies hold an MOU with the Department of Homeland Security that helps to ensure cooperative management of border security on public lands. In fact, both Customs and Border Protection and the Department of the Interior have submitted testimony to this Subcommittee before saying that the MOU is working well. To your knowledge, is this MOU working as it was intended? Mr. Nicol. I think generally it is. I think that there are going to be issues in which one agency or the other, I think this goes on both sides, feel that things did not go as quickly as they would like. I think one thing that might slow things down is the lack of biologists within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife. They have had a decreasing workforce, so possibly hiring some more biologists would help things like that to speed up. But I think overall it has been a positive. Mr. McEachin. That is probably a nice segue into my final question to you. How do you think the severe funding cuts proposed for the Department of the Interior and the USDA in the President's Fiscal Year 2019 budget will affect their ability to make land management decisions along the border? Mr. Nicol. It will have a tremendous impact. These land management agencies also have their own law enforcement officers. If they don't have the funds to hire those officers or retain those officers, if they don't have people on the ground in these places, they are less able to do their jobs and they are also less able to work with Border Patrol. Mr. McEachin. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, while that concludes my questions, I would ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the evidence that led the Southern Poverty Law Center to declare the Center for Immigration Studies a hate group. Mr. Westerman. Without objection. The Chair will now recognize the Vice Chair of the Committee, Mr. Johnson from Louisiana, for 5 minutes. Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Judd, I had a couple of questions for you. I want to thank you for your service first, and just kind of highlight some of the things you have said here today and what you have presented. On page 2 of your submitted testimony, you focus on the real life implications for agency safety, and you talked about that this morning. Specifically, something that really drew my attention from page 2 of your written testimony, you say, ``This is a particular concern at a time when we have seen a dramatic increase in assaults on agents. And just last year, assaults on agents were up 76 percent. They totaled 774 for 2017.'' It is a dangerous job, and I think the American people recognize that or are beginning to appreciate it more. And we need to do all we can, that is our commitment, to assist you all and protect those who protect us. Since my time is limited, I am not going to repeat everything you stated in those comments, but I do want to associate myself with that because I think your comments well articulate the importance of the topic that we are discussing today. But here is my question. In your testimony, you also raise the point of how unintended consequences of environmental laws, which are meant to protect our national resources, are actually harming the very areas they are supposed to protect. I am curious, in your personal experience that you related in your testimony, specifically with regard to the Naco area of operations, this is where the Border Patrol was required to leave the conservation area alone until it received the necessary permits and completed the environmental impact studies. You mention that you had a long waiting period in that interim time, but you didn't say exactly how long. I know you probably cannot give a detailed number of days, but approximately how long was that waiting period? Are we talking weeks, months, a year? How long was it? Mr. Judd. To the best of my recollection, it was approximately 2 years. Mr. Johnson. So, for nearly 2 years, for that amount of time, there was a massive hole that allowed criminal enterprises to drive their vehicles along areas that were intended to be nationally protected areas. Is that right? Mr. Judd. Yes. I personally chased several of these vehicles that crossed the border in that area. Mr. Johnson. I think the importance of this hearing today is that I don't think the American people are aware of how nonsensical these things are and that it is jeopardizing our public safety. I am so grateful you brought it. It is very frustrating to all of us, and it must be very frustrating to the agents on the ground. I can just imagine what they must be saying about Congress and those who are making these laws. Does it affect morale in that way? I know you said morale is trending upward, thankfully, because of the Administration's appreciation and the increasing awareness of all this. But that has to be a problem on the ground, right? Mr. Judd. I believe that all individuals want to feel like they are productive. I remember the best job that I ever had was when I worked construction when I was a college student. I was able to leave the construction site, look back and see what I accomplished. Border Patrol agents want to feel exactly the same way. They want to feel like they are in fact securing the border. Mr. Johnson. I appreciate that. I had one question for Mr. Nicol with regard to testimony you just gave. I think I heard you say that the trash that is left behind can be picked up, collected easily. Am I characterizing your response? Mr. Nicol. A lot more easily than remediating problems that are caused by border walls and patrol roads, yes. Mr. Johnson. The reason that piqued my interest is that we know that Border Patrol estimates that every CBV leaves approximately 8.5 pounds of garbage behind, each individual. So, if you do the math, based on the Border Patrol's conservative estimate of 1.3 million known CBVs, that means illegal immigrants and smugglers left approximately 11,050,000 pounds of trash over a 3-year period. Are you suggesting today that that is an easy thing to control and pick up? Mr. Nicol. Again, the amount of harm that that does to an environment, it is significant, but it is far less than the amount of harm done by border walls or by roads that are cut through roadless areas. Mr. Johnson. But just so we are clear. Are you saying that 11 million pounds of trash is an easy thing to contain and control? Because I thought that is what you said a few minutes ago. Mr. Nicol. It is matter of which one is greater, which does the greater harm. Mr. Johnson. OK. I will yield back. Mr. Westerman. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member for 5 minutes, Mr. Grijalva. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Chairman, the Committee staff, Mr. McEachin's Subcommittee staff, searched long and hard for an example which was in Mr. Judd's testimony of a tunnel that was never closed or never mitigated because of environmental regulations or laws. The example that he just gave about San Diego, I would request, Mr. Chairman, that you share the information with the staff so we can look at that, because we could not find any information on that example right there. Mr. Nicol, the Majority is going to have us think that local communities are so overwrought by border crossers and things that they leave behind, that border communities should be thrilled to surrender their rights and their decision making to the Department of Homeland Security. That is not my experience from my own discussions with people in my district. However, how do border communities you have talked to, that you worked with, feel about surrendering these prerogatives or rights, essentially against their will? Do you think the right to clean water or due process is red tape? Number one. Because I think that we are minimizing the effect on people themselves that live there and have lived there for generations. I would like to know if you could respond to that, please. Mr. Nicol. Thank you. I live in a border community. I live in McAllen, Texas, just a few miles north of the border. The general feeling among people who are aware of the waiver of laws that is in place currently for the wall is a sense of offense. That we don't have the same level of legal protections that the rest of the country has. That someone in the interior of the Nation has the protection of the Safe Drinking Water Act, but the Safe Drinking Water Act was waived to build the border wall. All of my drinking water has to come through that to get to my home because all of my drinking water comes out of the Rio Grande. We live in safe communities. McAllen is one of the safest communities in Texas. El Paso is one of the safest communities in the United States. Border communities are not over-run horrifying, dangerous war zones. They are safe. They are quiet. If anything, they are a little boring. The idea that we need to suspend the rule of law, and that only our safe communities get the rule of law suspended is, frankly, offensive to many people that I know. Mr. Grijalva. And for local governments in those communities, those towns, those counties, how do they feel about having their legal requirements subject to basically irrelevance by the Department of Homeland Security and Border Patrol? Mr. Nicol. I think it is the same basic thing. It also makes for a lot of legal uncertainty. You had the El Paso Water District challenge the waiver back in 2009 because they didn't know what their legal framework was to draw water out of the Rio Grande, if the laws had been waived, if the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act had been waived. So, I think it causes a tremendous amount of difficulty. It is a very broad- brush approach to waive everything. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you. Mr. Judd, if I may, just one question. On February 2 of last year, San Diego's NBPC Local 1613 said in a tweet that appears to now have been deleted, ``It is morning in America. With new leadership having the will to secure the border, a Hemingway quotation follows: Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never really care for anything else thereafter.'' This tweet was deleted. I just want to ask you, do you stand by that quote or are you aware of that quote, Mr. Judd? Mr. Judd. I personally had that quote deleted. I made sure that quote was deleted. Mr. Grijalva. Why? Mr. Judd. I didn't think that quote was appropriate. Mr. Grijalva. About the hunting of man? Mr. Judd. That is correct. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Westerman. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert, for 5 minutes. Mr. Gohmert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Nicol, in your testimony, you said, as I read it, ``laws that are swept aside are not merely red tape. They are critical protections that were put in place for a reason--to protect people, their communities, and the environment that we depend on.'' Is that your belief? Mr. Nicol. Yes, it is. Mr. Gohmert. But, apparently, it is only your belief when it comes to certain laws, but it is not your belief regarding laws about our border. Would you be happier if there were no U.S.-Mexico border? Mr. Nicol. I am concerned about a lot of different laws, including---- Mr. Gohmert. Let me ask it again, and listen real carefully. Would you be happier if there were no U.S.-Mexico border? Mr. Nicol. No. Mr. Gohmert. You would not. So, you are OK with a border as long as it is not enforced and there is no wall, correct? Mr. Nicol. The border has been enforced for a long time before there was a wall. The wall is not necessary for---- Mr. Gohmert. Well, you are not answering my question. Because the fact is, when we have a national park that allows people to come in, drug smugglers, to use the park at will, and they destroy the park, they leave tons of trash, and we cannot allow our enforcement people to go out there and stop them, then that is not enforcing the border. And when we put up a sign that, to me, is the most repugnant thing we can do to American citizens that says, look, basically, drug cartels have taken over our park, you will be safer if you don't use this area, go north of I-10, that is completely neglecting our duty as the U.S. Government and our oath to protect this country. And I know you have such great judgment. I have certainly had my disagreements with Mr. Cornyn, our Senator, but isn't it true you said in response to John Cornyn's statement regarding Dreamers, ``He forgot to add that he is a tool with no scruples and his head looks like a thumb with a face drawn on it.'' Aren't those your words? It was your post, wasn't it? Mr. Nicol. Yes. Mr. Gohmert. And another post here, ``We all know Ted Cruz is slimy and evil,'' and that, ``if he were to crawl back under the rock from whence he was spawned, the world would be a better place.'' That was one of your posts. But you also post that you would like to see more of a coming together between the sides. Isn't that right? Mr. Nicol. Those are personal, yes. But I do feel that it would make far more sense to have immigration---- Mr. Gohmert. All right. Well, let me ask you about this, since I get to ask questions. Another entry you had is that, ``It is important to have some historical perspective and understand the racist reasons that our immigration laws were put in place.'' Let me ask you, have you ever heard of MS-13? Mr. Nicol. Yes. Mr. Gohmert. You know who they are. Have you seen the kind of hideous murders they have inflicted upon Americans in the United States? Have you seen that? Mr. Nicol. I have read about them, yes. Mr. Gohmert. Yes. OK. And how about ISIS? You are familiar with who and what ISIS is, correct? Mr. Nicol. Yes. Mr. Gohmert. And you are aware that they have made plans, and the FBI Director has testified that we now have ISIS in every state. He said there is an investigation in every state in the Union. Are you aware of that? Mr. Nicol. Yes. Mr. Gohmert. And it was the FBI Director, even though people made fun of me for pointing out and quoting the FBI Director, he said that there are Middle Eastern terrorists who have changed their names to sound Hispanic and sneak across the U.S. border so that they can do damage in this country. That is also a threat. We also have people like Kim Jong-un that has made clear he wants to destroy our Nation. We also know that drug cartels' estimated about $80 billion or so last year that they brought in that has done massive damage on the rule of law in Mexico. It is why Mexico is not one of the top 10 economies in the country. And, I would just suggest to you, that, hopefully, we will do as the Secret Service found when they raised the wall and the fence around the White House by 5 feet, fences and walls work. If they don't, as I told the head of the Secret Service, then tear down the wall around the White House. They haven't seen fit to do that. I yield back. Mr. Westerman. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Huffman, for 5 minutes. Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the witnesses for being here. Environmental protections and bedrock environmental laws like NEPA are in place so that we can protect communities and the resources they depend on and provide an opportunity for public input into land management decisions. And, unfortunately, although I have heard my colleagues across the aisle many times say that local voices are the most important, it seems that it is only certain voices that matter and there is some selective listening going on. They seem to hear only the local voices that they agree with when it comes to things like national monuments and certainly with this rhetoric around border security we are hearing today. Ignoring tribal rights, community voices, and our country's laws, as some are proposing, doesn't help solve problems, but it does advance President Trump's very authoritarian, dystopic agenda. In fact, today, it looks like we are having a blue light special, a two-for-one on scapegoating. We get to scapegoat environmental laws and Mexicans at the same time, so what an irresistible opportunity for this authoritarian agenda. * * * * * Mr. Gohmert. I would ask that the gentleman's words be taken down. He has impugned my motivation, and it is entirely inappropriate. It violates the rules of decorum in the House, and it is simply not true. I did not scapegoat any Mexicans---- Mr. Huffman. Mr. Chair---- Mr. Gohmert [continuing]. So, I ask the rule---- Mr. Huffman [continuing]. The clock is running during Mr.-- -- Mr. Gohmert. Yeah, he is going to have a whole time---- Mr. Westerman. The gentleman will suspend. Mr. Gohmert [continuing]. As long as it doesn't violate the rules. Mr. Westerman. Does the gentleman wish to take down his words? Mr. Gohmert. Yes, I do. Mr. Huffman. He can do whatever he would like. I haven't violated any rules. Mr. Westerman. We need to consult for just a moment. Can the official reporter report the words? Will the official reporter report the words? [Discussion off the record.] Mr. Huffman. Mr. Chair, may I be heard for a point of clarification? Mr. Westerman. Still waiting for counsel. We will be right back. Mr. Huffman. I think we might be able to obviate some of the further delay and inquiry. The gentleman from Texas, when he interrupted and I did not yield, but he did ask a question during that point about his personal motivation, and I answered in the affirmative. I am happy to withdraw that because, frankly, my earlier point was a rhetorical point about the effect of the hearing and not about any individual Member's personal motivation. So, if withdrawing that colloquy, which I hadn't yielded for in any event, but I am happy to withdraw it, would move us forward, I would be happy to do that. Mr. Westerman. The gentleman from Texas. Mr. Gohmert. If I might respond. I would gladly accept that withdrawal, but I hope the gentleman understands, under the rules of decorum, if someone uses words that impugn a Member of Congress' integrity or motivation, I know it is not normally polite to interrupt, but if there is no challenge to have the words taken down while that speaker is still speaking and present, then you waive the right, and that was why I interrupt. Otherwise, I would apologize for interrupting because it was your time, but that is the only time I have to make clear ``were you speaking directly to me?'' And on the gentleman's explanation, I appreciate it. And my request for his words to be taken down is withdrawn. Thank you. Mr. Westerman. Does the gentleman wish to withdraw his words? Mr. Gohmert. And I would ask that his time be restored too. Mr. Westerman. Does the gentleman wish to withdraw his words? Mr. Huffman. I am happy to withdraw the words as the gentleman just---- Mr. Gohmert. Thank you. And, Mr. Chairman, I---- Mr. Westerman. Without objection, the words are withdrawn, and the gentleman may resume and ask questions. Mr. Gohmert. And his time be restored because he shouldn't be charged for my---- Mr. Westerman. And his time will be restored. Mr. Gohmert. Thank you. Mr. Westerman. Please add 1 minute to the clock. Mr. Huffman. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Gohmert. And certainly, I don't offer any words about individual motivations, but my rhetorical point about the effect of this hearing being one of scapegoating Mexicans and the environmental laws at the same time, I stand by completely. Now, Mr. Nicol, you have already pointed out that where border infrastructure projects fail to fully consider impacts, local communities were left to deal with the consequences of that. And you mentioned eco-tourism, which is a large part of your local border economy. According to a 2011 study, nature tourism contributes roughly $460 million to the economy in south Texas every year. Could you please elaborate on the economic impacts of the border wall that cut off the World Birding Center? And then, maybe also speak to how you expect increased wall construction to impact wildlife and related eco-tourism that drives economic development in border communities. While you are at it, it has been suggested that protecting wildlife is perhaps a rationale for this wall. I found that very creative, almost as good as the one from the President about putting solar panels on the wall, and now suddenly, we are for renewable energy. This wall can mean many things to many people and, apparently, it is now a wildlife wall to some people. I would appreciate your thoughts on that rationale. Mr. Nicol. Certainly. As far as eco-tourism is concerned, the wall that is south of my house was built between a World Birding Center that a local community established to try to tap into the some of the eco-tourism dollars that come to south Texas every year. We are in a migratory flyaway. All the birds heading north and south from about the Rockies to the East Coast bottle up and come through our area. So, in the fall and the spring, eco-tourism and bird watching are a tremendous part of the local economy. The wall that was put up between the World Birding Center and the adjacent wildlife refuge, which is where all the habitat for the birds actually is, has a gate on it. The locals were promised that that gate would be opened during regular business hours. It has never been opened. There is a sign that points to it saying, ``Pedestrian walking trail this way,'' but the gates never open so the birders can't go there. If the same thing is done at the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, the National Butterfly Center, Bentsen-Rio Grande State Park, and World Birding Center, all of which are on the map for President Trump's proposed walls, we can expect the same sort of thing. And even if the gate is opened, it is hard to imagine that very many tourists would want to go between prison bars to go see the birds they are interested in. It is not a very good vacation option. As far as the wildlife is concerned, the levee wall in particular is terrible for wildlife because it takes an easy slope and turns it into a sheer cliff, essentially an 18-foot tall slab of concrete. And when we get floods, the wildlife is trapped, so you turn a wildlife refuge into a wildlife deathtrap. There is no way that an ocelot can get over that. People get over it pretty easily. There is usually a pile of ladders stacked up at the end of the wall. But for something that can't fly or can't build a ladder, the wall becomes a deathtrap. Mr. Huffman. What about the antelope that were referred to earlier as being impacted by illegal immigration, an antelope or mobile migratory animals? Does the construction of a continuous border wall impact the wildlife corridors that species like that would normally---- Mr. Nicol. The antelope, that was out in Arizona. I have read that report as well. The report did not say that it was just because of cross-border traffic. It was the whole package of enforcement and traffic that impacted those animals. So, it was also including the walls, the roads, patrols, helicopters, and everything else. Mr. Huffman. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Westerman. The gentleman yields back. If you notice, votes were just called, but we want to try to get one more round of questioning in. And I want to recognize the Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Bishop from Utah, for 5 minutes. Mr. Bishop. Thank you. Let me see if I can get a few of these things in here quickly and change the focus back to what we are talking about. Mr. Arthur, very quickly, is there a conflict between the missions of the Interior Department and Homeland Security? Mr. Arthur. They can work together, but they actually have two very different missions. And, quite frankly, when they do work together, when we do enforce our---- Mr. Bishop. It works real well. Mr. Arthur. It works best, yes. Mr. Bishop. But that requires personality, which is something we don't--we legislate on worst-case scenario, not on best-case personality. Mr. Bell, is the violence that you are witnessing on the border increasing or decreasing? I knew the Krentz family. I feel bad about everything. Is it increasing? Mr. Bell. Where we have seen the access granted and the infrastructure and the road systems come in, we see less activity if there is less conflict. We don't run into folks. There hasn't been very much violence in our area. We do know that assault on agents is up, though. I belong to the Citizens Advisory Committee for our Nogales Border Patrol Station, and the statistics are up on that. And we get briefed on that regularly. Mr. Bishop. OK. Mr. Judd, we are talking here not necessarily about a wall. We are talking about access. The Border Patrol needs the access that happens to be there. Have you served in other areas? You have served in Tucson, right? Mr. Judd. I have. I have also served in California, Maine, and Montana. Mr. Bishop. How many apprehensions did you have in Maine in a year? Mr. Judd. At my station, we had maybe two a year. Mr. Bishop. A little bit fewer than in Tucson. Mr. Judd. Yes. Mr. Bishop. Which means the history is somewhat cyclical. It also means that each border area is different. And having a one-size-fits-all MOU probably does not meet all the circumstances. So, for example, historically, San Diego is the entrance port of choice, until they actually waived those iconic bedrock laws and build a fence, and then it kind of shifted over to the Tucson Sector. Rio Grande actually has more, but there is a different kind of personality going across. Rio Grande, a lot of those illegals that are coming across are kids, women, but in Tucson, isn't that mainly adults, males? Mr. Judd. It is, yes. Mr. Bishop. So, in each of these sectors, what we really need to have for the Border Patrol to be effective is to give them flexibility to meet the differences of those situations and give them access. This is what I really want you to talk to me about, because when we were down there, you explained why east-west access is so significant. If somebody is crossing the border illegally and you have the ability of finding that out, what is your method? What do you try to do to catch those people? Mr. Judd. Well, what you want to do is you want to box those individuals in between two agents, because if you can do that, your effectiveness goes sky high. Whereas, if you are chasing from behind, the chances of you actually catching those individuals are nearly none. Mr. Bishop. So, to do that, you need different kinds of access points, one at the border wall, one further up there, further up again. You need to be able to go behind the group as well as in front of the group. Mr. Judd. To be effective, we have to have those. Mr. Bishop. And that is where the east-west access becomes critical. Mr. Judd. Absolutely. Mr. Bishop. Do you have a problem with maintenance of access routes that you already have? Mr. Judd. No, we don't. Mr. Bishop. All right. But you do need significantly more, as we were talking, were we in the Coronado at the time? Mr. Judd. We were, yes. Mr. Bishop. All right. Is there the ability of getting that access point right along the border so you can have somebody behind as well as somebody in front? Mr. Judd. We could absolutely build a border road that would help us be effective. Mr. Bishop. Is it there now? Mr. Judd. It is not. Mr. Bishop. Why not? Mr. Judd. The environmental laws, frankly. Mr. Bishop. You mean to tell me that sometimes it takes so long to get approval from the land managers, you don't even have time, you don't even ask the question? Mr. Judd. Oftentimes, we just don't even want to go through the process because we know what the outcome is going to be. Mr. Bishop. Borderland has a specific meaning, correct? Mr. Judd. It does, yes. Mr. Bishop. It is 100 miles. Mr. Judd. Yes. Mr. Bishop. It is different. And some of the frustrations I have of, obviously, people who simply, I think, try to put their head in the sand and ignore that there is an opinion. Sometimes we make a decision that if we are giving Homeland Security the ability of making these kinds of decisions on local communities, aren't we already doing that with the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture? Aren't they already making these arbitrary decisions on these local communities? Mr. Judd. They have, yes. Mr. Bishop. The difference is not significant, except that the difference is national security has an interest in those areas. The difference is the topography. So, that Tucson Sector is 80 percent controlled by the Federal Government, and almost half of that is in wilderness area. You don't find that along the Texas border. You don't find that in Maine or Montana. Mr. Judd. No, you don't. Mr. Bishop. What we need to do is make sure that we give flexibility for access. Access has to be critical. If the Border Patrol does not have access, we cannot do our job with security. It is not the same thing as a wall. But that access becomes significant, and our environmental laws inhibit that access from taking place. I yield back, in 1 second. Mr. Westerman. Great job. The gentleman yields back. There are several people still on the list to ask questions, so the Committee will stand in recess, and we will reconvene after votes. [Recess.] Mr. Westerman. The Committee will reconvene. I now recognize the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Gosar, for 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Gosar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Judd, regarding Border Patrol agents that are under scrutiny for sabotaging water stashes set up by humanitarian groups and coyotes, who are aiding the commission of criminal crimes, what is the procedure for Border Patrol agents who find humanitarian groups or supply stashes along and around the border? Mr. Judd. When you look at those pictures, what they are not telling you is why we would dispose of that water. If that water heats up in the desert, it is actually a lot more dangerous to drink extremely heated water than what it is if you don't have that water at all. So, what our agents are doing is they are actually taking a humanitarian effort to try to save these individuals. And it is on record to the extraordinary length that we have gone to save individuals, including an agent that went into the Colorado River and lost his life trying to save somebody who had crossed the border illegally. We have procedures in which we try our best to be as humanitarian to those that we come in contact with at all times. Mr. Gosar. Are the agents actively dismantling supplies for coyotes and individuals being smuggled? Mr. Judd. Absolutely not. Mr. Gosar. About how much of the waste and garbage throughout the borderlands comes from these humanitarian groups and the human and drug smugglers that they enable? Mr. Judd. A great deal. In fact, the vast majority of all the trash that is left in the desert is left from smugglers, the people that cross the border illegally, and from these humanitarian groups that leave these water jugs and these food piles around. Mr. Gosar. I have been to the border many times and have witnessed it firsthand. In your view, would Border Patrol agents benefit from a clear plan and procedure for combating supposed humanitarian groups that are aiding and abetting and smuggling environmental pollution in felony border crossings? Mr. Judd. Well, in fact, under the Obama administration, we were not able to enter into these camps to extricate these individuals that crossed the border illegally, even if we had the foot sign that clearly showed that illegal aliens were entering into these humanitarian camps. We know that these groups are helping people cross the border illegally, and that is just flat out against the law. If we are there to help for humanitarian purposes, that is perfect, but you can help through humanitarian purposes by reporting to the Border Patrol that people crossed the border illegally and let them know what hospital you are taking them to. But in reality, what they are doing is they are furthering the entrance of these individuals. Mr. Gosar. Well, to the law, they are aiding and abetting, right? Mr. Judd. They are. Mr. Gosar. OK. Mr. Nicol, you stated in your written testimony that there is no clear need to waive laws, environmental or otherwise, to facilitate Border Patrol activities. To make clear for the record, how many years of experience do you have in border security law enforcement? Mr. Nicol. As a law enforcement officer, none. Mr. Gosar. Really? Can you say that again for the record? Mr. Nicol. None. Mr. Gosar. Mr. Judd, in your decades of serving as a Border Patrol agent, do you agree with Mr. Nicol's statements that the 2006 MOU grants sufficient access to our agents to successfully deter illegal activity on the border? Mr. Judd. The way it is being implemented at this time, absolutely not. Mr. Gosar. Would there be any means to change that that you would find would suffice to actually work? Mr. Judd. No. It needs to be rewritten. Mr. Gosar. Thank you. Mr. Bell, your family has ranched land along the border for some 80 years. As someone who lives and works on the borderlands, your testimony included mention of violence, murder, and threats. Since the MOU was signed in 2006, have you seen these problems disappear? Mr. Bell. We have seen things get better on the border as far as that is concerned. When we see infrastructure come in along the border, we actually see conditions get better. We see interactions with illegal border crossers diminish. We don't see the drug smugglers as much. But there are those chance occasions when you run into somebody and you don't know who you are confronting, so---- Mr. Gosar. Can you give me a timeline? You have seen it get better, let's say around November of 2016 and since that time? Mr. Bell. Yes, I have seen it actually get better prior to that, actually. When they started to get these liaisons with the Forest Service in with the Border Patrol and actually work on projects to get roadways implemented on the border and infrastructure, like RVSS towers and IFT towers. Those were all done in coordination with the Forest Service. Mr. Gosar. So, has the deterrence been sufficient as Mr. Nicol would state? Mr. Bell. No. There is still a lot of smuggling going on in the area. There are still a lot of groups coming through the area. And in fact, they are using the areas where the agents have less capability of patrolling. Right now, the biggest area on our ranch where drugs are being smuggled is through the wilderness area. Mr. Gosar. Oh, absolutely. I thank the gentleman. My time has expired. I appreciate it. Mr. Westerman. The gentleman's time has expired. We will now move into a second round of questions, and I recognize myself for 5 minutes. Mr. Judd, can you clarify what types of challenges you have that you face in order to conduct maintenance on tactical infrastructure? This is infrastructure that is already in place. I know when I was at the border, we were in a vehicle, looked like it had new tires on it, but we spent part of the time changing a flat on the vehicle driving along the road that was on the border. Mr. Judd. The main issue that we have with maintenance, if we have a road, we can maintain that road, to answer Chairman Bishop's question. But the problem is, is we don't have north- south access roads that allow us to get to the border roads that allow us to maintain it in a timely fashion. To drive a road grader from, let's just say, the Naco or the Brian Terry Memorial Border Patrol Station to the Coronado National Forest, as opposed to driving that same road grader on the highway, taking it into the forest and then having that north-south access road, greatly diminishes the time. So, we have to have access to those roads. Mr. Westerman. And, Mr. Arthur, in Mr. Nicol's testimony he talked about the decrease in the amount of drugs coming over the southern border. Is that true? I thought there has actually been an increase in fentanyl and methamphetamine? Mr. Arthur. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you right now that the amount of fentanyl--and again, I cannot overstate the toxicity of this drug--the amount of fentanyl that we have seen has actually increased significantly month to month in the first 4 months of Fiscal Year 2018. It is almost as much as we saw in all of Fiscal Year 2017. Mr. Westerman. OK. And, Mr. Judd, recently when I traveled to the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector with Mr. Bishop, we witnessed the various effects of illicit border crossing activity. We were able to see firsthand how transnational criminal organizations utilize gaps in our border security to circumvent criminal operations. We saw these hideouts in the hills where the scouts operate from. And we know this can often lead to the creation of tunnels that are used for human trafficking and smuggling of narcotics. And I found out something else interesting when I was there, that the city of Nogales treats the sewage from Mexico and drugs actually get smuggled through the sewer system. Can you lead us through the steps your agents must take after the discovery of a cross-border tunnel and what it takes to remediate that tunnel or fill it in? Mr. Judd. Yes, it is a very difficult and lengthy process. We have to contact, again, as per the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, we have to contact several different agencies in order just to fill that tunnel in, which is what we are hoping to do. In remediating it, you are trying to take it back to its natural state. And it takes weeks, even months, to be able to take that tunnel back to its natural state because of the bureaucracy that is involved with these laws. Mr. Westerman. Mr. Nicol, a report on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge found almost 8,000 miles of ad hoc roads that were associated with illegal border crossings, and recommended Border Patrol be allowed to access the refuge and install tactical infrastructure. Since you believe the Border Patrol and security infrastructure are ineffective, what would you do to reduce the number of and the amount of damage that these unauthorized roads cause in the refuge? Mr. Nicol. Many of those roads are being created by east- west traffic, not just north-south traffic. One of the remediation efforts that has been undertaken at Cabeza Prieta and at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument has been to retire and repair unneeded roads, because those are used by smugglers the same way as they are used by Border Patrol agents. So, reducing the number of roads would not only help to remediate the damage, but it would also make it so that when you do have cross-border traffic, it is more concentrated in specific areas, which would in turn make it easier for Border Patrol to intercept. Mr. Westerman. Mr. Judd, you spent a lot of time in this area. Do you think these roads are mainly east-west or do you see north-south? The image we saw earlier looked like a vast web of ad hoc roads. Mr. Judd. The roads that Border Patrol agents use are east- west, but the roads that the smugglers use are all north-south. I mean, they might go east-west for a couple hundred yards until they go north-south again, but they are all north-south. Mr. Westerman. OK. My time has almost expired. I will now recognize Mr. Beyer for 5 minutes. Mr. Beyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. Mr. Chairman, we are here today to talk about the border wall while the Senate is talking about immigration legislation, so I think it is only fair that I take a few minutes to express my extreme disappointment with how disingenuous this immigration conversation has been in Congress. I think the American public is being spun, confused, misled by the President and Republican congressional leadership, so let me set the record straight. Number one, President Trump told us that Mexico would pay for the wall. Number two, Mr. Trump ended protection for Dreamers. Number three, now President Trump is insisting that we agree on his plan to limit immigration or else. Trump insists he is a dealmaker, but nothing could be further from the truth. He says he wants a bipartisan deal, but then he says he won't support any that are brought to him. He says Mexico will pay for the wall. Now, he is begging for us to fund it. He says he wants to protect Dreamers, but he won't do it unless Congress agrees to limit legal immigration. And he is holding immigration conversations hostage. This is reckless, period. The anti-immigrant right wants to build a border wall despite efforts that experts have said already decried because it doesn't make us any safer. And the anti-immigrant right wants to limit immigration, which is a fundamentally different conversation from anything that we have had before. No one was talking about this before because it is truly radical. Our economy needs immigration to be competitive and a lead. We need to protect our Dreamers, and nearly 80 percent of Americans and a vast majority of Republicans agree this must happen. We need to look at our high-skilled immigrants and per country caps, for example, House Bill H.R. 392. We need the American Hope Act, a meaningful bill for Dreamers, or my bill with Congressman Espaillat and Bonamici, the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, or Congresswoman Chu's Reuniting Families Act. We need meaningful discussion on temporary protective status. Congressman McGovern has a bill pushing this. We need meaningful treatment toward refugees, like Congressman Pascrell and Cicilline have been pushing. And we need meaningful access to health services, like Congresswoman Lujan Grisham has been advocating. But that is not our conversation. We are not being heard. The scared children and families are not being heard. Arguments about merit ignore that we already have merit in our system. Yes, it needs tweaks. The skills-based visa system is not perfect, but that is not the conversation we are having. Family reunification is now called chain migration, but we all understand the importance of family reunification. President Trump's own wife brought her parents here through that family reunification system. So, let's be real. Let's eliminate the coded language that tries to make us more comfortable with a nativist and even racist immigration policy. Look, we are all children, grandchildren, great grandchildren of immigrants, mostly when there were little or no immigration restrictions, and there were certainly no walls. Mr. Chairman, that is the end of my formal statement, but I do have a question or two. Mr. Nicol, in your testimony, you mention that the waiver to build roads and public lands is not only environmentally destructive, but can be counterproductive to border security efforts. We have heard a lot about the east-west walls needed just on the side. Can you give an example how the public roads could be counterproductive? Mr. Nicol. Probably the best documented example is in the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge. They are in an area that is very fissured and eroded and has deep crevices that someone cannot drive through. A patrol road was built along the southern edge of the refuge. That patrol road involved filling in lakes that are used by endangered fish. It didn't work very well because they got their bulldozers stuck when they tried to just dump dirt into it. But once the road was built, the refuge reported, in 2008, that that road was being used by smugglers, and that areas that previously had not seen any cross-border vehicle activity because one could not drive a vehicle through, were now being used by smugglers. There may well be other examples that have not been as well documented. That one, because you have land banners on the ground observing it, has been. Mr. Beyer. One more question. In Mr. Judd's written testimony, he described the need for some Border Patrol agents to use horses to patrol public lands as ``absurd.'' As someone who lives on the border, do you think it is absurd that the Border Patrol may need to use horses as transports in some cases? Mr. Nicol. For me? Mr. Beyer. Yes, Mr. Nicol. Mr. Nicol. Sure. I think that it makes a lot of sense in certain areas. It doesn't make sense to create a road when a horse is a more effective way to get across that terrain. There are some very rugged parts of the border where a horse is just the most appropriate and most effective way to get from point A to point B. Mr. Beyer. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Westerman. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Gosar, for 5 minutes. Mr. Gosar. Mr. Judd, Mr. Nicol made a comment about it is easier to pick up trash than building a wall. You are familiar with lower Santa Cruz, right? Mr. Nicol. I am, yes. Mr. Gosar. What happens in the lower Santa Cruz? Mexico is high ground. We are low ground in Arizona. So, what ends up happening, we get this episodic flooding, right? Mr. Judd. And we get a lot of trash washed into our areas. Mr. Gosar. Not just trash, but sewage, right? Mr. Judd. Yes, correct. Mr. Gosar. OK. Mr. Arthur, when we start looking at disease, I would talk about trash with disease, is the antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis advancing in the United States or receding? Mr. Arthur. I know that we have seen incidents of antibiotic tuberculosis in the United States. The source of it, I cannot actually identify, but I believe it is increasing. Mr. Gosar. Well, epidemiology-wise, in Arizona, it is moving farther north. OK? We have tons of illegals that come in, because we are one of the ones that actually have the treatments for that. So, where I am going with this is, the lower Santa Cruz, we made a comment about a wall. So, Mr. Judd, if we were to build a management of water with Mexico, would that actually be as good as a wall? Mr. Judd. I am sorry? Mr. Gosar. Like an infrastructure project where we actually mitigate the process and direct water along the mitigation, along the lower Santa Cruz. Mr. Judd. Absolutely. What we need to do is we need to be able to keep anything that is flowing from Mexico into the United States that could be bringing trash, sewage, or anything like that. And whether that is a wall, whether that is building an infrastructure with Mexico, we just need to be able to keep that out from the United States. Mr. Gosar. Let me ask you another question. Maybe you can't answer, but I have the answer. When you do something along the international border between Mexico, the United States, and Arizona, who helps pay for it? Mr. Judd. The United States does, as far as I know. Mr. Gosar. Can you say it? What is the other country south of us? Mr. Judd. I don't know very much that Mexico pays for anything. Mr. Gosar. No, but Mexico would pay for that on an infrastructure---- Mr. Judd. Oh, yes. In that case, yes. Mr. Gosar. Absolutely, so once again, President Trump said, ``no, Mexico would pay for it,'' well, this is a creative way of looking at something that actually mitigates trauma to our infrastructure aspects that both sides take care of. And it is even better than a wall. Mr. Judd. Yes. Mr. Gosar. We can actually extrapolate that to Nogales because of the wastewater problem. Once again, we have rampant sewage coming into the United States from Mexico. When we do the wastewater aspect, we are the low ground, they are high ground. So, we can actually mitigate this and it makes it something that both countries mitigate. Oh, by the way, let me ask you the question. There is also another tribe down there, right, the Tohono O'odham that are along that border as well? Mr. Judd. That is correct, yes. Mr. Gosar. So, this might be an interesting facade in regards to a mitigation on how we look at border security with an infrastructure project, would it not? Mr. Judd. It would, yes. Mr. Gosar. Wow. Interesting. But I guess I am the racist, because that is what was said here. It is disingenuous for my colleagues on the other side to say that. Over and over again, that is all I hear. You know what, there is an old analogy: ``Look in the mirror. The enemy is me.'' I yield back. Mr. Westerman. The gentleman yields back. We will do one more round of questioning. Mr. Arthur, you stated that you observed environmental concerns in your recent visit to the Rio Grande Valley Sector that hinders border security. Can you please explain the problems that agents face there? We have been talking about the Tucson Sector in Arizona, but let's look at some other areas along the border. Mr. Arthur. The main issue that I saw when I was down there was carrizo cane. Carrizo cane is an invasive species that grows along the banks of the Rio Grande River. And to quote The New Yorker, ``it forms a grassy forest along the border within which visibility is roughly 12 to 24 inches and makes an excellent hiding space.'' It is also a woody substance. It is very difficult to get through. Once smugglers, once any sort of cross-border traffic, enter that cane, it is next to impossible to find it. There are cane eradication projects, but the cane remains. And for some reason, nothing has been done. The curious thing is that when I stood on the bluffs of Roma, Texas, and I stared across the river at Ciudad Miguel Aleman, I believe it is, I actually saw Mexican workers cutting the cane on the other side of the border, when I looked down and I saw the cane growing along our own border. I don't know why we still have it. Mr. Westerman. Mr. Nicol, in your opening statement, you mentioned the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge as an example where border security infrastructure has failed. But you failed to note that Border Patrol's access to the refuge must be negotiated at the supervisor's level on a case-by-case basis. Do you think that if Border Patrol had more immediate access to the refuge's roads, it would deter illegal immigration and drug smugglers from using those roads? Mr. Nicol. I think that the interaction between the land management agencies and Border Patrol for any kind of interdiction efforts where they are both having jurisdiction is critical. Mr. Westerman. I want to change the format here just a little bit. We asked a lot of questions, but there may be something on your mind that you think the Committee needs to hear that we haven't asked. Mr. Bell, I want to start with you. Are there any other issues regarding border security, environmental laws, regulations and access that you think we need to hear? Mr. Bell. Well, it just doesn't stop with getting access to the border and waiving rules. We still need other things. We have to make sure there are boots on the ground. We have to make sure that we have aerial assets. We have to make sure they have the technology. All those things coupled together. But it doesn't stop there either. We need to make sure there is the infrastructure in place in the courts that allow for timely prosecutions and a judicial system that is willing to put out consequences. Only then can we really see a change if we impose consequences on folks. Mr. Westerman. Being from Arkansas and making a trip down to the border like I did recently, it was really eye-opening to me the vastness of the land there, the issues that the agents face, the obstacles that are in their way. Mr. Judd, I want to ask you, is there something else you think the Committee should know that would enhance the Border Patrol's ability to do their job in regards to rules and regulations and environmental policy that currently is on the books? Mr. Judd. Absolutely. I think that the main issue that we currently face is the access that we have to these public lands. Horse patrol is extremely important, and we always have to have horse patrol. But if we cannot respond in a timely manner to activity that is currently happening on the border, we are never going to be able to control the border and we are never going to be able to secure the border. Without that access, and without us being able to stop those people from entering into the country, we will never be able to secure the border. Mr. Westerman. Another thing I noticed there was that it is a system of protection with walls and roads and remote-sensing equipment. And access is a critical component of that. Even if you have a wall in a remote area, people could figure out how to breach that. And if you can't access it, you can't stop them. Mr. Arthur, do you have anything to add to that on anything the Committee should know that you haven't had a chance to tell us? Mr. Arthur. Absolutely. I would commend to the Committee Section 118, Division C, Title I of the Securing America's Future Act. It will respond to a lot of the issues that Agent Judd and Mr. Bell have raised today about Border Patrol agents having their hands tied. Basically, what it would do is it would waive a variety of laws in very critical situations when Border Patrol needs to get access and needs to provide crucial infrastructure along the border. In fact, I would expand it to include all laws so that state laws are not able to stop this critical work. Mr. Westerman. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Beyer for 5 minutes. Mr. Beyer. Thank you, Mr. Chair, very much. Mr. Nicol, I want to ask you about flooding. My friend Mr. Gosar talked about Nogales. There is the waiver authority in the border wall. What happened in 2008 in Nogales? Mr. Nicol. In 2008, seasonal monsoon rains that hit this area every 3 to 5 years came through Sonora and Nogales, Arizona. Rainfall that goes kind of from uphill in Mexico to downhill into the United States was dammed by the border wall that separates the two cities. In addition to the wall above ground, there had been a wall built below ground, without discussion with the International Boundary Water Commission, that backed up water that was going through the drainage culvert underneath and caused the road above to heave up so that water was flowing along the top and pouring out of the ground. Water on the Mexican side was about up to the door frames. On the U.S. side, it was ankle deep. Hundreds of buildings were damaged and two people drowned in Mexico. After that, there were efforts to retrofit border walls where they cross washes, but after that retrofitting occurred in 2011, water backed up behind a section of border wall in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a section that had been retrofitted. It then went over the top of the obstruction, carved out the foundation of the wall, and blew out a 60-foot wide section. We were told that that was an error and would not occur again, but in 2014 it occurred again, just outside of Nogales. Mr. Beyer. Would a NEPA analysis have made any difference in Organ Pipe National Monument or Nogales? Mr. Nicol. More than likely, because the land managers at Organ Pipe, before the wall went up, foresaw that walls were going to obstruct debris that would be going down awash during a flood. They actually commissioned a channel morphology report to be done as a baseline so they could see how it changed before the wall and after the wall. So, they saw it coming. Mr. Beyer. In my statement the last round, I complained about how candidate Trump and President Trump had promised that Mexico was going to pay for the wall. In his Fiscal Year 2019 budget we just got the other day, it has an $18 billion request for building the border wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, including 65 miles in the Rio Grande Valley. We all know that initial estimates tend to go way up. But my friend, Mr. Gosar, made some comment about how Mexico was actually paying. I was going to ask Congressman Gosar, but he left, anyone understand what he said and could explain that to me, how currently we are expecting Mexico to pay for this wall, or some parts of it? This is a friendly question. It would have been a friendly question for him. Mr. Arthur. If I could, Mr. Beyer, I believe that the statement had to do with levee walls being built on either side of the border. And if there were to be a levee on the United States side and a levee on the Mexican side, that, in fact, would be a border wall that Mexico would pay for. Mr. Beyer. OK. Do we anticipate that much of the remaining wall that has to be built along the Mexican border is going to be these parallel levees? Mr. Arthur. That I can't answer. But it actually goes exactly to the point that Mr. Nicol made, because what he was saying was, if you put a wall on one side and you don't have a wall on the other, you end up having a flood control problem. If you cure the flood control problem, you cure it on both sides, and that is one way that you would alleviate the problem. Mr. Beyer. But we are also depending on Mexico deciding that they have to build a wall on their side. Mr. Arthur. As I said, I was surprised to see the Mexicans--there seems to be this impression that the Mexicans don't care about border security. This is a real bread-and- butter issue for them because they don't want the gangs in their country either. That is why I saw them cutting the carrizo cane in Ciudad Miguel Aleman. They don't want this, so, quite frankly, it is possible that that could happen. Mr. Beyer. Thank you. Mr. Nicol, you talked about the Tohono O'odham Nation. It is a long history with the Border Patrol. Nevertheless, I understand that a waiver is used to construct a vehicle barrier across their land. Can you describe how that waiver affected the Tohono O'odham Nation? Mr. Nicol. They have complained that it has made it more difficult for them to interact with tribal members on both sides of the border. Their nation pre-exists the border being placed there. It restricts access to sacred sites and to family on the south of the border. And they have come out very strongly against converting that vehicle barrier into a pedestrian barrier as has been proposed. Mr. Beyer. OK. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you. Mr. Westerman. The gentleman yields back. I, again, want to thank all the witnesses for your valuable testimony, and the Members, to those that are still here, for our questions. The members of the Committee may have some additional questions for the witnesses, and we will ask you to respond to these in writing. Under Committee Rule 3(o), members of the Committee must submit witness questions within 3 business days following the hearing by 5:00 p.m., and the hearing record will be held open for 10 business days for their responses. In closing, I ask unanimous consent that the following items be entered into the record: A November 9, 2017, Congressional Research Service Report on Federal and Indian Lands on the U.S. Mexico Border.

[all]\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Washington, D.C.\nCenter for American Progress\n(Remarks as Prepared)\nThank you to John Podesta for that warm introduction. John is a good friend of mine, and I admire the work he’s done here at the Center for American Progress to advance the national debate on a range of important issues. John and I have worked together extensively, and I look forward to his continued partnership.\nIt’s not news to say that these are challenging times. From our first day in office, this new Administration was called on to meet an economic and financial crisis as deep and threatening as we’ve seen since the Great Depression. The President took bold and difficult steps to prevent the collapse of our financial system and reverse the ominous trends of negative growth and massive jobs loss.\nToday, thanks in no small part to the Recovery Act and other steps we have taken, the economy is growing again and job losses have slowed. But that progress is fragile, and we can’t let up until all the millions who are looking for work today can find it. Yet we know that surviving this storm isn’t enough if we fail to do the things we must to fortify America for the long run.\nThat’s why this Administration is taking on the critical challenges that have been ignored in Washington for too long. We are laying a new foundation for growth and prosperity that will strengthen the economy, families and small businesses throughout the country.\nBy tackling the issue of health insurance reform, we can bring new security and stability to families and businesses across the country. By planting the seeds of growth for a new, clean energy economy, we can open the door to the creation of millions of good jobs and secure America’s continued leadership in this new century. By making a serious, national commitment to education reform—which means college or technical training accessible to every young person willing to strive for it—we can insure their success, and America’s success, in a world where the best educated workers and workforce will win.\nSo even as we press to end this recession and get America back to work, we are determined to deal with long lingering problems that cloud our future. And another problem that has been punted from year to year, from Congress to Congress, from Administration to Administration, is the clear need for immigration reform.\nWe all know the story: A steady influx of undocumented workers, crossing our borders illegally in search of work and a better life. A market among employers willing to flout the law in order to hire cheap labor. And as a result, some 12 million people, here illegally, living in the shadows—a source of pain and conflict.\nIt is wrong. It’s an affront to every law-abiding citizen and every employer who plays by the rules.\nLike the Administration’s other priorities, when it comes to immigration, we are addressing a status quo that is simply unacceptable. Everybody recognizes that our current system isn’t working and that our immigration laws need to change. America’s businesses, workers, and faith-based organizations are calling for reform. Law enforcement and government at every level are asking for reform. And at the Department of Homeland Security, we need reform to do our job of enforcing the law and keeping our country secure.\nOver the past ten months, we’ve worked to improve immigration enforcement and border security within the current legal framework. But the more work we do, the more it becomes clear that the laws themselves need to be reformed.\nLet me be clear: when I talk about “immigration reform,” I’m referring to what I call the “three-legged stool” that includes a commitment to serious and effective enforcement, improved legal flows for families and workers, and a firm but fair way to deal with those who are already here. That’s the way that this problem has to be solved, because we need all three aspects to build a successful system. This approach has at its heart the conviction that we must demand responsibility and accountability from everyone involved in the system: immigrants, employers and government. And that begins with fair, reliable enforcement.\nWe know that one-sided reform, as we saw in 1986, cannot succeed. During that reform effort, the enforcement part of the equation was promised, but it didn’t materialize. That helped lead to our current situation, and it undermined Americans’ confidence in their government’s approach to this issue. That mistake can’t happen again, and it won’t happen again.\nThe American people expect us to act. Americans value our identity as both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. Unfortunately, too many politicians and pundits have treated these values as contradictory. They are not, and we will pursue reforms that emphasize both. The immigrant story is part of what it means to be an American – but failing to fix a broken system that undermines our shared values of lawfulness and fairness is not.\nThis is why key members of Congress are taking steps toward legislation that will create an immigration system that works. This is why the President continues to be fully committed to reforming our immigration laws, and why he asked me to take a lead role in this effort.\nWhat Has Changed Since 2007\nWhile everyone may agree that the status quo isn’t working, what everyone may not be aware of is how much the immigration landscape has changed since comprehensive reform efforts fell short in 2007. I’ve been dealing hands-on with immigration issues since 1993, so trust me: I know a major shift when I see one, and what I have seen makes reform far more attainable this time around.\nFor starters, the security of the Southwest border has been transformed from where it was in 2007. The federal government has dedicated unprecedented resources to the Mexican border in terms of manpower, technology and infrastructure—and it’s made a real difference.\nLast March, the Obama Administration announced a Southwest Border Initiative that has increased the resources the government is dedicating to combating drug cartels, and the smuggled cash and illegal weapons they thrive on. The Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense have dedicated unprecedented resources to this initiative. This includes additional inspection and surveillance technology, as well as hundreds of personnel specializing in fields like inspection, intelligence and prosecutions. At DHS, we started screening 100 percent of southbound rail shipments for illegal weapons and cash—for the first time ever.\nCompared to last year, seizures in all categories—drugs, smuggled cash, and illegal weapons—are up dramatically. For example, just looking at bulk cash, Customs and Border Protection has seized at the border more than $34 million in cash being smuggled southbound so far this year—more than four times as much as at this time last year.\nMoreover, the immigration debate in 2007 happened during a period of historically high levels of illegal entry into the United States. Two years later, because of better enforcement and the current economic circumstances, those numbers have fallen sharply. The flow has reduced significantly – by more than half from the busiest years, proving we are in a much different environment than we were before.\nThese are major differences that should change the immigration conversation. In 2007, many members of Congress said that they could support immigration reform in the future, but only if we first made significant progress securing the border. This reflected the real concern of many Americans that the government was not serious about enforcing the law. Fast-forward to today, and many of the benchmarks these members of Congress set in 2007 have been met. For example, the Border Patrol has increased its forces to more than 20,000 officers, and DHS has built more than 600 miles of border fencing. Both of these milestones demonstrate that we have gotten Congress’ message.\nWe’ve also shown that the government is serious and strategic in its approach to enforcement by making changes in how we enforce the law in the interior of the country and at worksites. We have replaced old policies that merely looked tough with policies that are designed to actually be effective.\nWe’ve revised and standardized our immigration-enforcement agreements with state and local law enforcement to make sure that these agencies are effective forcemultipliers in our efforts to apprehend dangerous criminal aliens. We’ve expanded the Secure Communities program, which identifies illegal aliens being booked into local jails. Yesterday, we marked the end of the first year for this program, which is being used by 95 jurisdictions and has identified more than 111,000 criminal aliens.\nFurthermore, we’ve transformed worksite enforcement to truly address the demand side of illegal immigration. We are auditing the books of thousands of employers suspected of relying on illegal labor to achieve an unfair advantage in the marketplace. As part of this effort, Immigration and Customs Enforcement audited more employers suspected of hiring illegal labor in a single day in July than had been audited in all of 2008. We’re also encouraging workplace compliance by expanding and improving the E-Verify system—an Internet-based system that allows participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of new hires. More than 167,000 employers at 639,000 worksites use E-Verify. In the past month, the program has grown at the rate of nearly 2,000 employers per week.\nImproved interior and worksite enforcement is a critical part of comprehensive immigration reform. We’ve demonstrated that when it comes to that issue, this Administration is committed to action.\nIn addition, recent improvements at managing the legal immigration system also prove that the federal government is ready to handle major reform.\nWe’ve ended a year-long backlog for background checks on applicants for green cards and naturalization. We’ve expanded the opportunity for a widow to gain legal status here, despite the untimely death of her U.S. citizen spouse. We’ve launched a new interactive website that allows people to receive information about the status of their immigration cases by e-mail or text message, and we have reduced the time it takes to process those cases.\nIn addition to these changes, since 2007 we have made significant strides in technology. For example, new biometric technology allows us to take the fingerprints of people coming into the United States and compare their prints against databases we couldn’t access before. This means we have new and enhanced abilities to quickly identify people committing immigration fraud, either by using someone else’s documents or by forging documents to escape detection for a past crime or immigration violation. We also have enhanced our capacity to exclude those suspected of supporting terrorism or other serious international crimes before they enter our country.\nOverall, these and other changes make comprehensive immigration reform more attainable as a matter of both politics and policy. At the border, in the interior of the country, and when it comes to legal immigration, the government has made significant strides to improve enforcement. This is a fundamental change from 2007.\nHere’s the other thing that has shifted in this debate: a larger segment of the American public has embraced the need to engage this debate and arrive at a sensible solution to this problem. CAP has helped to document this shift.\nThere are leaders of the law enforcement community speaking out, saying that immigration reform is vital to their ability to do their jobs keeping Americans safe. Faith leaders, including the National Association of Evangelicals, have announced their support for immigration reform as a moral and practical issue. We are seeing more business leaders and more labor leaders engaged in this debate in a constructive way than we have ever seen before.\nThese constituencies have all arrived at the same conclusion that prevails among the American people: this is a problem that needs to be fixed—and the best way to ensure that we can uphold our laws is to make sure our laws are rational and enforceable.\nWhy DHS Needs Immigration Reform\nThat reality is apparent to us at DHS. Over the past year, as this Administration has pursued more effective strategies within the current laws, the picture of how exactly those laws need to be changed has become clearer than ever before. In the past ten months, we have made tough choices, and implemented significant reforms within the current legal framework—but they are not enough to create the system that we want or that we need. If we are truly going to fix a broken system, Congress will have to act.\nWhen it comes to immigration, I took an oath as Secretary of Homeland Security to secure the nation by enforcing the law and managing legal flows across the border. Let me be clear: to do this job as effectively as possible, DHS needs immigration reform.\nReform legislation would provide lasting and dedicated resources at our borders, and provide some critical legal tools that we don’t currently have to combat smuggling organizations. For example, we need tougher anti-smuggling laws in dealing with the aggravated crimes smugglers commit—including assaulting law enforcement officers, endangering children, threatening relatives and abandoning people in the desert— hundreds of whom succumb to death from heat and lack of water. We also need to update current laws that don’t cover some of the new means by which criminals conduct their business. For instance, today’s smugglers and drug traffickers often move cash through “stored value” cards, which aren’t even considered monetary instruments under the current money-smuggling laws.\nIn addition, we need improvements to the current law when it comes to interior and worksite enforcement. Dishonest businesses often ignore the civil fines for illegal employment now on the books because they’re so low. It’s also very difficult to prosecute these crimes as felonies because of the over-elaborate intent requirements built into the current statutes.\nMoreover, some current laws covering immigration-related fraud have to be brought more in line with common sense. Right now, a corrupt immigration attorney who facilitates hundreds of immigration violations by knowingly helping aliens fraudulently seek asylum or permanent residence is treated almost the same as an alien who buys a single fake green card.\nOn top of this, in order to have fully effective law enforcement, we need Congress to create the legal foundation for bringing the millions of illegal immigrants in this country out of the shadows, require them to register and pay all taxes they owe, and enforce the penalties that they will have to pay as part of earning legal status. Let me emphasize this: we will never have fully effective law enforcement or national security as long as so many millions remain in the shadows.\nMaking sure these people become full taxpayers and pay their fair share will both benefit our economy and make it easier to enforce the laws against unscrupulous or exploitive employers. A tough and fair pathway to earned legal status will mandate that illegal immigrants meet a number of requirements—including registering, paying a fine, passing a criminal background check, fully paying all taxes and learning English.\nThese are substantial requirements that will make sure this population gets right with the law. It will help fix our broken system.\nThe Broad Need for Reform\nWhile it’s important to emphasize the need for immigration reform from an enforcement perspective, the need for reform stretches far beyond those reasons. We have to make sure the immigration system works to support American families, businesses and workers.\nAs part of the Administration’s outreach on this issue, my Department has held stakeholder meetings with more than 1,000 people and organizations across the country. The businesses, community leaders, labor leaders, faith groups and law enforcement we’ve met with all have different stories, but they all reach the same conclusion: we need reform. This reform will be part of the new foundation for growth, prosperity, and security that this Administration is working to create.\nOur system must be strong enough to prevent illegal entry and to get criminal aliens off our streets and out of the country. But it must also be smart enough to reward the hard work and entrepreneurial spirit that immigrants have always brought to America—traits that have built our nation.\nRequiring illegal immigrants to register to earn legal status, as I discussed earlier, will strengthen our economy as these immigrants become full-paying taxpayers. As labor leaders have made clear to me, immigration reform will be a boon to American workers. Think about it: unions will never achieve the best terms for workers when a large part of the workforce is illegal and operates in a shadow economy. By contrast, the status quo not only hurts American workers, it also stifles potential opportunities to grow our economy.\nA few months ago, I held a forum where I heard from technology executives in Silicon Valley, our country’s center of technological innovation. They told me that they want to increase their workforce and help get the economy moving again, but some of the major barriers they have to growing their companies are visa laws that make it difficult for high-skilled foreigners to stay here to work. Today, we have a system where America educates many of the brightest individuals from around the world, and then tells them to leave the country when many of them would rather start their own ventures or strengthen businesses right here in America. This hurts the economy for all of us, and it has to change.\nGoing forward, our visa policies must work for every sector of our economy, and across the income scale. In my meetings, leaders in agriculture, service industries and other fields have told me that current visa policies are hindering the growth of businesses looking to expand. To address this economic need, we need carefully crafted programs that allow American businesses to hire needed foreign workers while protecting the labor and health-and-safety rights of all workers. We need to revise our current provisions for legal migration to help assure a legal workforce in cases where businesses can’t find Americans to fill their jobs. These changes will make our economy stronger and more prosperous at all levels.\nCommunity and faith leaders have also emphasized to me that we need reform because of how difficult the current laws can be on families, especially families of mixed legal status. Our immigration system is outdated where families are concerned, and we need to modernize and streamline the laws governing this process.\nNo one should have to wait in a line for years in order to reunite with a spouse or a young child. And we must protect the families of our men and women in the armed forces, some of whom volunteer to serve this country before they even become naturalized citizens. These individuals risk their lives to ensure the safety of all Americans. We have a duty to ensure that their families are treated with dignity when their soldiers return from combat.\nI have had the honor of administering the oath of citizenship to active-duty personnel who had been serving our country long before I swore them in. These men and women are a reminder, as the President told them on the day of their swearing-in, that America is not just “a collection of rights,” but also “a set of responsibilities...it depends on each of us doing our part.”\nConclusion\nSo we all have to do our part to have a system that works. At the end of the day, when it comes to immigration, people need to be able to trust the system. Americans need to know that their government is committed to enforcing the law and securing the border—and that it takes this responsibility seriously. Law enforcement needs to have better legal tools and the necessary resources to deal with border-related and immigration-related crime. Businesses must be able find the workers they need here in America, rather than having to move overseas. Immigrants need to be able to plan their lives—they need to know that once we reform the laws, we’re going to have a system that works, and that the contours of our immigration laws will last. And they need to know that they will have as many responsibilities as they do rights.\nThe President is committed to this issue because the need for immigration reform is so clear. This Administration does not shy away from taking on the big challenges of the 21st century, challenges that have been ignored too long and hurt our families and businesses. When Congress is ready to act, we will be ready to support them.\nAs I said earlier, we are both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. This is ingrained in our national character and it has helped make America the great nation that it is. But we must modernize our laws for the 21st century so that this vision can endure. This is a task that is critical, that is attainable, and that we are fully committed to fulfilling.\nThank you.\n###\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The timeline below features significant historical events for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.\nSelect a date in the timeline bar to quickly move to specific eras or decades.\nApril 30, 1789\nGeorge Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States on the balcony of the First Federal Hall in New York which served as the seat of the federal government until 1790, when the capital was moved to Philadelphia.

These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

They also targeted 76 email addresses on the domain used by the Clinton campaign, though the exact timing of both of those efforts is unclear. Earlier that month, the FBI announced it would not recommend charges against Clinton for her use of a personal email server during her time as secretary of state. Clinton sent about 60,000 emails during her time in the Obama administration, but the FBI did not have access to all of them; her staff deleted about half because they were private. The “missing emails” became a frequent point of attack for Trump and Republicans in the runup to the 2016 election. After the July, 2016 news conference, critics slammed Trump for apparently encouraging foreign actors to steal information from his opponent. “This has gone from being a matter of curiosity and a matter of politics to being a national security issue,” the Clinton campaign said in a statement after Trump’s remarks.

There is irrefutable evidence detailing how President Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an Intelligence Community Assessment that they knew was false, promoting the contrived narrative that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help President Trump win, as though it were true. The documents we released shows how they did it: manufacturing findings from shoddy sources, suppressing evidence that disproved their false claims, disobeying IC tradecraft standards, and withholding the truth from the American people,” said DNI Gabbard. “In doing so, they conspired to subvert the will of the American people and worked with their partners in the media to promote this lie to undermine the legitimacy of President Trump. This kicked off what would essentially be a yearslong coup against President Trump which included federal investigations, two impeachments, FBI raids on his home, arrests of senior officials, smears and harassment of President Trump and his family, and more. The American people deserve the truth, accountability and justice. The integrity, and therefore the future of our democratic republic demands it.”\nBelow are key findings from the HPSCI oversight report:\n- Putin’s principal interests relating to the 2016 election were to undermine faith in the US democratic process, not showing any preference of a certain candidate.\n- Putin chose not to leak the most damaging and compromising material on Hillary Clinton prior to the election; instead planning to release it after the election to weaken what Moscow viewed would be an inevitable Clinton presidency. If Russia wanted to help Donald Trump get elected, they would have released this material prior to the election to harm the Clinton campaign.\n- The material about Hilliary Clinton that Putin chose not to release before the election, included possible criminal acts, including:\n- “Details of secret meetings with multiple named US religious organizations, in which State Department representatives offered – in exchange for supporting Secretary Clinton – “significant increases in financing” from Department funds and “the patronage” of State in dealing with ‘post-Soviet countries.”\n- DNC emails detailing that Hillary Clinton suffered from “psycho-emotional problems,” “uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression, and cheerfulness.” Clinton was allegedly on a daily regimen of “heavy tranquilizers,” and while she was afraid of losing, she remained “obsessed with a thirst for power.”\n- CIA Director Brennan and the IC mischaracterized intelligence and relied on dubious, “substandard” sources to create a contrived false narrative that Putin developed “a clear preference” for Trump.\n- CIA Director Brennan and the IC misled lawmakers by referencing the debunked Steele Dossier to assess “Russian plans and intentions,” which falsely suggested the dossier had intelligence value.\n- The IC excluded “significant intelligence” and “ignored or selectively quoted” reliable intelligence that contradicted the ICA’s key findings on Putin’s alleged support for Trump, that if included, would have exposed the ICA’s claim was “implausible—if not ridiculous.”\n- The ICA omitted reliably sourced information, such as how some Russian intelligence officials were “planning for candidate Clinton’s victory” while others assessed “neither Trump nor Clinton” would respect Russian interests.\nAs reflected in ODNI documents released on July 18, multiple IC assessments released in the months leading up to the November 2016 elections assessed that Russia had neither the intent nor capability to impact the outcome of the US election.\n- On December 5, 2016, the FBI and ODNI gave HPSCI its first post-election classified briefing, in which there was “no mention of Putin ‘aspiring’ to elect Trump” by either agency.\n- The President’s Daily Brief (PDB) drafted on December 8, 2016 stated that no Russian or criminal actors impacted vote counts. This document was pulled hours before it was to be published due to “new guidance.” If it had been published, it would have been briefed to both President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump.\n- On December 9, 2016, a National Security Council meeting was called with President Obama’s senior national security officials, which included CIA Director John Brennan, DNI James Clapper, Susan Rice, Andrew McCabe and others.\n- After the December 9, 2016 secret meeting of Obama national security officials, DNI Clapper’s assistant sent an email to leaders in the IC with the subject line “POTUS tasking on Russia Election Meddling,” and tasking to create a new “assessment per the President’s request.”\n- The HPSCI oversight report reveals that, “unlike routine IC analysis, the ICA was a high-profile product ordered by the President, directed by senior IC agency heads, and created by just five analysts, using one principal drafter. Production of the ICA was subject to unusual directives from the President and senior political appointees, and particularly DCIA.”\n- Later that same day, Brennan ordered the inclusion of “substandard reporting” on Russian activities, which had previously been withheld from publication because the information was judged “to have not met longstanding publication standards.” Some of the information was, later used in the ICA, over the objections of veteran CIA officers, because it was “unclear, or from unknown subsources.”\n- CIA Director Brennan overruled senior CIA officers who challenged the ICA’s claims, stating “we don’t have direct information that Putin wanted to get Trump elected.\n- Yet, the Obama-directed ICA published on January 6, 2017 explicitly stated: “We assess Putin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.” The CIA and FBI expressed high confidence in this judgment, while the NSA held moderate confidence.\n- However, the HPSCI report reveals “the ICA did not cite any report where Putin directly indicated helping Trump win was the objective.”\nSteele Dossier\nWe now know one of the source documents the Obama Administration officials used in the creation of the January 2017 ICA was the discredited, unverified Steele Dossier.\n- HPSCI report states: “Contradicting public claims by the DCIA [Brennan] that the dossier ‘was not in any way’ incorporated into the ICA, the dossier was referenced in the ICA main body text and further detailed in a two-page ICA annex.”\nJohn Brennan lied and denied using the dossier in the ICA because he knew it was a discredited, politically motivated manufactured document. He told senior CIA officials to use it anyway.\n- CIA officer to HPSCI staff: “DCIA [Brennan] refused to remove it, and when confronted with the dossier’s main flaws, [Brennan] responded, ‘Yes, but doesn’t it ring true?’”\nThe bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) report (Volume 5, 2020) also criticized the FBI’s handling of the Steele Dossier, noting its completely unverified nature and purposeful sidestepping of IC procedure in its use.\n“High Confidence”\nPresident Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey and others, along with their mouthpieces in the media, knowingly lied as they repeated the contrived false narrative they created in the January 2017 ICA with “high confidence” as though it were fact.\n- Obama’s CIA Director, Brennan stated in a memo to agency staff in December 2016, “There is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election.”\n- Obama’s Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper was tasked with overseeing the creation of the January 2017 ICA and expressed confidence in its findings. In a 2018 interview with the Harvard Gazette, he said, “We provided Trump the same classified assessment that President Obama received,” which included the high-confidence judgment that “Putin directly ordered the hacking and election interference.” Clapper further noted, “I think they [Russians] actually influenced the outcome,” indicating his personal belief in the ICA’s conclusions.\nThe HPSCI report was updated several times as the Committee received new information, with the most recent version dated September 2020.\nThe report from today’s release is available on DNI.gov. DNI Gabbard will post updates on X (@DNIGabbard) and Truth Social (@DNlTulsiGabbard).\n###\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Executive Summary\nThe City’s fiscal outlook differs significantly from that depicted in the Preliminary Budget and Financial Plan released by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on January 12, for three main reasons.\nFirst, on February 17 the City and DC 37 announced a tentative contract agreement. The January Financial Plan funded raises of 1.25 percent per year for four years. The DC 37 agreement includes four annual raises of 3 percent, a fifth yearly raise of 3.25 percent, and a signing bonus of $3,000. The raises do not appear to be offset by savings or productivity increases. If this were to be pattern for all other unions, it would add costs of $2.5 billion in FY 2023, $1.8 billion in FY 2024, $3.4 billion in FY 2025, $3.9 billion in FY 2026, and $4.7 billion in FY 2027 for a total of $16.3 billion.\nSecond, the cost for shelter and services provided to asylum seekers is escalating. The January Financial Plan assumed the annual cost to be $1 billion in FY 2023 and zero in FY 2024 and beyond, and also assumed these costs would be covered in full by Federal aid. By February 7, City Hall had projected the cumulative cost for FY 2023 and FY 2024 would be $4.2 billion. State and Federal aid are currently projected to cover only one-quarter of that.\nThird, the NY State Executive Budget, while providing partial funding for the cost of sheltering asylum seekers and an increase in school funding, also includes $1 billion in cost shifts, unfunded mandates, and revenue cuts just in FY 2024. Additional, significant costs could derive from the Governor’s proposals regarding charter schools. Finally, the cost of implementing the State’s class size mandate legislation enacted in 2022, which requires the City to reduce class size in its schools over the next five years, remains unfunded.\nThis report also incorporates an updated forecast of economic conditions and City revenues. The forecast reflects the economic resiliency in response to tighter monetary policy shown so far, and an outlook predicated on a successful economic “soft-landing.” In this scenario, the national and New York City economies slow down but avoid a recession. The analysis also incorporates up-to-date information on the City’s property tax, which is not included in the Financial Plan. The Office of the Comptroller’s projection of City revenues exceeds OMB’s by $1.38 billion in FY 2023, $2.32 billion in FY 2024, $1.90 billion in FY 2025, $2.19 billion in FY 2026, and $3.61 billion in FY 2027.\nDespite the revised revenue projection, budget gaps are estimated at $1.30 billion in FY 2023 and $1.51 billion in FY 2024. Gaps swell to $7.07 billion in FY 2025, $10.22 billion in FY 2026 and $11.66 billion in FY 2027. These gaps do not include the risk deriving from the cost of services provided to asylum seekers: $823 million in FY 2023, $2.18 billion in FY 2024, and, potentially, $2.8 billion each year thereafter. The gaps also do not incorporate the fiscal impact of the Governor’s executive budget, of the Governor’s proposals regarding charter schools, and of class size legislation.\nIn FY 2023, the City has access to $1.8 billion in the General Reserve and Capital Stabilization Reserve, and the Mayor’s Executive Budget later this spring will include additional savings and resources to balance the FY 2024 budget. However, the full extent of the measures needed will depend on the cost and funding for the services provided to asylum seekers, and on the enacted State budget. In the outyears, the size of the budget gaps indicates the need of structural interventions on both expenses and revenues.\nThe FY 2024 Preliminary Budget & January 2023 Financial Plan\nThe FY 2024 Preliminary Budget totals $102.66 billion, reflecting a continued drop in spending with the ramping down of COVID-19 federal grant-related spending. The budget gap of $2.89 billion in the November Plan was resolved in the Preliminary Budget through a combination of revenue increases, and a pre-payment of $1.46 billion from FY 2023 to FY 2024.\nThe FY 2024 Preliminary Budget reflects the culmination of both the November Plan’s and the January Plan’s Program to Eliminate the Gap (PEG), for a total of $1.95 billion of savings. These savings programs resulted in a reduction of 4,374 City-funded positions.\nThe Comptroller’s Office anticipates overall tax revenues and miscellaneous revenues to come in higher than the City’s projections in each year of the Financial Plan. All categories of tax revenue are forecasted to come in higher than planned in FY 2023 and FY 2024. The Comptroller’s Office forecast for Property Tax Revenue grows significantly higher than the Plan in the outyears. All other tax revenues are projected to be higher than OMB’s forecast in each year, except Business Taxes and Real Estate Transaction taxes which begin to fall below OMB’s forecast in FY 2025 and FY 2026 respectively. In total, this report projects that revenues will be higher than OMB’s projections by $1.38 billion in FY 2023, $2.23 billion in FY 2024, $1.9 billion in FY 2025, $2.19 billion in FY 2026, and $3.61 billion in FY 2027.\nOffsetting these higher revenues are a number of known and unknown expenses that are not yet included in OMB’s financial plan.\nIf, as noted above, labor contracts with all unions follow the same pattern as the recent agreement with DC 37, the City would face additional costs of $2.5 billion in FY 2023, $1.8 billion in FY 2024, $3.4 billion in FY 2025, $3.9 billion in FY 2026, and $4.7 billion in FY 2027.\nThe Comptroller’s Office is also including a variety of risks within the Department of Education’s budget. In addition to risks that this office has previously included, primarily for the exhaustion of federal stimulus funds and the chronic underbudgeting for Carter cases, pupil transportation, and charter school tuition, an additional risk is included for the class size mandates imposed by the State last year. The City is estimating the cost of implementing smaller class sizes will cost $1.3 billion once fully implemented ($433 million in FY 2026 and $867 million in FY 2027).\nOther risks include additional underbudgeting within the City’s ongoing support of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and elevated temporary and overtime expenses compared to the budget.\nOverall, the Comptroller’s estimated additional expense risk is $2.68 billion in FY 2023, $3.83 billion in FY 2024, $5.81 billion in FY 2025, $7.40 billion in FY 2026, and $8.80 billion in FY 2027. Combined with the revenue offsets above, the net risk, not yet incorporated into the Financial Plan, is $1.30 billion in FY 2023, $1.51 billion in FY 2024, $3.90 billion in FY 2025, $5.21 billion in FY 2026, and $5.20 billion in FY 2027.\nIt is with far less certainty that we layer in the possible expense of the asylum seekers on the five years of the Financial Plan. The January 2023 Financial Plan did not alter the November Plan addition of $1 billion of expense in FY 2023, with full Federal reimbursement. OMB has since stated that they expect the FY 2023 expenses to grow to $1.4 billion at current levels of growth till the end of the year, and the FY 2024 expenses would annualize to $2.8 billion. While OMB’s estimates do not extend beyond FY 2024, it is very likely that many of these expenses will continue in the outyears and possibly at even higher levels. Expected Federal and State assistance would only provide partial support, leaving a large portion of these costs to be borne by the City.\nIn addition, the Governor’s Executive Budget includes a number of other items that would directly impact the City’s budget, if enacted. While record-level school aid was driven by the first ever full funding of the State’s Foundation Aid formula, the City is set to receive only 21 percent of the historic $2.73 billion increase. Other significant proposals include raising the City’s contributions to the transit system by over $500 million per year and intercepting the Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (eFMAP), that NYC and other localities across the State use to offset their share of Medicaid costs. These cost shifts and unfunded mandates would cost the City $1 billion in FY 2024 and grow to $2.3 billion if the charter cap is removed and the full number of allowable charter schools are implemented. If enacted, these changes would significantly widen the City’s budget gap.\nCapital Budget & Financing\nThe January 2023 Capital Commitment Plan totals $96.55 billion in all-funds authorized commitments for FY 2023 – FY 2027, a $551.2 million (0.6 percent) increase compared to the September 2022 Capital Plan over the same fiscal years. The major increases are in projects related to water pollution control, sanitation, and citywide equipment, resiliency, and energy efficiency.\nThe City also released its required Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy, which totals $159.33 billion for FY 2024 – FY 2033. This is an increase of $25.59 billion (19.1 percent), from the last Ten-Year Capital Strategy published in April 2021. The categories with the largest changes are the Department of Transportation with an increase of $8.43 billion, housing (HPD and NYCHA) with an increase of $7.92 billion, Department of Environmental Protection, with an increase of $6.38 billion, and the Parks Department with an increase of $3.13 billion. Offsetting these increases, is a projected decrease of $4.80 billion in Education/CUNY related projects.\nTotal projected borrowing in the January 2023 Financial Plan for FY 2023 through FY 2027 is $62.35 billion.\nTable 1.

The City’s Economic Outlook\nEconomic Forecast, 2023 – 2027[1]\nThe U.S. economy lingers at an important crossroads with the most disruptive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic already in the rear-view mirror, but also the sunsetting of the unprecedented and largely successful government-led economic responses financed mainly by Federal deficits. High inflation has been the bee in the bonnet of an otherwise strong national recovery from the pandemic’s low points, and the Federal Reserve has recently taken firm steps to demonstrate that they are watching it closely and are willing and able to respond to what the latest price data tell them.\nMany economic forecasters are still expecting a significant growth slowdown in 2023, despite upbeat recent data describing economic and job growth. So far unbothered by the Fed’s contractionary policy over the past year, labor markets remain very tight with U.S. unemployment at 3.4 percent, near a historic low point. Thus, markets and many forecasters took the surprisingly strong jobs report in January to be a bad piece of news—projecting that the swift pace of hiring will further widen the gap between labor demand and supply…which should drive up wages…which in turn likely increases prices…which motivates the Fed to push harder on their economic brakes.\nLabor markets in NYC are arguably less tight than the U.S. nationally, with a higher unemployment rate of 5.9 percent in the city and, in New York statewide data, a recently dropping ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. Nonetheless, the city’s economy remains vulnerable to national economic trends in monetary policy, especially in the financial, technology and professional services sectors that form an important core of local income, spending, and tax bases. The technology and securities sectors in New York City are likely to experience both job and income loss in 2023 because of profit and market declines that have already occurred.\nBut while there may be a near-term slowdown, the forecast for the city and the nation beginning in 2024 looks brighter. The Comptroller’s forecast assumes that the Fed is relatively successful in guiding the economy through a “soft landing,” lowering inflation without creating a recession or significantly high unemployment. Most sectors in the NYC economy have already substantially caught up to their pre-pandemic levels of operation, and therefore it is likely that, after a one-year pause, most economic measures will resume patterns of growth typical of pre-pandemic years.\nTable 5 summarizes the economic forecasts of the Office of the NYC Comptroller and the Mayor’s Office.\nTable 5.

This growth occurred amidst a continued contractionary monetary policy instituted by the Federal Reserve. The Fed Funds Rate began 2022 at 0.1 percent, had risen to 1.6 percent by the beginning of July and finished the year at 4.3 percent.\nMeanwhile, once-hot inflation began to slow over the course of the year. Year-over-year inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell to 6.4 percent in January 2023, down from its peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022. Although the overall index has been trending down the last six months, the energy and the food indexes remain elevated, at year over year increases of 8.7 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively, in January 2023.\nThe deceleration in price growth can be attributed to several factors. The Fed can probably enjoy some of the credit for the slowdown—not because of its impact on the economy, which hasn’t cooled off, but by lowering future inflationary expectations that are always a major driver of price spirals. Another factor was the gradual adoption of resilience strategies by many businesses facing new supply-chain bottlenecks that initially had fueled shortage-related price hikes. In addition, energy prices declined from their spring and summer highs that were sparked by Russia’s war against Ukraine. Lastly, the effects of pandemic-response stimulus financed by Federal deficit spending began to wind down in 2022, removing a temporary fuel for additional consumer demand and a possible inhibitor of labor supply.\nBut it is the tight labor market that has inflation hawks worried right now. The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent in January 2023—its lowest rate since 1969. In December, the number of job openings per unemployed worker was 1.8, while the quits rate was at an elevated 2.7 percent. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 517,000 jobs added to U.S. payrolls in January. And while that month’s total may have been beefed-up by unseasonably warm temperatures across the country, payrolls have been consistently increasing at a good clip for the past several months. With labor markets unresponsive to monetary actions so far, the Fed will likely be watching to see if the imbalance between high labor demand and low labor supply can clear without significant wage inflation.\nA key question is whether the Fed can thread the needle, lowering inflation to their target of 2 percent without pushing the economy into recession. This “soft landing” scenario probably requires that some visible signs of a loosening labor market occur soon. Debt markets appear to expect the recession option. Treasury yield curves are more sharply inverted than at any time since 1981, with 2-year rates currently more than 0.8 percent above 10-year rates. Such inversions usually reflect a strong expectation of a recession, when policy rates are almost always lowered to stimulate the economy into recovery. The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points early in February (0.25 percent) to a range of 4.5-4.75 percent. Recent statements by the Fed Chairman indicate that rates may rise higher than 5.0 percent in 2023 if wage growth and inflation figures do not show decelerating prices.\nThe Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has predicted a significant slowdown in U.S. economic growth in calendar year 2023 (a 0.3 percent increase in real GDP) but does not expect the economy to go all the way into a recession. Higher growth resumes in their forecast beginning in 2024, although they do not project growth above 2.0 percent any year during the Plan window (through 2027). While noting that monetary policy often works with a lag, they expect that inflation drops by 2024 all the way down to 2.3 percent, close to the Fed target. Their unemployment rate forecast peaks at 5.0 percent in 2024. Overall, their medium-term view expects that inflation will subside quickly without long-lasting economic hardships.\nThe Office of the NYC Comptroller’s forecast for the U.S. economy projects much less slowing in 2023, with forecast GDP growth of 1.3 percent. Our projected growth rates in years 2024-27 are also higher than OMB’s and closer to long-run average growth rates in non-recessionary years. But aside from differing GDP growth rates, our U.S. economic forecast is quite similar to OMB’s in that we forecast inflation to subside by 2024 without a recession or a significant spike in unemployment.\nThe New York City Economy\nEmployment\nPrivate sector employment in New York City currently stands at 4.02 million, 97.9 percent of its pre-pandemic level. The city added more than 199,000 private sector jobs in 2022, a 5.2 percent annual growth rate and a pace of roughly 17,000 per month (see Table 6). The extent of recovery from pandemic job losses varies by industry sector. The sectors experiencing the most recent job growth in the city are health care and social assistance (adding 18,000 jobs in the fourth quarter of 2022) and food and hospitality (14,000). Together, these two categories accounted for roughly three-fourths of 4th-quarter growth in private payroll employment, and more than half of the growth seen throughout 2022 (See Chart 1).\nTable 6.

Office-based sectors, with relatively high average wages, did not cut payrolls as much as many other industries when the pandemic hit, and they have also grown since that time. At the same time, the food and hospitality sector, with lower-than-average wages, suffered the largest payroll contraction and even with strong 2022 growth job counts remain 13 percent below February 2020. The tourism portion of the food and hospitality industry may now have nearly fully recovered from the pandemic, and we project that the rate of job growth in the sector will slow down. However, it may take more than a few years for jobs in this entire sector to approach their pre-pandemic levels, as business travel to NYC is not expected to return as quickly or as completely as tourism.\nChart 2. NYC Employment Relative to Pre-Pandemic (February 2020) Levels\nSOURCE: New York State Department of Labor, NYC Office of Management and Budget\nRetail employment—which is also relatively low-paying on average—fell substantially in 2020 and has had more difficulty coming back in 2022, declining in the 4th quarter and still 13 percent below its pre-pandemic level. Employment in NYC retail trade was already shrinking in the years prior to the pandemic (at an annual rate of -1.7 percent in 2015-19) and the lockdowns, closures and enhanced unemployment benefits may have accelerated a trend already in motion. In addition, the now seemingly long-term reduction in the number of office workers in central business districts on weekdays will reduce the volume of retail trade in those areas—although some of this loss will presumably be offset by retail expansion in other areas. We project that the retail sector will not recover the remaining jobs it lost during the pandemic.\nWe anticipate near-term job losses in the securities industry, a very high-wage sector in New York City. Profits for NYC securities firms, driven down by a bear market and the erosion of interest rate spreads, declined by 60 percent in 2022 and we project a further decline in 2023. We forecast that the industry will shed close to 4,000 jobs in 2023, with an additional 3,000 in 2024 and 2025, for a cumulative total of 4 percent of that sector’s workforce. And we do not expect these jobs to rebound within the next five years. As Chart 3 demonstrates, in each of the two prior bear markets, Wall Street shed jobs and did not bring them back quickly. It can also be seen in this chart that the current down cycle, unlike the prior two, was not preceded by as large a buildup of hiring and therefore we do not expect employment to drop as dramatically as in the past.\nChart 3. History of Declines in NYC Securities Employment\nSOURCE: New York State Department of Labor, New York City Office of Management and Budget, Office of the New York City Comptroller\nThe Comptroller’s forecast also anticipates a falloff in technology sector jobs in 2023. The sector has thus far added to its NYC payroll count over and above its pre-pandemic level. Eroding profits and share prices at many major technology companies have led many to announce layoffs and cost-cutting initiatives.[2] Our forecast calls for the sector to lose more than 9,000 jobs in 2023, approximately half of its post-COVID job gain over pre-COVID levels.[3]\nOMB’s private sector employment forecast grows by over 2 percent annually, on average through 2027. In contrast, the Comptroller’s forecast expects that relatively little post-pandemic catch-up remains and assumes that—after a brief slowdown in 2023-24—overall NYC employment resumes growth at historically typical rates.\nNYC Labor Market\nThere are indications that New York City does not have as taut a labor market as exists for the whole U.S. Unemployment in the city stood at 5.9 percent in December, compared to 3.5 percent nationally. Job openings and quits data are not available at the NYC level, but statewide rates should be heavily influenced by conditions in the city. The ratio of job openings per unemployed worker in New York State has recently fallen to 1.1, compared with 1.9 per unemployed person in the U.S. The statewide quits rate of 1.8 percent is also much smaller than the national average of 2.7 percent.[4]\nChart 4 suggests a change in New York local labor market conditions possibly occurring in the past year. The plot shows what is known as a “Beveridge Curve” for New York State, which relates the rate of job openings to the rate of unemployment, each as a share of the labor force. While these rates are usually inversely related, the pandemic shifted this curve to the right where it has remained for most of the recovery period—indicating a higher number of job openings at every level of unemployment. This most likely reflects a sudden shock to the supply of labor—more than 300,000 people left the NYC labor force in the initial months of the pandemic and most have not returned. But in the past year, New York’s rate of job openings has been falling without unemployment rates rising—consistent with a gradual adjustment that is shifting the curve back to its longer-run level. This suggests that labor markets in NYC may no longer be so tight.\nChart 4. Beveridge Curve for New York State\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics\nInflation in the NY Area\nOn a 12-month basis, headline CPI in the NY area peaked at 6.7 percent in June of 2022 and was 6.0 percent in January of 2023. However, core CPI, which subtracts the more volatile food and energy components from the consumption basket, continues to increase and reached a post-pandemic high of 5.7 percent in January. This is largely because the shelter category of expenses, which represents 39.7 percent of the overall basket, jumped from a 2.1 percent increase in June 2022 to a 5.8 percent increase in January 2023 (see Chart 5).\nChart 5. NY Area CPI Inflation (12-month Percent Change)\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics\nThe steep increase in shelter inflation follows the well-documented large increase in market rate rents that is reflected in the CPI with a lag due to the time needed for rent contracts to reset at a higher price. Chart 6 shows year-over-year (yoy) percentage changes for the StreetEasy repeat rent index and NY shelter CPI lagged two quarters. Given the (relative) softening of market rate rent growth NY CPI shelter inflation might peak in the second quarter of 2023 and will continue to sustain core CPI inflation.\nChart 6. NY Area Shelter Inflation and Market Rent Index (Year-over-Year Percent Change)\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, StreetEasy\nConsumer Spending and Taxable Sales\nAs recently reported, the shift toward hybrid work schedules has disproportionately impacted spending by commuters into Manhattan’s central business districts. Manhattan resident spending also appears to be growing less than for other residents of NYC—likely a result of outmigration—according to data available from the Opportunity Insights project[5] and sourced from Affinity Solutions. Chart 7 shows the 8-week moving average of the indexes for NYC, Manhattan, and the average of Queens and Staten Island (Bronx and Brooklyn are not available). The 8-week moving average of consumer spending in NYC is 12.3 percent above pre-pandemic levels, with a large wedge between Manhattan (2.4 percent above January 2020) and the average of Queens and Staten Island (20.4 percent above January 2020).\nChart 7. Consumer Spending Indexed to January 2020\nSOURCE: Opportunity Insights, Office of the NYC Comptroller\nGiven the differences in data sources and methodologies, the consumer spending data lines up reasonably well with data on taxable sales provided by the NYS Department of Taxation and Finance, available up to the quarter ending in November 2022.[6] Without adjusting for inflation, overall taxable sales were 14.2 percent above the level in the first quarter of 2020 and the consumer spending measure was up 12.2 percent, as shown in Chart 8 below. Consumer spending was affected relatively less than taxable sales for at least two reasons. First, consumption shifted toward non-taxable items (e.g., groceries) in the first months of the pandemic. Second the precipitous decline in tourism affected taxable sales directly but not resident spending.\nChart 8. Consumer Spending and Taxable Sales in NYC\nSOURCE: NYS Department of Taxation and Finance, Opportunity Insights, Office of the NYC Comptroller\nThe growth of taxable sales, while still robust, is starting to moderate. Table 7 reports yearly growth rates for total sales and for its three main categories accounting for roughly two thirds of all taxable sales. Total sales grew 11.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 in nominal terms, pushed by high inflation. In real terms, they have returned to 4.1 percent, within the norm of pre-pandemic quarterly growth rates. In 2022Q4 the retail category posted weak nominal growth of 2.0 percent, affected by lower sales at gasoline stations and automobile dealers, similar to national trends. Additionally, the growth rate is skewed by an unusually high amount of sales in lawn and garden equipment stores in the third quarter of 2022. Accommodation and food services expanded by 35.7 percent (28.5 percent adjusted for inflation). Utilities and information services posted another strong quarter at 10.0 percent (2.7 percent adjusted for inflation). Inflation net of shelter peaked at 9.2 percent in the third quarter (June-August) of 2022 and dropped to 7.3 percent in the fourth. As inflation continues to decline, the growth in taxable sales should continue to moderate.\nTable 7.

According to Kastle Systems data measuring swipes into office buildings in the NY area, attendance reached 47.8 percent of the pre-pandemic baseline in the first quarter of 2023 (data up to the week of February 9). Employers surveyed by the Partnership for NYC (PFNYC) indicated that average attendance reached 52 percent in January of 2023. Mass transit ridership also continued to increase at the start of the year, more markedly for the subway system (Table 9).\nTable 9.

As shown in Table 10, the difference between actual and expected attendance dropped dramatically in 2022 as average attendance rose toward the mid-50s. In the latest survey, PFNYC switched to asking about long-term (“new normal”) expected attendance, which was only 4 percent higher than the reported actual. The data signals that attendance may be finally stabilizing. The survey indicated that 59 percent of employees were in the office 3 or more days per week. The modal schedule was 3 days/week for 35 percent of employees. The expectations for the “new normal” pin the percentage in office for 3 or more days at 66 percent (40 percent for 3 days), with only 7 percent fully remote.\nTable 10.

It is increasingly apparent that peak occupancy tends to be Tuesday through Thursday, and this is directionally confirmed by the data from Kastle Systems in Table 9. Because occupancy is not distributed uniformly through the week, any reduction in demand for office space is likely to be less than average attendance. Nonetheless, hybrid schedules imply a downward adjustment to space demanded per job. In its U.S. Real Estate Market Outlook for 2023, CBRE suggests that the reduction could be around 15 percent. In the first quarter of 2020 office space per job averaged 241 square feet. CBRE’s estimate suggests that, at current office-using jobs levels of around 1.5 million jobs (see Table 9 above), demand could be reduced by approximately 55 million square feet, other things equal.\nTable 11. NY-Area Office Swipes by Day of Week\n| Day of Week | Swipes as Percent of Baseline | ||\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2021Q1 | 2022Q1 | 2023Q1 (to 2/9) | |\n| Monday | 12.7% | 27.3% | 41.8% |\n| Tuesday | 14.1% | 34.1% | 57.0% |\n| Wednesday | 14.8% | 34.4% | 56.8% |\n| Thursday | 14.3% | 32.2% | 53.0% |\n| Friday | 11.7% | 18.8% | 25.6% |\nSOURCE: Kastle Systems, Office of the NYC Comptroller\nIn an indication that new high-quality office space continues to be attractive, the construction pipeline for office space continues to be robust. Market reports indicate 13 million square feet (msf) under construction, including, among others, Two Manhattan West (2 msf), PENN 2 (1.6 msf), 1 Madison Avenue (1.4 msf).\nThe residential market remained strong in 2022 but growth in rents moderated from the blistering pace established in the first half of the year. As shown in Chart 9, median New York City asking rents held steady at $3,400 in December 2022. Rents remain up 16 percent from pre-pandemic levels and up 27 percent from the pandemic lows. Available inventory remained low and started sliding in the second half of the year. Supply averaged 28.8 thousand apartments per month in 2022, 24.8 percent less than in 2019.\nChart 9. Residential Rents and Inventory\nSimilar to rents, sale prices have started to moderate, with the median and mean price for condos and coops in Manhattan dropping 5.5 percent and 0.4 percent in 2022Q4 from a year ago, according to the latest Elliman report. The Case-Shiller index for condos in the NY area is also decelerating, with prices growing 5.1 percent in November 2022 over the previous 12 months. The condo index peaked in August and has declined through November. The repeat sale index produced by StreetEasy specifically for NYC also peaked in August, although this index has fluctuated less than the Case-Shiller data.\nTourism\nNYC hotels capped off a strong year in December 2022 with total room demand hitting 93 percent of its December 2019 level (92 percent for the entire last quarter). For the whole year demand was 85.4 percent of 2019 levels, dragged down by the spread of COVID-19 variants at the beginning of 2022. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) was $303, 14 percent higher than December 2019 (not adjusted for inflation). With more than 11,000 rooms in the pipeline, supply growth is expected to remain robust.\nPassenger volume at Port Authority’s airports increased sharply, going from 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels in December 2021 to 96 percent (or 11.4 million passengers) in December 2022. The total number of passengers in 2022 was 91 percent of 2019 levels (or 128.1 million passengers). The gain in international visitors was steeper, with December 2022 climbing to 88 percent of December 2019 levels vs. 63 percent in December 2021. The recent reopening of China to international travel could lift the outlook for tourism in 2023.\nRisks to the Forecast\nThe U.S. economy is at a precarious moment where there is significant risk of a recession predicated by tightening monetary policy. The Fed has made its intentions clear that it will raise rates and even risk a downturn if inflation is not kept in check. Even though the “soft landing” scenario remains intact so far, a few months of wage and price growth could alter the near-term economic outlook significantly. Due to the strength of recent data on payroll jobs, consumer spending, and core services inflation, a “no landing” scenario has started to emerge, where the Fed needs to raise rates more to tighten financial conditions and slow down demand. Negotiations regarding the U.S. debt ceiling could also generate market volatility. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the government’s ability to issue additional debt could be exhausted between July and September.\nAt the city level, an additional risk derives from the possibility of deeper job losses in the securities and tech sectors, and in overall office-using employment. Higher interest rates (especially long-term rates) and stagnating or declining leasing activity could be a source of real financial stress for commercial real estate. Widespread monetary tightening and supply shocks could also slow the global economy beyond projections, slowing down the recovery of international travel and tourism spending.\nIII. The FY 2024 Preliminary Budget\nThe FY 2024 Preliminary Budget totals $102.66 billion, $3.73 billion less than the modified FY 2023 budget. Excluding reserves and adjustments, the January 2023 Financial Plan reflects $108.53 billion in FY 2023 spending, decreasing to $103.37 billion in FY 2024.\nThe drop in spending between FY 2023 and FY 2024 primarily reflects the continued ramp down of COVID grant-related spending of $1.6 billion, as well as the $1 billion in projected expenditures for the asylum seekers included in FY 2023 only. The remaining decreases are seen in general contractual services.\nChanges to the FY 2023 Modified Budget and the FY 2024 Preliminary Budget since the November Plan are depicted in Table 12.\nTable 12.

The January Financial Plan proposes cutting City-funded vacancies by 3,660, resulting in a savings of $1.32 billion across the Plan in salary and fringe costs. The largest number of positions cut are in the Department of Social Services (773 positions), the Department of Education (390 non-pedagogical positions), and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (403 positions).\nRevenue-generating initiatives total $72.1 million in savings throughout the January Plan, with $65.3 million in FY 2023. Most of these initiatives were already identified in the November 2022 Financial Plan, but FY 2023 savings were not accounted for at that time. Revenue proposals tied to new (not included in November) initiatives total $18.2 million, all in FY 2023 – with the bulk of revenue ($13.8 million) coming from the Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI, formerly known as the Department of Information & Telecommunications) mobile telecommunication franchising to offset declines in cable franchise revenues.\nIn a reversal from the City’s typical budget cycle, the January Plan PEG was far more technical than the November 2022 Plan PEG. The table below provides a look at savings from the PEG across the two plans. For a detailed analysis on the November 2022 Plan PEG, refer to the PEG section of the Comptroller’s latest Annual State of the City’s Economy and Finances.\nTable 13.

All categories of tax revenue are forecast to come in higher than planned in the current fiscal year and FY 2024, with Audits notably higher in FY 2023 at $579 million above Plan. The Comptroller’s Office forecast for Property Revenue grows significantly higher than the City’s Plan in the outyears. All other tax revenues are higher than planned in each year, except business taxes and real estate transaction taxes which begin to fall below OMB’s forecast in FY 2025 and FY 2026, respectively.\nMiscellaneous Revenues show a slight risk in FY 2023 due to the possible non-payment from the City’s vendor for bus shelter advertising. Fines are anticipated to come in higher in all years of the Plan.\nIn total, revenue offsets against the Plan are $1.38 billion in FY 2023, $2.32 billion in FY 2024, $1.90 billion in FY 2025, $2.19 billion in FY 2026, and $3.61 billion in FY 2027.\nExpenditures\nThe current Financial Plan holds a labor reserve to cover annual wage increases of 1.25 percent pertaining to collective bargaining agreements. Since the January Plan was released, the City has come to a tentative agreement with DC 37, the City’s largest union, for increases of 3 percent for the first four years of the agreement (retroactive to FY 2021) and 3.25 percent in the fifth year. The agreement also includes a one-time bonus of $3,000 upon ratification of the agreement. Typically, other unions follow the established pattern, though certain unions could negotiate higher increases. If followed, the DC 37 pattern is estimated to cost $2.5 billion in FY 2023, $1.8 billion in FY 2024, $3.4 billion in FY 2025, $3.9 billion in FY 2026, and $4.7 billion in FY 2027, based on the timing of the specific contract expirations and the respective retroactive payments associated with each contract. These amounts are above what is currently held in the labor reserve.\nOther personnel expenditure variances against the four-year plan include payroll savings due to the current high vacancy rate and elevated temporary staff and overtime expenses compared to the budget.\nThe Comptroller’s Office is including a variety of risks within the Department of Education’s budget against the January Plan. Some of these are familiar risks that the office has previously included relating to the exhaustion of federal stimulus funds (fiscal cliffs associated with Summer Rising, Special Education Pre-K Expansion, Universal 3-K, and Community Schools), and the chronic underbudgeting for Carter cases, pupil transportation, and charter school tuition. A new risk is now included for the class size mandates imposed by the State last year. The City is estimating the cost of implementing smaller class sizes will cost $1.3 billion annually once fully implemented. Furthermore, the additional risks posed by the Governor’s Executive Budget and the removal of the charter school cap, are not included in this number but could pose significant exposure. See the Department of Education section for a further discussion of these items.\nOther risks include underbudgeting within the City’s ongoing support of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The City is currently required to pay 50 percent of the paratransit expenses, for a risk of $48 million in FY 2023 growing to $120 million in FY 2027. The City’s budgeted amounts for the operating subsidies to the MTA Bus Company and Staten Island Railway are also underestimated; an additional risk is included for these items of $26 million in FY 2023, growing to $372 million in FY 2027. Not included in the table, but also looming within the Governor’s Executive Budget is the possibility that the City will be required to contribute over $500 million further in additional paratransit costs, student MetroCards, and an enhanced Payroll Mobility Tax. See the State Executive Budget section for additional details on these items.\nThe Comptroller’s Office risks include several other items that are currently not funded in the Financial Plan. Funding required to cover foster care reimbursement costs associated with a State requirement to pay 100 percent of the rates set by the State Office of Children and Family Services is estimated at $47 million in the current year and annualizing at $118 million per year. In addition, a New York State Court decision increased the hourly rate to be paid to court appointed counsel, with an estimated annual cost to the City of $84 million. In addition, New York City reached a settlement in the Lynch class action case on behalf of former detainees whose releases had been delayed for hours or days after they made bail. The Comptroller’s Office is assuming that approximately 25 percent of the 72,000 potential claimants will come forward for payments of $3,500; the settlement will be paid by the City in FY 2024. The Comptroller’s Office is also watching several other class-action cases, including Dunn et al v. NYC which concerns the Department of Correction’s alleged failure to provide constitutionally appropriate incarceration conditions to detainees at Rikers Island, and the Onaida class action concerning the City’s former policy of enforcing requests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the Department of Correction.\nThe Comptroller’s estimated expense risk, including the impact of Collective Bargaining, but not including the unexpected and unpredictable forecast around asylum seekers noted below, is $2.68 billion in FY 2023, $3.83 billion in FY 2024, $5.81 billion in FY 2025, $7.40 billion in FY 2026, and $8.81 billion in FY 2027. Combined with the revenue offsets above, the net risk, not yet incorporated into the Financial Plan, is $1.30 billion in FY 2023, $1.51 billion in FY 2024, $3.90 billion in FY 2025, $5.21 billion in FY 2026 and $5.20 billion in FY 2027.\nThe Comptroller’s resulting restated budget gap for the January 2023 Plan is $1.30 billion in FY 2023, $1.51 billion in FY 2024, $7.07 billion in FY 2025, $10.22 billion in FY 2026, and $11.66 billion in FY 2027.\nAsylum Seekers\nThe Comptroller’s Office is carrying an expense risk of $400 million in FY 2023 and $2.8 billion in FY 2024, in line with OMB’s recently stated cost estimates for providing shelter and services to the asylum seekers, who continue to come to New York City and are driving the shelter census upward. Although President Biden has recently announced a more stringent policy to stem the flow of asylum seekers at the border, there is much uncertainty in how the courts will respond, and some level of new arrivals can be expected to continue, particularly given that the underlying causes in the home countries of many of these migrants remain unresolved. Also, the lack of sufficient affordable housing within the city suggests no simple alternative to the shelter system for those who arrive in New York without a place to live. The Comptroller’s Office is maintaining a below the line risk at $2.8 billion in the outyears, though acknowledging significant uncertainty in either direction. The City budgeted $1 billion in federal aid in FY 2023 when it first introduced these expenses in November. The Comptroller’s Office anticipates some level of federal reimbursement given the $800 million allocated nationally in the Omnibus appropriations bill in December, but is assuming only 25 percent of the allocation will come to New York City. Furthermore, the Governor has proposed to cover 29 percent of the shelter expenses for the asylum seekers, yet capped the amount at $1 billion over two years.\nState Executive Budget\nAs noted above and further outlined in the State Executive Budget section, the Governor’s proposed budget includes a variety of items that would have a potential negative impact on the City. These cost shifts and unfunded mandates would cost the City $992 million in FY 2024 and grow to approximately $2.3 billion over time if the charter cap is removed and the full number of allowable charter schools are implemented. The Comptroller’s Office will incorporate items that are in the State Budget into its assessment of Risks and Offsets once the Budget is enacted.\nRevenue Analysis\nTax Revenues\nThe January 2023 Plan revises expected local tax revenues upward by $1.3 billion in the current fiscal year (FY 2023) compared to the November 2022 Plan. This revision primarily reflects collections that have significantly exceeded OMB’s prior expectations thus far by a similar amount.\nThe second column to the left in Table 15 shows the FY 2023 variance of collections through December relative to the November 2022 projections. As of December, total tax revenues grew 13.2 percent from the same period in FY 2022 and were above expectations by $1.4 billion. Non-property taxes grew by 23.6 percent. Some of the strength is temporary, particularly in PIT due to the timing of collections and expected refunds related to the Pass-Through Entity Tax (PTET) and an anomalous amount of State/City offsets received at the end of October that are expected to be more fully reversed later in the fiscal year.[7] Even after correcting for these and other timing issues, non-property taxes grew 12.4 percent over the year, as noted at the bottom of the table.\nThe table also reports, in the fourth column, OMB’s full-year FY 2023 expected growth rate per the January Plan, which is slightly negative (-0.9 percent) despite the large positive growth in collections observed in the fiscal year to-date. Their prediction for non-property taxes in FY 2023 is down more than 6 percent from FY 2022 despite collections running over 12 percent higher than FY 2022 so far in this fiscal year (after collections timing adjustments). The last column in Table 15 shows the implicit rate of growth (year-over-year) in OMB’s January forecast for the remainder of FY 2023. Their forecast contains significant expected declines in non-property taxes, a drop of over 20 percent from the prior year (after adjusting for technical timing issues).\nTable 15.

Overall, tax revenues are projected to be $70.4 billion, up approximately $1.5 billion from our previous estimate.\nThe difference between the Comptroller’s and OMB’s tax revenues forecasts is reported in Table 16. The Comptroller’s Office expects tax revenues will be higher than OMB’s estimates by $1.4 billion in FY 2023, $2.3 billion in FY 2024, $1.8 billion in FY 2025, $2.1 billion in FY 2026, and $3.6 billion in 2027.[8]\nTable 16.

As of December 2022, the total RPT collections is $24.9 billion. The Department of Finance (DOF) released the tentative 2024 assessment roll in January 2023 and based on these tentative property values, the Comptroller forecasts that the RPT revenue in FY 2024 would be $32.4 billion, an increase of 3.2 percent over the FY 2023 revenue forecast. The growth in the revenue for FY 2024 is primarily due to an increase in values of Class 1 and Class 4 properties. The market values of Class 1 properties are estimated using sales of mostly one, two, and three-family homes. The median sales price for a one-family home sold outside Manhattan (these properties make up most of Class 1 properties) increased by 10.2 percent from 2020 to 2021 and 7.0 percent from 2021 to 2022. The Comptroller forecasts revenue growth for FY 2025 to FY 2027 would average 2.1 percent with revenue forecasted to be $34.6 billion in 2027.\nIn the tentative roll released by DOF, the total market value for all properties citywide increased by 6.1 percent from FY 2023 to $1.5 trillion. Class 1 and Class 4 properties saw the biggest increase in their market values at 8.3 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Even with this increase, the total market value of Class 4 properties remains below its pre-pandemic level in FY 2021. Class 2 properties had the smallest increase in market value at 0.9 percent. This was mainly due to the reduction in the market values of Manhattan rental and cooperative properties. The total taxable assessed value for all properties increased by 4.4 percent to $286.8 billion, with the biggest increase for Class 1 and Class 4 properties at 6.0 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively.\nProperty owners are given a period to request a review or to appeal their tentative assessments before the final roll is published in May. The Comptroller estimates that on the final roll, the total taxable assessed value will be $284.6 billion.\nThe Comptroller’s property tax revenue forecast for FY 2023 is $177.0 million more than the revenue forecast by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the January Plan. The difference between the revenue estimates increases from $576.8 million in FY 2024 to $2.5 billion for FY 2027. OMB has not yet incorporated the tentative FY 2024 roll in its forecast for FY 2024 to FY 2027. The difference in the revenue forecast for FY 2023 is primarily due to the differences in our forecast of refunds, net cancellations, and gross delinquency of the property tax reserve since the levy for FY2023 is set. The comptroller is forecasting a refund of $335.2 million vs. OMB forecast of $500 million, a net cancellation of $690.8 million vs OMB forecast of $703.4 million, and a gross delinquency of $559.7 million vs. OMB’s forecast of $600 million. Additionally, the FY 2023 proceeds from the sale of delinquent liens were moved to FY 2024, under the assumption that the authority to conduct a sale will be renewed at some point in the future. Finally, the FY 2023 forecast incorporates the lower estimated cost of the property tax rebate enacted in 2022 ($60 million vs. budgeted $90 million).\nPersonal Income Tax\nBoth OMB and the Comptroller expect NYC Personal Income Tax (PIT) to end FY 2023 lower than the prior year. PIT collections to-date have exceeded the prior year on the strength of withholding during the months before the high bonus season. But shrinking bonuses this winter plus the impact of a depressed stock market on January 2023 estimated payments have resulted in declining collections that are forecast to remain lower through the rest of the fiscal year.\nIncome tax withholding grew strongly through the first five months of fiscal year 2023—rising by 9.9 percent in July through November versus the same months in 2021—but flattened during the start of the bonus season, rising a scant 0.4 percent year-over-year in December 2022/January 2023. There is little doubt that the switch in fortune was mostly the result of the size of the bonuses themselves, particularly in the securities industry where bonuses are closely related to financial market performance. After an especially strong year in 2021 for profits and bonuses, Wall Street profits fell 56.3 percent in 2022. Based on our analysis of withholding up through February 24th, bonus payments are tracking a 20.5 percent decline versus the previous season.\nIncome tax installment payments also were also affected by the swings of markets, with estimated tax payments received in December and January 48 percent below the prior year. Capital gain and loss realizations are an important cause of fluctuations in estimated tax, and 2022 was the first year since 2009 to end with a lower stock market valuation than it began. As the final payment for the tax year, the January installment can be especially influenced by asset performance, as investors may realize losses (or smaller gains) at the close of the year and some taxpayers make an adjustment to their payments to account for their actual annual income. But even before January of this year, tax installments from June and September 2022 were declining by more than 30 percent from their 2021 levels, for an overall fiscal year decline through January of 40 percent (See Table 19 below).\nTable 19. PIT Collections FY through January\n| ($ in millions) | FY 2023 | FY 2022 | Growth |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Withholding | $6,349.6 | $5,968.3 | 6.4% |\n| Installments/Extension Payments | $992.9 | $1,660.7 | (40.2%) |\n| Returns | $223.6 | $135.4 | 65.1% |\n| Assessments | $148.7 | $150.5 | (1.2%) |\n| State/City Offsets | $1,172.0 | $384.0 | 205.2% |\n| Refunds | ($284.3) | ($276.1) | 3.0% |\n| Total Net of Admin Charges | $8,546.7 | $7,967.1 | 7.3% |\nSOURCE: Office of the NYC Comptroller, NYC Office of Management and Budget\nThe January Plan projects that the economy slows down rapidly to almost no growth in calendar year 2023, impacting both the total wage and capital income tax bases driving PIT collections. The Comptroller forecast is for a much less pronounced slowdown, with moderate growth this year, which accounts for much of the difference between PIT revenue forecasts in the near term.\nBusiness Taxes\nFY 2023 business tax collections (corporation taxes and Unincorporated Business Tax, net of audits) grew 0.6 percent through January. This is a sharp deceleration from the 22.9 percent gain in the same period in FY 2022 driven by lower collections in the finance sector as seen in Table 20. This is a consequence of lower profits in the securities sector (which are estimated to have declined 60 percent in 2022). For calendar year 2022, collections from the finance sector dropped 3.5 percent (12.7 percent for corporate taxes) while non-finance payments grew 14.7 percent. Correspondingly, the share of payments from the finance sector went from 41.2 percent in 2021 to 37.1 percent in 2022.\nTable 20. Business Taxes Gross Collections (Year-over-Year Growth)\n| Calendar Quarter | Finance | Non-Finance | Total |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2021Q1 | 36.8% | 1.0% | 11.1% |\n| 2021Q2 | 81.3% | 42.4% | 58.7% |\n| 2021Q3 | 29.2% | (2.0%) | 10.0% |\n| 2021Q4 | 27.6% | 16.1% | 20.0% |\n| 2022Q1 | 19.2% | 15.7% | 16.9% |\n| 2022Q2 | (12.2%) | 19.3% | 4.2% |\n| 2022Q3 | (19.5%) | 20.8% | 2.5% |\n| 2022Q4 | 6.2% | 2.7% | 4.0% |\nSOURCE: NYC DOF, Office of the NYC Comptroller\nIn FY 2023, the forecast calls for revenues to drop to $7.7 billion from $8.2 billion in FY 2022 (a 6.8 percent decline). Another decline to $7.2 billion is expected in FY 2024 as the economy slows down and Wall Street profits stabilize at $22.0 billion. Revenues are expected to stabilize in FY 2025 and resume growth afterward.\nSales Tax\nSales tax collections have risen sharply through the first seven months of FY 2023, growing by 16.0 percent over the same months of the prior year. Even the most recent collections data do not reveal a downward turn has yet occurred, with January 2023 collections 11.4 percent above January 2022.\nHowever, like OMB, the Comptroller expects the year-over-year growth to drop significantly over the remainder of the fiscal year as the impact of slower wage growth, lower bonuses, and declining savings puts an end to the post-pandemic spending spree that we have seen over the past year. The Comptroller forecasts sales tax collections to end FY 2023 9.2 percent above the prior year. This is higher than the OMB forecast of 6.9 percent growth. The OMB forecast implies that sales tax collections in the second half of FY 2023 will be slightly below collections in the same months of the prior fiscal year. This is consistent with their forecast of a sharper turn for the economy starting this fiscal year.\nThe difference between Comptroller and OMB projected sales tax revenue peaks in FY 2024, when our divergent views of economic and wage growth are most pronounced. Over the subsequent fiscal years, the differences recede with more stable growth rates.\nOther Taxes\nCollections from real estate transactions are declining but the pace of the decline is slowing. Chart 10 shows the 3-month moving average of MRT and RPTT on a steady downward path since September, with previous data reflecting strength at the end of FY 2022. As of January 2023, the 3-month moving averages stood at 38 percent and 49 percent below the previous year for MRT and RPTT, respectively.\nChart 10. MRT and RPTT Collections (3-Month Moving Average)\nSOURCE: NYC DOF, Office of the NYC Comptroller\nIn the forecast, we lift expectations for the current year by $141 million ($60 million above the January Plan’s assumption). The outlook for FY 2024 and beyond remains unchanged. However, because OMB lowered its forecast profile substantially, the Comptroller’s forecast is now providing offsets in FY 2024 ($305 million) and FY 2025 ($126 million) and a smaller risk in FY 2026 ($105 million).\nThe Comptroller’s forecast for the hotel occupancy tax assumes that demand in 2023 stabilizes just below the previous peak in 2019 and exceeds it in 2024. This is in line with NYC & Company’s estimates and OMB’s forecast profile. The Comptroller’s forecast provides offsets of $47 million in FY 2023, $14.3 million in FY 2024, and slightly larger amounts in the outyears of the Plan, peaking at $93.9 million in FY 2027.\nThe Office of the NYC Comptroller has long held that the financial plan underestimates the amount of City tax audits. The January Plan holds the amount at $721 million each year. Year-to-date through January the City has collected $958 million due to $481 million collected in January from the Banking Corporation Tax. Even at a reduced pace of $50 million per month for the remainder of the year (February through August), it appears likely that total tax audits can reach $1.3 billion. The City should be able to collect $900 million in tax audits in each year of the plan.\nRisks to the Tax Revenues Forecast\nThe elevated uncertainties surrounding the U.S. and NYC economies have an impact on the tax revenue forecast. OMB’s tax forecast—which reflects the consequences of very slow growth in 2023 but not a recession—will underestimate tax revenues if the economy holds up well through this year, as is now being predicted by many forecasters.\nThe Comptroller’s tax revenue forecast is based on a higher economic growth rate this year but still anticipates job declines and curtailed bonuses for certain key, high-wage industries. If financial markets remain more resilient, even the Comptroller’s tax revenue estimates may fall below future collections. If the economy falls into an actual recession—certainly a possibility given current Fed policy statements—tax revenues would be expected to be significantly lower than both OMB and the Comptroller project.\nMiscellaneous Revenues\nIn the January 2023 Financial Plan, the City raised its FY 2023 miscellaneous revenue projection by a net $433 million, to $5.77 billion, a 13.6 percent increase over the previous year. About $66 million of this revenue increase is included in the City’s January PEG Program. The bulk of the revision reflects higher projections for interest income and fine revenues. Table 21 shows the changes in the FY 2023 miscellaneous revenue projections since the November Plan.[9]\nTable 21. Changes in FY 2023 Miscellaneous Revenue Estimates\nJanuary 2023 Plan vs. November 2022 Plan\n| ($ in millions) | November | January | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Licenses, Permits & Franchises | $737 | $751 | $14 |\n| Interest Income | 107 | 325 | 218 |\n| Charges for Services | 1,029 | 1,004 | (25) |\n| Water and Sewer Charges | 1,801 | 1,817 | 16 |\n| Rental Income | 250 | 255 | 5 |\n| Fines and Forfeitures | 1,076 | 1,273 | 197 |\n| Other Miscellaneous | 337 | 345 | 8 |\n| Total | $5,337 | $5,770 | $433 |\nThe projected interest income for FY 2023 increased by $218 million to $325 million. This re-estimate, the first since the April 2022 Plan, reflects higher year-to-date collections following increases in short-term interest rates and greater than anticipated cash balances.\nThe Plan also raised FY 2023 fine revenue projections by $197 million to $1.27 billion to reflect higher than anticipated collections, in line with the Comptroller’s forecast after the November Plan. The bulk of this change reflects increased projections for camera fines. This includes $120 million in additional revenues from speed camera fines, $20 million in bus lane camera fines, and $9 million in red light camera fines. Projected revenues from parking violation fines also increased by about $50 million.\nRevenue projections for licenses, permits, and franchises increased by a net $14 million. This is mostly due to a $32 million increase in mobile telecommunication franchise revenues, which was partially offset by a $17 million decline in expected revenues from cable television franchises.\nRevenues from charges for services decreased by $25 million. The re-estimate reflects decreases in projected parking meter revenues ($27 million), fire inspection fees ($12.1 million), NYPD towing operations ($5.7 million), commissary funds ($3.5 million) and other fees. These were partially offset by increases in projected fee revenues from the Affordable NY Housing Program ($19 million), credit card convenience fees ($6.3 million), and 2 percent fire insurance fees ($5.4 million). Estimated rental income increased by $5 million, mostly to account for additional commercial rent revenue from arbitration of City commercial property.\nThe category “other miscellaneous” increased by a net $8 million including $4.4 million in additional auto auction revenue, $2.4 million in employee health contributions and $2.3 million in recycled bulk and paper sales revenue.\nTotal miscellaneous revenue projections for FYs 2024 and 2025 increased by a net $237 million and $102 million respectively. These adjustments include a $241 million increase in projected revenues from interest income in FY 2024 and a $103 million increase in FY 2025 which reflect higher short-term interest rate assumptions compared to the November Plan projections. FYs 2026 and 2027 projections remain relatively unchanged from the November Plan.\nTable 22 shows the City’s January Plan projections for all categories of miscellaneous revenues. After increasing 13.6 percent in FY 2023 to $5.8 billion, total miscellaneous revenues are expected to drop slightly to $5.6 billion in FY 2024 and remain stable over the remainder of the plan period ranging from $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion annually in FYs 2025-2027.\nTable 22. Miscellaneous Revenue Forecast January 2023 Plan\n| ($ in millions) | FY 2023 | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2026 | FY 2027 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Licenses, Permits & Franchises | $751 | $696 | $694 | $699 | $679 |\n| Interest Income | 325 | 402 | 298 | 228 | 225 |\n| Charges for Services | 1,004 | 1,024 | 1,026 | 1,026 | 1,026 |\n| Water and Sewer Charges | 1,817 | 1,768 | 1,755 | 1,749 | 1,749 |\n| Rental Income | 255 | 254 | 254 | 254 | 254 |\n| Fines and Forfeitures | 1,273 | 1,121 | 1,115 | 1,122 | 1,122 |\n| Other Miscellaneous | 345 | 349 | 339 | 338 | 338 |\n| Total | $5,770 | $5,614 | $5,481 | $5,416 | $5,393 |\nBased on the City’s January Plan projections and collection trends, the Comptroller’s Office projects total miscellaneous revenue will be below the City’s current forecasts by $55 million in FY 2023, and above the City’s forecast by $63 million in FY 2024, $68 million in FY 2025, and $53 million in each of FYs 2026-2027.\nAs discussed in the Annual Report on the State of the City’s Economy and Finances published in December, the Comptroller projects that the City’s bus stop franchise agreement with JCDecaux poses a risk of $108 million to FY 2023 revenues.\nOur projections for fine revenues are above the City’s current forecast by $53 million in FY 2023, $63 million in FY 2024, and $53 million in each of FYs 2025-2027. The Comptroller projects revenues from parking fines and camera violation fines will exceed current plan projections by a combined $45 million in FY 2023, $55 million in FY 2024, and $45 million annually in FYs 2025-2027. The Comptroller’s revenue projection for Environmental Control Board (ECB) fines is also above the City’s projection by $8 million in each of the FYs 2023 through 2027.\nFinally, based on the Comptroller’s forecast of short-term interest rates and cash balances, interest income will be above the City’s projections by $15 million in FY 2025.\nFederal and State Aid\nThe January Financial Plan projects total Federal and State aid of $29.73 billion (including unrestricted aid) in FY 2023, supporting nearly 28 percent of the City’s expenditure budget. Compared with the November Plan, the City has reflected an increase of $696 million in the current year comprised of $613 million in Federal aid and $83 million in State grants. Over the next two fiscal years, additional Federal funds of $466 million and $420 million are reflected in FY 2024 and FY 2025, respectively.\nThe increased Federal funding is primarily from the recognition of about $1.46 billion in COVID-related grants. Major changes in the January Plan include $1.08 billion in American Rescue Plan-State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (ARP SLFRF) grants and $300 million in ARP and Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) education grants resulting from the roll of unspent FY 2022 funding allocations, that were previously unaccounted for in the November Plan.\nThe January Plan reflects the roll of ARP SLFRF funds in increments ranging from $265 million to $425 million annually in FY 2023 – FY 2025. The recognition of ARP SLFRF funding produces funding swaps totaling $890 million, after adjusting for a $190 million allocation to Health + Hospitals in the current year. The swaps reduce City-funded spending by $75 million in FY 2023, $390 million in FY 2024, and $425 million in FY 2025. The largest funding shifts are $490 million for the Department of Sanitation and $75 million each for the Department of Social Services and Department of Parks and Recreation. The roll of ARP-CRRSA education grants has provided the DOE budget with corresponding increases of $220 million in FY 2023 and $80 million in FY 2024, further detailed in the Department of Education section later in the report.\nRevisions in the January Plan have raised total Federal COVID assistance anticipated by the City to $7.56 billion in FY 2023 – FY 2027, as shown in Table 23. The largest component is $3.99 billion in combined ARP-CRRSA education funding for the DOE budget, followed by $2.02 billion in ARP SLFRF and $768.5 million in FEMA grants (including unrestricted aid) currently reflected in the January Plan. These three funding categories constitute nearly 90 percent of the Federal COVID assistance assumed in the Plan. Combined with grants recognized in FY 2020 through FY 2022, which totaled about $18.88 billion, overall COVID-19 assistance is currently expected to reach $26.45 billion.\nTable 23. Projected Federal COVID Assistance – January 2023 Plan\n| ($ in millions) | FY 2023 | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2026 | FY 2027 | Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ARP SLFRF | $610.4 | $574.1 | $834.4 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $2,018.8 |\n| ARP-CRRSA Education | 1,991.3 | 1,747.9 | 245.8 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 3,985.1 |\n| FEMA | 515.9 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 516.9 |\n| Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity Grants |\n295.0 | 10.3 | 0.1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 305.4 |\n| All Other | 362.2 | 57.9 | 44.0 | 15.4 | 7.1 | 486.5 |\n| Subtotal | $3,774.7 | $2,391.1 | $1,124.3 | $15.4 | $7.1 | $7,312.7 |\n| Unrestricted Aid-FEMA | $251.6 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $251.6 |\n| Subtotal | $251.6 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $251.6 |\n| Grand Total | $4,026.3 | $2,391.1 | $1,124.3 | $15.4 | $7.1 | $7,564.3 |\nSOURCE: NYC Office of Management and Budget\nState grant changes in the January Plan (aggregate increase of $83 million) were concentrated in the social service-related agencies and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. These included a $42.2 million increase in FY 2023 funding for the Administration of Children’s Services tied to foster care and $35.1 million in OTPS and PS funding for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Public Health Works! Campaign. The remaining $6 million in increases reflects changes in a variety of other areas including $1.9 million for the Department of Youth and Community Development for runaway and homeless youth and a $1.5 million modification to support the Economic Development Corporation’s project to dredge Hammond’s Cove, flowing through the Department of Small Business Services.\nFederal and State grants are projected to fall sequentially in the outyears to $26.41 billion in FY 2024, $25.31 billion in FY 2025 before settling at about $24.2 billion annually in FY 2026 and FY 2027. This trend essentially mirrors the decline in Federal COVID-19 grants in the outyears and the absence of any expected Federal assistance for asylum seekers beyond FY 2023. Moreover, in the January Plan, the City anticipates State aid to grow by less than $250 million or slightly more than one percent, over the next four years. School aid, the largest component of State support, would grow modestly from $12.52 billion in the current year to $12.89 billion in FY 2025 and remain flat thereafter. As a result, Federal and State support of the City’s expenditure budget would taper to 25.7 percent in FY 2024 and 23.8 percent in FY 2025, and then level off at about 22 percent in both FY 2026 and FY 2027.\nState Executive Budget\nOn February 1st, Governor Kathy Hochul released a proposed budget for the State fiscal year that begins on April 1st. The State Department of Budget forecasts a surplus of $8.7 billion in its current fiscal year, largely due to an upward revision of $5.9 billion in tax receipts compared to the Mid-Year Update released in November. The Governor’s budget includes a number of proposals that will significantly impact the City (Table 24).\nPositive budget impacts were primarily found in formula-based school aid and funding support for New York City’s asylum crisis.\nRecord-level school aid was driven by the first ever full funding of the State’s Foundation Aid formula. However, the City is set to receive only 21 percent of the historic $2.73 billion increase. For a full discussion of education funding, refer to the Department of Education section of this report.\nThe State has pledged to contribute 29 percent of shelter costs for asylum seekers but capped the amount at $1 billion over two years. After the release of the City’s Preliminary Budget, the New York City Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reported that asylum seeker costs were revised upwards by a large margin, to $1.4 billion in FY 2023 and $2.8 billion in FY 2024 – effectively reducing the State’s promised share of contributions to 23.8 percent ($1 billion of the new $4.2 billion estimate) of costs. For a comprehensive discussion of the asylum crisis, refer to the Homeless Services and Asylum Seeker Emergency section of this report.\nWhile the Governor’s budget also includes $300 million in one-time aid for the MTA, it concurrently proposes raising New York City contributions to the transit system by over $500 million per year. These additional contributions include the City fully reimbursing net operating shortfalls for paratransit services at an additional cost of $266 million in FY 2024, $105 million a year in costs associated with taking over payments for student MetroCards, and a Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) offset of $115 million a year to cover the costs of revenue from exempt organizations including libraries and schools. The City also estimates an additional $40 million a year in costs associated with City agency and contractor payments resulting from a proposed rise in the PMT (also referred to as the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax or MCTMT) from 0.34 percent to .50 percent. Lastly, the Governor’s budget proposes allocating the City’s full 20 percent share of any potential future casino revenue directly to the MTA on top of the proposed $500 million contribution just described; other localities would retain their local shares of casino revenue.\nThe Governor’s Executive budget also puts forward intercepting Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (eFMAP) funds intended for local use. The eFMAP funds are provided by the federal government based on proportionate shares paid into Medicaid and historically passed on to localities to pay for services. Under the Governor’s proposed budget, these funds would shift to the State, costing New York City $343 million and other counties $281 million per year.\nThe budget also proposes a mandate on health insurers to pay emergency department visits and emergency admissions up-front, requiring them to pursue recoupments for payments of any stays subsequently deemed not medically necessary. OMB estimates this “Pay and Pursue” policy, if enacted, would increase the City’s health insurance costs by $36 million in FY 2024 and $75 million in FY 2025, with costs continuing to increase in future fiscal years.[10] NYC Health + Hospitals would benefit from the policy, as would other non-public hospitals throughout the City.\nThe Governor also proposes indexing the State’s minimum wage of $15 to inflation, with several off-ramps that would limit the impact of the policy if approved.[11] NYC OMB initially estimated a cost impact of $15 million in FY 2024 and $180 million over the financial plan period to cover City employee and contractor wage increases resulting from this action. Recently, the Administration tentatively came to terms with DC 37, the City’s largest municipal employee union, on a new employment contract to take effect retroactively from 2021 to 2025. This agreement increases wages by 3% a year, outpacing the Governor’s proposal. The Comptroller’s Office assumes other unions will follow this pattern, and the agreed-upon increases will be passed on to contracted employees at a similar level, reducing the impact of the Governor’s proposal to $5 million in FY 2024 and $89 million over the four years of the Financial Plan. The remaining costs are primarily due to college interns and Summer Youth Employment Program participants, whose wage status is not yet clear. A more expansive bill, Raise Up NY, sponsored by Senator Jessica Ramos (S3062D/A7503C) would increase the minimum wage over three years and then index it to inflation. If passed, it would cost the City over the Financial Plan period approximately $600 million, largely to cover the cost of contracted human service workers.\nTable 24.

This would potentially add 85 new charter schools and revive over 20 “zombie” charters without additional State funding. The charter school reforms are estimated to cost the City up to $1.3 billion in additional funds if fully implemented, representing a 44 percent increase in costs to the City for charters based on projected FY 2023 charter school spending in the DOE budget. Unlike other localities in the State, NYC is not eligible for Transition Aid to offset the cost of charter school tuition, and is also responsible for the leasing expenses when charter schools are located in public buildings. Further discussion on charters is also located in the Department of Education section of this report.\nOutside the Financial Plan window, the Waste Reduction and Recycling Infrastructure Act mandating responsibility for disposal management to producers of packaging and paper products is expected to save the City $50 million by FY 2028 and $100 million in FY 2029 and out.\nThe budget also includes policy proposals to encourage residential housing development, a “Cap-and-Invest” program to limit greenhouse gas emissions, a community hiring initiative for candidates from disadvantaged backgrounds, the renewal of J-51 property tax exemptions for renovations on residential buildings, the right for New York City to lower its speed limit, and expanded mental health services including specialized housing options and additional hospital beds.\nExpenditures Analysis\nThe January Financial Plan reflects $106.39 billion in spending in FY 2023, decreasing to $102.66 billion in FY 2024, and then growing to $110.99 billion in FY 2027. Both FY 2023 and FY 2024 expenditures include prior year adjustments which artificially lower expenditures by $3.95 billion and $2.17 billion, respectively. Excluding these adjustments and reserves, the FY 2023 expenditure budget of $108.53 will drop to $103.37 billion in FY 2024 before increasing to $104.87 billion in FY 2025, $106.99 billion in FY 2026, and $109.53 billion in FY 2027.\nThe largest change in the expenditure budget over the financial plan is a $6.53 billion decrease in OTPS between FY 2023 and FY 2024, specifically in the Contractual Services and Other OTPS categories. This is primarily due to:\n- $1 billion in spending for asylum seekers included in FY 2023 only;\n- a $1.6 billion ramp down in COVID grant-related spending;\n- a $1.3 billion decrease in contractual services spending across City agencies;\n- a $733 million decrease in all other DOE/CUNY OTPS;\n- and a $408 million decrease for Temp Services.\nPersonnel services grow by 10.2 percent over the life of the plan, largely driven by health insurance premium growth, as well as headcount, pension contributions, and other fringe benefits changes.\nTable 25.

At the time of the Adopted Plan, the number of full-time employees for FY 2023 was forecast to be 306,302 by June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, full-time headcount has remained relatively stable, declining slightly to 280,987 employees. As stated in the Comptroller’s Office report, Title Vacant, the City is facing a vacancy crisis at many agencies.\nWith so many vacancies going unfilled, the January Plan reflects budgetary savings of more than $200 million in FY 2023 resulting from personnel and vacancy reductions since budget adoption. More than a quarter of the positions reduced are at agencies that provide health and welfare services – the Department of Social Services (DSS) with a reduction of 938 positions, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) with 403, and the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) with 107. As shown in Table 26, several agencies saw more than 10 percent of their authorized headcounts lowered, including the Department of Correction (DOC), City University (CUNY), and the Law Department.\nTable 26. Personnel Reductions (Civilian Only) FY 2023 Full-time Headcount\n| Agency | FY 2023 | FY 2023 Adopted Budget Plan | PEG % Adopted Budget Plan | ||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Total HC Reduction | City Funded | Other Funding | |||\n| Social Services | 938 | 773 | 165 | 13,023 | 7.2% |\n| Police | 504 | 504 | 0 | 15,042 | 3.4% |\n| Health & Mental Hygiene | 403 | 403 | 0 | 6,050 | 6.7% |\n| Education | 390 | 390 | 0 | 13,472 | 2.9% |\n| Transportation | 271 | 155 | 116 | 5,708 | 4.7% |\n| Parks and Recreation | 259 | 200 | 59 | 4,830 | 5.4% |\n| Correction | 244 | 244 | 0 | 1,974 | 12.4% |\n| City University | 200 | 200 | 0 | 1,946 | 10.3% |\n| Law Department | 177 | 177 | 0 | 1,704 | 10.4% |\n| Fire Department* | 166 | 166 | 0 | 6,537 | 2.5% |\n| Environmental Protection | 138 | 14 | 124 | 6,413 | 2.2% |\n| Design and Construction | 123 | 0 | 123 | 1,310 | 9.4% |\n| Finance | 116 | 116 | 0 | 1,992 | 5.8% |\n| Mayoralty | 116 | 114 | 2 | 1,395 | 8.3% |\n| DCAS | 107 | 107 | 0 | 2,428 | 4.4% |\n| Homeless Services | 107 | 107 | 0 | 2,012 | 5.3% |\n| Technology | 101 | 101 | 0 | 1,755 | 5.8% |\n| All Other | 623 | 592 | 51 | 218,711 | 0.3% |\n| TOTAL | 5,003 | 4,363 | 640 | 306,302 | 1.6% |\n* Includes reduction of 54 positions resulting from the re-estimate of the B-HEARD program.\nAlso shown in Table 26, most of the reductions to FY 2023 authorized headcount, about 87 percent, were for City-funded positions. About 10 percent of the total reflected reductions were supported through Inter-Fund Agreements (IFAs). IFAs are internal City contracts whereby there is an agreement to use funds earmarked for the capital budget to reimburse the general fund for the cost of City employees who work on specific capital projects. The remaining reduction of 165 positions was at the Department of Social Services (DSS), Medicaid Eligibility Unit. The authorized headcount for that unit was reduced from 791 at budget adoption to 626 in the January Plan.\nThe reductions to FY 2023 budgeted headcount were partly offset by increases of 271 positions to support new initiatives and a net increase from other adjustments (primarily, headcount revisions) of 1,047 positions. These actions altogether resulted in a net decrease of 3,685 positions since budget adoption as shown in Table 27. The actual headcount level as of December 31, 2022 highlights a gap in planned hiring for FY 2023 of 21,630. It is interesting to note that despite the number of vacancy reductions at DSS, the agency still has the authorization to hire 1,746 employees by the end of FY 2023. DSS, DOHMH, and DHS together are expected to hire more than 2,500 positions by year-end to achieve their authorized headcount levels. It is unlikely that agencies will be able to achieve their planned headcount levels by the end of the fiscal year. The Comptroller’s Office is carrying an offset against the budget for these vacancies in FY 2023 of $714 million and $357 million in FY 2024, as well as risks for the overtime and temporary services used to compensate.\nTable 27.

The overall decline in headcount is driven primarily by lower projections for Department of Education (DOE) pedagogical employees and civilian employees. As shown in Table 28, pedagogical employees’ headcount at DOE is projected to decline between FY 2023 and FY 2027 by 3,528, and civilian employees’ headcount is expected to decrease by 554 in the same period.\nTable 28.

The current balance in the labor reserve of $1.38 billion in FY 2023, $1.91 billion in FY 2024, $2.55 billion in FY 2025, $3.22 billion in FY 2026, and $3.88 billion in FY 2027 was held primarily to provide annual wage increases of 1.25 percent.\nSince the January Plan was released, the City announced a tentative agreement with DC 37, the City’s largest union, for increases of 3 percent for the first four years of the agreement (retroactive to FY 2021) and 3.25 percent in the fifth year. The agreement includes an Equity Fund of $70 million to provide for salary adjustments for hard-to-recruit positions and to ensure that all employees represented by DC 37 will make at least $18 an hour as of July 1, 2023. Members will also receive a one-time bonus of $3,000 upon ratification of the agreement. This agreement is estimated to cost the City $4.4 billion through FY 2027. Typically, other unions and management follow the established pattern and if so, the agreements will cost the City $26 billion through FY 2027 for all employees. After offsets from funds held in the labor reserve, the remaining costs to the City are estimated to be $2.5 billion in FY 2023, $1.8 billion in FY 2024, $3.4 billion in FY 2025, $3.9 billion in FY 2026, and $4.7 billion in FY 2027, based on the timing of the specific contract expirations and the respective retroactive payments associated with each contract.\nThe Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association (PBA) is the only major union that has yet to reach a labor agreement with the City under the previous round of collective bargaining. Labor negotiations between the City and PBA were declared at an impasse by the New York State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). Both parties have presented arguments before an arbitration panel and are currently awaiting a final ruling. The City has funded this contract based on the pattern established by the Uniformed Officers Coalition of 7.95 percent over three years. Through FY 2023, approximately $1.3 billion retroactive to August 2017 has been allocated both through accruals and in the labor reserve.\nOvertime\nThe FY 2024 Preliminary Budget includes $1.23 billion for overtime expenditures, 23 percent lower than the $1.60 billion currently budgeted for FY 2023. Based on the current overtime spending trend, both FYs 2023 and 2024 overtime costs will likely exceed the Plan’s budget. As shown in Table 29, the Comptroller’s Office expects overtime expenditures to exceed Plan projections by $651 million in FY 2023 and $563 million in FY 2024.\nTable 29. Projected Overtime Spending, FY 2023 and FY 2024\n| ($ in millions) | FY 2023 Adopted Budget | FY 2023 January Plan | FY 2023 Comptroller’s Projection | FY 2023 Risk | FY 2024 Preliminary Budget | FY 2024 Comptroller’s Projection | FY 2024 Risk |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Uniformed | |||||||\n| Police | $372 | $374 | $640 | ($266) | $372 | $650 | ($278) |\n| Enhanced Subway Safety | N/A | 0 | 100 | (100) | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Fire | 252 | 418 | 418 | 0 | 244 | 275 | (31) |\n| Correction | 126 | 126 | 250 | (124) | 126 | 200 | (74) |\n| Sanitation | 148 | 169 | 169 | 0 | 109 | 109 | 0 |\n| Total Uniformed | $898 | $1,087 | $1,577 | ($490) | $851 | $1,234 | ($383) |\n| Civilian | |||||||\n| Police-Civilian | 80 | $81 | $120 | ($39) | $81 | $100 | ($19) |\n| Social Services | 16 | 57 | 80 | (23) | 16 | 60 | (44) |\n| All Other Agencies | 306 | 376 | 475 | (99) | 283 | 400 | (117) |\n| Total Civilians | $402 | $514 | $675 | ($161) | $380 | $560 | ($180) |\n| Total City Risk | $1,300 | $1,601 | $2,252 | ($651) | $1,231 | $1,794 | ($563) |\n| State funding for Enhanced Subway Safety through January* | N/A | N/A | N/A | 62 | |||\n| Adjusted risk | N/A | N/A | N/A | ($589) | N/A | N/A | ($563) |\n* “Mayor Eric Adams Makes a Subway Safety-Related Announcement with Governor Kathy Hochul”, January 27, 2023. Adjustment to risk will be made if the Enacted State Budget includes this funding.\nThe City has increased its overtime expenditure projections for FY 2023 by $224 million in the January 2023 Financial Plan, for a total of $300 million since the budget adoption. Seventy-one percent or $213 million of the total increase to the overtime budget went to FDNY, with $166 million budgeted for uniformed overtime spending. Of that amount, $155 million was added in the January Plan. FDNY uniformed headcount has declined from 10,952 employees as of June 30, 2022 to 10,647 by December 31, 2022. By June 30, 2023, the department is authorized to add 307 uniformed employees. If filled, these positions should reduce overtime usage in FY 2024, as it appears likely that spending for FDNY uniformed overtime in FY 2024 will be similar to the pre-pandemic average of $275 million, for a risk of $31 million.\nThe City routinely underbudgets police uniformed overtime costs in an effort to stem the growth in overtime expenditures. The January 2023 Financial Plan includes $374 million for that expense in FY 2023 and $372 million for FY 2024. These amounts are overly optimistic when compared to actual overtime spending of $671 million in FY 2022. Past attempts to reduce police uniformed overtime spending have not been very successful. Currently, the NYPD continues to utilize higher overtime usage to address increased criminal activity, including within the subway system. For most of FY 2022, the City was faced with rising crime within the system with major crimes increasing more than 50 percent when compared to FY 2021. This trend continued into FY 2023, with an increase of 27 percent during the first four months when compared to the same period in FY 2022. In response, the City, with the support of the State, implemented the Cops, Cameras and Care program, whereby 1,200 additional patrol shifts were added daily within the subway system at an estimated cost of $680,000 per day, beginning in late October. Three months into this program, overtime costs of $62 million have been incurred. The Governor has indicated that the State will reimburse the City for the costs spent through January. Since the program began, major crimes within the subway system have declined by 28 percent, and the City is committed to continuing this program. Each additional month at the current level of spending will increase overtime cost by approximately $20 million. Assuming that the program continues at this level through March 2023 coupled with historical patterns of overtime that are continuing, the Comptroller’s Office projects that NYPD uniformed overtime costs could pose risks to the budget of at least $366 million for FY 2023 and $278 million for FY 2024; the risk will be reduced if the Governor’s committed amount is included in the enacted State budget.\nThere are also risks to the DOC uniformed overtime budget of $124 million in FY 2023 and $74 million in FY 2024. DOC continues to face challenges in hiring uniformed staff, exerting upward pressure on the use of overtime.\nThe City’s spending for civilian overtime averaged $585 million between FY 2016 and FY 2020. That spending declined to $510 million in FY 2021 due to the scale-back on everyday operations and non-essential City employees working from home. However, as the City faced difficulties in hiring employees and relied more on overtime usage for FY 2022, that cost increased to $660 million. The Comptroller’s Office projects civilian overtime spending of at least $675 million for FY 2023 and $560 million for FY 2024.\nActual overtime costs have consistently been much higher than the Adopted Budget forecast in prior fiscal years. Between FYs 2013 and 2017, actual overtime costs averaged 43 percent higher, ranging from 24 percent higher than the FY 2013 Adopted Budget to 54 percent above the FY 2016 Adopted Budget (Chart 11). In FY 2022, actual overtime costs of $2.22 billion were almost double the Adopted Budget estimate of $1.15 billion due to lower headcount levels and the COVID-19 outbreak in the winter of 2022. Because actual headcount this year remains at consistently low levels, the Comptroller’s Office is expecting overall overtime in FY 2023 to remain consistent with the FY 2022 level, as shown in Table 29 above.\nChart 11. Overtime Expenditures FY 2013 – FY 2022\nSOURCE: NYC Annual Comprehensive Financial Report of the Comptroller adjusted for unplanned events such as Hurricane Sandy and protests following the deaths of Eric Garner in 2014 and George Floyd in 2020\nTemporary and Contracted Professional Services\nCity agencies often contract with outside vendors to staff and perform essential functions. These include temporary services and various professional services, including legal services, accounting services, architectural and engineering services, and other consultant services, and can be used to counter high vacancy rates in particular areas or titles, or to fill a temporary or highly specialized need. The January 2023 Plan forecasts $1.25 billion in spending authority in FY 2023, sharply decreasing to $809.6 million in FY 2024, and then slowly ramping down to $764.7 million in FY 2027. Historically, the City conservatively budgets these expenses in the Adopted Plan, particularly in Computer Services, Legal Services, Professional Services-Other, and Temporary Services. The City then adjusts spending throughout the fiscal year in each Plan (Table 30). Since FY 2019, agencies have consistently committed and spent upwards of $1 billion, with $1.18 billion already committed for FY 2023. It is likely that agencies will still require these services at a similar level to current spending in FY 2024, which could pose a risk of $194 million to the FY 2024 budget (Table 31). The City may reduce its reliance on these services if it hires up to its authorized headcount in the outyears.\nTable 30.

The increase from FY 2023 reflects projected premium rate increases of 6 percent for active employees and pre-Medicare retirees and 4.8 percent for the senior care rate. Health insurance costs are then projected to increase to $9.57 billion in FY 2025, $10.18 billion in FY 2026 and to $10.63 billion in FY 2027, growing at an annual rate of 6.4 percent. The outyear projections assume annual increases in health insurance premium rates for active employees and pre-Medicare retirees of 5.75 percent in FY 2025, 5.5 percent in FY 2026, and 5.25 percent in FY 2027. Senior care rates are projected to increase by 4.7 percent for FY 2025 and FY 2026 and 4.6 percent in FY 2027.\nTable 32. Projected Pay-As-You-Go Health Expenditures\n| ($ in millions) | FY 2023 | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2026 | FY 2027 |\n| Department of Education | $2,740 | $3,249 | $3,681 | $3,990 | $4,131 |\n| CUNY | 139 | 138 | 150 | 150 | 163 |\n| All Other | 4,292 | 5,435 | 5,733 | 6,035 | 6,336 |\n| Sub-total | 7,170 | 8,822 | 9,565 | 10,175 | 10,630 |\n| FY 2023 Retiree Health Prepayment | 792 | ||||\n| PAYGO Health Insurance Costs | $7,962 | $8,822 | $9,565 | $10,175 | $10,630 |\nCompared to the November 2022 Financial Plan, budgeted amounts for health insurance are lower by $70 million in FY 2023 and by an average of $94 million annually in the outyears. Fringe benefit costs for employees were re-estimated to reflect lower projected headcount levels resulting from the vacancy reductions.\nThe continued growth in health insurance premium costs poses a major challenge to the City. With the support of the Municipal Labor Committee (MLC), the City in 2021 announced a plan to implement the NYC Medicare Advantage Plus Program, replacing the current Senior Care program for retirees. If this plan is implemented, the City estimates an annual cost savings of approximately $600 million, which would be deposited into the Health Insurance Stabilization Fund.[12] Retirees challenging this plan were successful in obtaining court decisions requiring the City to honor the current laws relating to health insurance coverage in the City’s Administrative Code.[13] A proposal put forward by the Mayor and the MLC requesting the City Council to amend the City’s Administrative Code was not successful. An amendment to the Administrative Code would allow the City to establish more than one benchmark for health insurance plans, requiring retirees who opt out of the Medicare Advantage Plan to pay the premium for the senior care program. The City has appealed the court’s latest decision and is awaiting the court’s ruling.\nPensions\nPension expenditures in the January 2023 Financial Plan are expected to remain relatively stable throughout the Plan period, averaging $9.6 billion. Included in the Plan are reserved amounts of $861 million in FY 2024, $1.97 billion in FY 2025, $3.02 billion in FY 2026, and $4.07 billion in FY 2027 to fund the additional costs to the pension systems due to the FY 2022 combined investment loss of 8.65 percent.[14] These funds were included in the November 2022 Financial Plan and are being held in reserve until the valuations of the pension funds are updated to reflect the FY 2022 investment loss and other demographic changes. No changes were made in the January 2023 Financial Plan.\nPension investments realized average returns of approximately 8 percent annually between FY 2013 and FY 2022. Pension costs to the City, however, increased steadily between FY 2013 and FY 2019 from $8.05 billion to $9.83 billion after incorporating wage increases associated with labor contracts and the updating of certain underlying assumptions used in the calculations of pension expenditures (See Chart 12). Revaluing the pension systems’ assets to reflect the market value as of June 30, 2019 helped reverse that trend with pension expenditures declining to $9.33 billion in FY 2021 before rising to $9.59 billion in FY 2022.[15] For FY 2023, pension expenditures are projected to decline to $9.30 billion before trending upward in FY 2024 through FY 2027, reflecting the impact of the FY 2022 investment loss.\nChart 12. City Pension Contributions FY 2013 – FY 2027\nNOTE: (1) Budgeted amounts for FYs 2023 – 2027 per January 2023 Financial Plan. (2) FY 2022 contributions to the pension systems were comprised of approximately 70 percent from City contributions, 12 percent from other employers’ contributions and 18 percent from member contributions.\nSOURCE: NYC Annual Comprehensive Financial Report of the Comptroller and NYC Office of Management and Budget\nPublic Assistance\nThrough January, the City’s public assistance caseload has averaged 438,793 recipients per month in FY 2023. Over the same July-January period in the prior year, caseload averaged only 373,879. The caseload average in the current year represents a 17.4 percent increase over the same period in FY 2022. As shown in Chart 13, the caseload spike comes on the heels of the end of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program in September 2021, which provided supplemental unemployment benefits dating back to the initial months of the COVID outbreak.[16]\nAccording to the Human Resources Administration, between September 2021 and January 2023, there was a 74 percent increase in the average number of applicants per month compared to the final month in FY 2021. For applications received between September 2021 and August 2022, the most recent month for which complete data is available, the average monthly case acceptance rate increased to 46 percent from 35 percent in June 2021.\nChart 13. Public Assistance Caseload and Monthly Changes, March 2020-January 2023\nSOURCE: NYC Department of Social Services\nThe City currently maintains internal caseload projections in the 440,000 range and baseline grants expenditure estimates of approximately $1.48 billion annually in FY 2023–FY 2026, before rising to $1.83 billion in FY 2027. Given the surge in both caseload and monthly grant spending over the past year, it appears likely that spending will stabilize at higher levels for the foreseeable future at a monthly rate of at least $145 million. At this rate, the City will likely need to provide additional funding of at least $125 million annually in FY 2023–FY 2026 to keep pace with its obligations for public assistance spending.\nDepartment of Education\nThe January Modification reflects a net increase of $248 million in the Department of Education (DOE) budget in the current year. For FY 2023, the DOE budget now totals $31.21 billion net of intra-city funds, representing a decline of about one percent or $269 million from actual FY 2022 spending of $31.48 billion.\nCompared to the November Plan, the bulk of the increase in the FY 2023 budget is attributable to a roll of $220 million in unspent FY 2022 stimulus funds. The City has utilized the Federal funds to indirectly increase its budget for special education Carter Cases spending, through a funding swap that frees up City funds previously allocated towards school custodial services. The remainder of the changes in the current year mainly consists of about $50 million in additional fuel and energy costs.\nThese increases are partly offset by PEG savings assigned to the DOE in the January Plan, consisting of $22 million from the reduction of vacant positions across various functions that grows to $42 million in FY 2024, with fringe benefits savings comprising more than one-third of the totals. Overall, PEG actions in the November 2022 and January 2023 Plans have reduced City support for the DOE budget by a combined $976 million – $176 million in the current year and $800 million in FY 2024. The significantly higher savings in FY 2024 is primarily attributable to a November Plan action to scale back expansion and supplant existing City funds with Federal stimulus money in the 3K for All program, culminating in a one-time City funds savings of $568 million, and a net budget decline of $284 million in FYs 2024 and 2025.[17]\nThe FY 2024 Preliminary Budget projects DOE spending of $30.73 billion, an increase of $37 million compared to the November Plan projections. Aside from the January Plan PEG savings, the City has incorporated the remaining $80 million from the roll of unspent FY 2022 stimulus funds in school budget allocations. Schools were provided certain register relief[18] from declining enrollments during the pandemic, which had been budgeted to ramp down from $375 million in FY 2022 to $160 million in FY 2023 and $80 million in FY 2024. This January Plan adjustment brings register relief in FY 2024 in line with the current FY 2023 projection of $160 million.[19]The January Plan does not assume any further register relief beyond FY 2024.\nUnder the State Executive Budget released in February, school formula aids would increase by $3.07 billion statewide in the next fiscal year. Against the January Plan State aid assumptions for DOE, the proposed formula aids increase would provide additional funding of $61 million in FY 2023 and $407 million in FY 2024. Foundation Aid, in the final year of a three-year phase-in to become fully funded for the first time, will rise by a historic $2.73 billion in the Governor’s proposal. Despite the record increase, the City would receive only 21 percent of the additional Foundation Aid. Comparatively speaking, the City’s Foundation Aid allocation would grow by 6.4 percent while the rest of the state will receive a 17.5 percent increase. As a result, the City’s share of statewide Foundation Aid would fall from 42 percent in SFY 2023 to slightly below 40 percent in SFY 2024.\nThe State Executive Budget also includes measures that could significantly increase the number of charter schools in the City. The Governor has proposed to lift the existing cap on the number of charter schools operating in the City and reauthorize slots that are currently taken up by defunct schools. According to the City, the two proposals could separately increase the number of charter schools by over 80 from the cap removal and more than 20 from renewed slots, potentially increasing annual DOE spending by $1 billion and up to $300 million, respectively, when fully phased-in. Similar to the class size reduction legislation enacted in 2022, the State is again seeking to impose new or expand existing mandates that seemingly target the New York City exclusively without providing new funding to help shoulder the additional costs.\nIn the outyears, the City projects the DOE budget to increase from $30.73 billion to $31.20 billion. Over this span, Federal stimulus funding under ARP-CRRSA education grants will continue to wind down, falling from $1.99 billion in FY 2023 to $1.75 billion in FY 2024 and then $246 million in FY 2025, before expiring in FY 2026. The reduced Federal support is offset mainly by higher level of City funds in the Plan, rising by $1.69 billion between FY 2023 and FY 2027, while State support is expected to grow by only $366 million across the same period.\nA significant number of risks to the DOE budget projections remain unaddressed in the January Plan, as shown in Table 33. The City indicates that unless the State provides dedicated funding to support charter school tuition rate increases, it could lead to potential funding shortfalls of $81 million in FY 2024, $133 million in FY 2025, $313 million in FY 2026, and $514 million in FY 2027. In addition, the City has underbudgeted spending for special education Carter Cases in each year of the Plan, which has nearly tripled over the past six years. In order to maintain baseline funding similar to the FY 2022 spending level of $918 million, the City will need to increase Carter Cases funding by an additional $255 million in FY 2023, even after the January plan adjustment mentioned above, and $475 million annually in FY 2024–FY 2027. Moreover, the DOE budget has likely underfunded pupil transportation costs in the outyears that could require additional City funding of $75 million beginning in FY 2024 growing to $225 million by FY 2027.\nThe City could also face risks for various core instructional and support initiatives upon the expiration of Federal COVID-19 grants. Chief among these are the underfunding of 3K programmatic costs by $93 million annually in FY 2026 and FY 2027, and respective needs of $176 million and $49 million for the continuation of Summer Rising and school nursing each year beginning in FY 2024. The City would also need to provide additional funding of $111 million in FY 2025 and $235 million annually in FY 2026 and FY 2027 as ongoing support of special education pre-kindergarten expansion, mental health, and community schools programs unless these initiatives can be phased out.\nIn addition, the January Plan does not include funding to address the State’s mandate to further lower class size caps in FY 2024 through FY 2027. The approved legislation would begin imposing the stricter class size limits, designated for New York City only, in the next school year. Under the plan, the City will need to phase-in the reductions over a five-year period and achieve full compliance by September 2028. The City estimates that, once fully implemented, the new mandate could impose additional costs reaching $1.3 billion annually. The State has the authority to withhold certain education aid receipts from the City unless stipulated conditions are met, which includes the submission of annual progress reports and implementation of corrective actions if needed. The bill also contains a provision forewarning the City that compliance with the plan will be taken into consideration in the determination of its Foundation Aid increases. The City indicates it would seek a change in the legislation that would limit the implementation of smaller class size caps to kindergarten through third grade only, as well as additional State assistance to help cover the new costs.\nTable 33. Projected Education-Related Risks to the January 2023 Financial Plan\n$ in millions, Negative numbers indicate risks to the Financial Plan, and increase the gap.\n| FY 2023 | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2026 | FY 2027 | |\n| Charter School Tuition | $0 | ($81) | ($133) | ($313) | ($514) |\n| Carter Cases | (255) | (475) | (475) | (475) | (475) |\n| Pupil Transportation | 0 | (75) | (125) | (175) | (225) |\n| Class Size Reduction Mandate | 0 | 0 | 0 | (433) | (867) |\n| 3K Expansion | 0 | 0 | 0 | (93) | (93) |\n| Special Ed Pre-K Expansion | 0 | 0 | (47) | (95) | (95) |\n| DOE Mental Health Services | 0 | 0 | (37) | (86) | (86) |\n| Community Schools Expansion and Sustainability | 0 | 0 | (27) | (54) | (54) |\n| Summer Rising | 0 | (176) | (176) | (176) | (176) |\n| DOE Contracted Nursing | 0 | (49) | (49) | (49) | (49) |\n| Total Education-Related Risks | ($255) | ($856) | ($1,069) | ($1,949) | ($2,634) |\nNOTE: Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.\nThe implementation of the mandate poses major logistical and financial challenges to the City. The $1.3 billion cost estimate does not include additional billions in capital spending that have yet to be quantified for the creation of new classroom space, as new schools and annexes will likely be needed in districts with more acute space shortages. Moreover, the mandate will require hiring a significant number of new teachers over the next several years. The DOE anticipates it would need to hire as many as 7,000 teachers in order to comply with the law. Given the system is already experiencing teacher shortages, hiring and retaining a quality pedagogical staff could evolve into a process that requires more extensive planning and coordination as well as new job incentives. The mandate could also have other unintended negative consequences such as the effect on school choice. As enrollment capacities for special programs narrow over time under the law (unless more programs are introduced), the admission process will become even more competitive for schools that are already strained by high numbers of applicants.\nHomeless Services and the Asylum Seeker Emergency\nNew York City has been confronted with an unprecedented surge of asylum seekers since the spring of 2022, which has had unexpected consequences for the City’s FY 2023 budget after it was adopted in June. Providing immediate shelter and services for these new arrivals has presented both operational and fiscal challenges for the City. In the longer run, these immigrants will face significant housing and income challenges due to their ineligibility for social safety net programs, lack of work opportunities due to their immigration status and current eligibility requirements, and insufficient affordable housing more generally.\nSince April, over 49,000[20] asylum seekers have passed through the City’s care. Initially the City responded to this need by standing up emergency shelters within the existing DHS shelter system. In October, the Mayor issued an Emergency Authorization designating the NYC Health and Hospitals (H+H) to operationalize Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Centers (HERRCs). While the HERRCs were initially envisioned as short-term intake and referral centers to welcome the new arrivals, they have instead become longer-term shelter for asylum seekers with nowhere else to turn.\nThere are currently 86 new emergency hotels that have been opened since April managed by the Department of Homeless Services, and 6 (soon to be 7) HERRCs run by H+H.\nChart 14 provides historical context for the extraordinary demand for shelter that has emerged since the beginning of 2023 and specifically delineates the population living in HERRCs.\nChart 14. Growth in the Shelter Census, FY 2014 – FY 2023\nSOURCE: Total individual shelter census on March 1st of each year as published by NYC Open Data. The 2023 HERRC population reflects the March 1 census number reported to the Comptroller’s Office by the Mayor’s Office.\nThe unique and potentially long-term nature of this new and persistent influx of shelter dwellers, coupled with a lack of Federal funding to assist the City in accommodating asylum seekers into its shelter system, has created tremendous fiscal uncertainty.\nThe Adopted Budget for FY 2023 for the Adult and Family Shelter Operation Divisions within DHS was $831 million and $1.1 billion respectively. The City added $600 million in the November Plan to the DHS budget to fund the 58 emergency shelters that DHS had opened as of that time. It also added $400 million, primarily to H+H, to operationalize the HERRCs, and to cover the projected costs for sheltering additional asylum seekers for the remainder of the year. The November Plan authorized funding for a total expense of $1 billion in FY 2023, with no funding in FY 2024 or the outyears. The $1 billion was predicated on an increase of approximately 34 households per day. Since then, the daily increase has fluctuated, at times well above that level.\nNo new funding was added in the January Plan, but OMB has stated that they anticipate the full cost for the asylum seekers to be approximately $1.4 billion in FY 2023 and $2.8 billion in FY 2024. The Comptroller’s Office can approximate these numbers by assuming a continued increase of approximately 65 households a day (the estimated average daily increase since August) for the remainder of FY 2023, and then holding the census flat for FY 2024.\nWithout knowing what will happen at the southern border (Title 42 is set to expire with the expiration of the Public Health Emergency in May, if not earlier), it is impossible to know if this is a reasonable assumption. When Title 42 expires, the influx could return to the mid-December level, and assuming no other interventions to reduce the flow of migrants at the border, these costs could easily grow well beyond the $2.8 billion estimate for next fiscal year.\nChart 15. Total Individuals in DHS Shelter and HERRC Facilities since April 2022\nSOURCE: NYC Open Data, NYC Mayor’s Office, Office of the NYC Comptroller\nThe per diem cost of emergency shelter will also likely remain at an elevated level throughout FY 2024 as the City continues to use emergency procurement, temporary staffing, and shorter-term contracts to operationalize the emergency hotels and HERRCs. Whether the per-unit costs can be brought down significantly with longer term planning is uncertain, particularly if census levels continue to rise.\nThe Comptroller’s Office is carrying an expense risk in line with OMB’s assumptions of $400 million in FY 2023 (the expected expense above the budgeted $1 billion) and $2.8 billion in FY 2024. If the census is able to stabilize, the City should move away from emergency response and procurement and the unit cost may revert back to the historical cost of providing shelter. The continued inflow of some level of new arrivals seems likely given the underlying causes in the home countries of the asylum seekers, significant uncertainty with Title 42 sunsetting, and the likelihood of a legal challenge to President Biden’s recently announced proposal to limit asylum seekers entering the country at the Southern border. Furthermore, without the availability of new affordable housing options in the city for those already being provided temporary shelter, it is likely that the homeless census will remain at elevated levels regardless of these external factors. The Comptroller’s Office is maintaining the risk at the FY 2024 level in the outyears.\nThe Federal and State governments, as noted earlier in the report, have indicated some financial support. The Federal government allocated $800 million in the Omnibus Reconciliation act for FEMA to reimburse localities for the costs of caring for asylum seekers. However, these funds are intended for all localities and the appropriations are for one year only. In FY 2023, the Comptroller’s Office anticipates federal reimbursement through FEMA grants of only $200 million for this purpose (compared to the $1 billion assumed in the Financial Plan). The Governor’s Executive Budget lays out a commitment to cover 29 percent of the shelter costs for asylum seekers, however the amount is capped at $1 billion over two years. The Governor did not extend this commitment into the outyears.\nRental Assistance\nIn addition, the January 2023 Financial Plan shows a significant drop in funding for the City’s rental assistance program. The Comptroller’s Office projects a risk of at least $237 million in City funds for the CityFHEPs (City Fighting Homelessness and Eviction Prevention Supplement) rental assistance program just to maintain prior year spending and the current vouchers already in use. There is likely to be further upward pressure on the rental assistance budget as more families require vouchers to exit the shelter system and with the shift to Federal Section 8 Fair Market Housing Rent levels. Proposed legislation to reduce requirements for longer term shelter residents (eliminating work requirements and enabling undocumented immigrants to access vouchers) is being considered by the City Council. Other legislation that would remove the shelter prioritization is also being considered, and would pose financial risks well beyond those stated here.\nNYC Health + Hospitals\nIn the January Plan update, the City projects NYC Health + Hospitals (H+H) will end the current fiscal year with a cash balance of $563 million. This estimate represents a decline of $187 million from the previous projection, mainly owing to a swing from a modest income of about $18 million in the FY 2023 Executive Budget to a current projected loss of nearly $144 million. For the FY 2024 Preliminary Budget, the City anticipates the year-end cash balance for H+H will continue retreating to $453 million.\nThe City projects the H+H budget will trend downward from $12.7 billion in FY 2022 to $10.6 billion in FY 2023 as the wind down of COVID-related activities continues, significantly reducing their impact on the FY 2023 budget. For the current year, the City has raised H+H’s revenue projection by a net $768 million that includes the recognition of increased third party revenues of $929 million, primarily from Supplemental Medicaid ($744 million) and managed care ($135 million) revenues, partly offset by a $180 million reduction in strategic revenue initiatives. The additional Supplemental Medicaid revenues are mainly due to revised timing of Upper Payment Limit (UPL) receipts previously anticipated in FY 2022. These revenue increases are eclipsed by $903 million in greater expenses. The higher spending mainly stems from the $763 million in other OTPS costs, which includes more than $300 million for oversight and operations of HERRCs for asylum seekers and over $150 million from delays of certain payments due to the City from the prior year. A more detailed discussion on the HERRCs appears in the Homeless Services and the Asylum Seeker Emergency section of this report.\nSimilarly, the City projects an operating loss of $110 million for H+H in the FY 2024 Preliminary Budget, leading to a lower expected cash balance of $453 million compared to the April 2022 Plan. The most notable element in the FY 2024 Preliminary Budget, projected at about $9.4 billion, is the anticipated cut of Supplemental Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) revenue. Unless the Federal government once again delays implementation, the cut would go into effect in October 2023 and reduce H+H baseline revenues by over $600 million annually beginning in FY 2024.\nCompared to prior estimates, the Preliminary Budget also reflects an increase of over $300 million in strategic revenue initiatives, which are almost in equal parts due to revised assumptions for ongoing UPL conversion and additional Federal and State actions needed to address the DSH revenue reduction. On the negative side, delayed Covid-19 related reimbursement and higher spending totaling $520 million more than offset revenue increases reflected in the latest update.\nOver the remainder of the Plan, H+H’s cash balance is anticipated to rise to $531 million in FY 2025 before resuming its decline to $300 million in FY 2026 and $12 million in FY 2026. These projections assume the continuation of DSH cuts, and therefore the outlook could improve significantly if the cuts are restored by Congress. Strategic initiatives, which have become a growing component in the H+H budget, will continue to hover around $2 billion annually during this span. About 80 percent of the total value of strategic initiatives during this span is comprised of revenue actions, with a significant portion dependent on Federal and State actions.\nIV. Capital Budget and Financing Program\nCapital Commitment Plan, FY 2023 – FY 2027\nAll-Funds Commitments\nThe January 2023 Capital Commitment Plan totals $96.55 billion in all-funds authorized commitments, a $551.2 million increase compared to the September 2022 Capital Plan over the same fiscal years. City-funds authorized commitments make up $92.29 billion of the total authorized commitments. After adjusting for the reserve for unattained commitments, all-funds planned commitments drop to $87.74 billion, as shown in Table 34. The City-funds commitments after adjusting for the reserve for unattained commitments drop to $83.48 billion. Twenty-two percent, or $21.46 billion, of the all-funds authorized commitments are scheduled for FY 2023. When adjusted for the reserve for unattained commitments, the percentage drops to 17 percent. In the outyears of the Plan, authorized commitments increase to $22.18 billion in FY 2024, then decrease to $19.01 billion in FY 2025, to $17.03 billion in FY 2026, and to $16.86 billion in FY 2027, resulting in an average authorized commitment amount of $19.31 billion per year over the period.\nTable 34.

Housing and Economic Development leads the way with 17.0 percent of the total, followed by DEP with 16.6 percent, Education and CUNY with 16.3 percent, and DOT and Mass Transit at 15.4 percent.\nThe increase of $551.2 million is a complicated mix of increases and decrease over 39 project types. The top three increases are for water pollution control related projects in the amount of $744 million, followed by an increase of $406 million for Sanitation related projects, and $263 million for citywide equipment, resiliency and energy efficiency projects. The top three decreases are in DOT related highway bridges projects of $988 million, Parks projects of $379 million, and DOT highways and street reconstruction projects of $225 million.\nThe remaining net increase of about $730 million over the period is comprised of increases for 20 project types totaling $1.12 billion, offset by a combined $387 million decrease in 11 other project types, along with two other project types with no change. Notable increases include DEP water supply projects in the amount of $202 million, and DEP water main-related projects of $175 million. Notable decreases are $115 million in cultural affairs-related projects and $64 million in CUNY projects.\nTen-Year Capital Strategy\nThe City is required by Sections 215 and 234 of the City Charter to issue a Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy (the Preliminary Strategy or PTYCS) every odd calendar year. The Preliminary Strategy for FY 2024–FY 2033 totals $159.33 billion — $155.45 billion in City-funds and $3.88 billion in non-City funds. This is an increase of $25.59 billion, or 19.1 percent, from the Ten-Year Capital Strategy (TYCS) published in April 2021, as shown in Table 35. The Preliminary Strategy increased by $26.16 billion in City funds but decreased by $575.8 million in non-City funds. The Preliminary Strategy is supported almost exclusively by City General Obligation (GO), Transitional Finance Authority (TFA), and New York Water Finance Authority financing, accounting for 97.6 percent of the total.\nTable 35.

However, this is an improvement from the April 2021 TYCS when the percentages were 57.4 and 68.1 percent, respectively. Consistent with past strategies, most of the commitments are for Education, DEP, housing (including NYCHA), economic development, and DOT projects, which together constitute 67.5 percent of the Capital Strategy. The categories with the largest changes from the April 2021 TYCS are DOT with an increase of $8.43 billion, housing with an increase of $7.92 billion, DEP with an increase of $6.38 billion, and the Parks Department with an increase of $3.13 billion as shown on Table 35. Offsetting these increases is a projected decrease of $4.80 billion in Education/CUNY related projects.\nThe increase in DOT is largely driven by a projected increase of $2.93 billion for bridge life extension projects and miscellaneous related work, $2.07 billion for capital improvements for bridges rated “fair,” and $1.72 billion for primary street reconstruction projects. The $7.92 billion increase in housing is primarily from a projected $3.52 billion increase for new housing, $1.34 billion for low to moderate income housing upgrades related to NYCHA, $1.22 billion for the preservation of existing housing, and $1.07 billion for special needs housing. DEP’s increase of $6.38 billion is comprised of $2.11 billion for sewer extensions to accommodate new development, $1.46 billion for water pollution control plant upgrades and reconstruction, and $903 million for the replacement and/or augmentation of existing sewers. The increase of $3.13 billion to the Parks Department is driven by the projected increase of $2.43 billion for neighborhood parks and playgrounds. The decrease in the January 2023 PTYCS from the April 2021 TYCS in the DOE/CUNY program area of $4.80 billion is due primarily to decreases of $2.39 billion for DOE new school system expansion, $1.34 billion in other system expansion alternatives, and $974 million in educational enhancement projects. CUNY, however, saw an increase of $246 million for miscellaneous construction projects.\nThe PTYCS is also categorized by service categories. This categorization places capital projects in broad infrastructure, equipment, vehicle, land, and facility categories. Just below 60 percent of the Capital Strategy is allocated in four of the eleven service categories for Road and Bridge Works, Public Building and Facilities, Housing, and Stormwater and Wastewater management as shown on Table 36. Planned commitments for Road and Bridge works sum to $29.66 billion, $16.37 billion (55.2 percent) of which are for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of bridges, highlighted by $9.76 billion for bridge useful life extension projects throughout the city, and $5.83 billion for the reconstruction of bridges rated “fair.” Major projects include $398 million for the Trans-Manhattan Expressway and $1.53 billion for the Brooklyn Queens Expressway (BQE) bridge related projects. Another 42.3 percent ($12.56 billion) of projected commitments for Road and Bridge works are allocated for street reconstruction and resurfacing, including $5.18 billion for primary street reconstruction, $3.55 billion for pedestrian ramp construction, and $3.80 billion for primary street resurfacing and sidewalk reconstruction. The remaining commitments for Roads and Bridge works are allocated for facilities reconstruction, bridge painting, East River bridges, traffic pavement markings, and lighting projects.\nWithin the Public Buildings and Facilities category, $6.84 billion of estimated commitments are for new borough-based jail facilities over FY 2024—2028,[21] followed by $6.32 billion for miscellaneous energy efficiency, sustainability, and retrofit projects, $2.67 billion for the reconstruction and renovation of court facilities, and $1.67 billion for building systems and infrastructure projects for the Department of Correction, and $1.40 billion for Department of Sanitation garages and facilities. Within the Housing category, projected commitments are directed primarily to new housing construction ($7.55 billion), preservation of existing housing stock ($5.4 billion), low to moderate income public housing construction and upgrades associated with NYCHA which include roof replacements, lead abatement, elevator rehabilitation, heating component upgrades, and pest mitigation ($4.36 billion), and special needs housing ($3.96 billion).\nTable 36.

The top three items in the Educational Facilities category are the rehabilitation of school components with a projected $7.72 billion, new school construction or expansion with $3.20 billion, and emergency, inspection, and miscellaneous projects with $3.18 billion. Within the Equipment and Technology category, the major items include $3.48 billion for data processing equipment along with $2.23 billion for Sanitation trucks and other equipment. Within Water Supply and Treatment, the highlights are trunk and distribution water main extensions and replacements in the amount of $2.75 billion, the Kensico City tunnel project with $1.81 billion, and $1.77 billion for various water quality preservation projects.\nParks and Open Spaces are led by $4.02 billion for neighborhood parks and playground related projects, followed by $2.36 billion for large, major, and regional park reconstruction projects, and $1.49 billion for major recreational facilities and facility projects. Community Facilities related projects include a variety of H+H’s routine reconstruction projects in the amount of $3.09 billion, along with $1.43 billion for the essential reconstruction of facilities for cultural institutions, and $1.34 billion allocated to the four library systems largely for state of good repair work.\nNotable projects in the Economic Development and Mass Transit categories include $1.67 billion for miscellaneous economic development projects related to program expansion, $1.31 billion for neighborhood revitalization, $1.15 billion for commercial development, $2.06 billion for track and other miscellaneous improvements related to New York City Transit, and $529 million for DOT related ferry boat upgrades and terminal reconstruction work.\nIn addition to the Service Categories noted above, capital commitments in the Preliminary strategy are also allocated among three “lifecycle” project categories: state of good repair (SOGR), which involves maintaining and repairing facilities and infrastructure, program expansion, which involves adding new or expanding current facilities and infrastructure, and programmatic replacement, which involves replacing facilities or equipment. More than half of the commitments, $87.29 billion (54.8 percent), are allocated for state of good repair, followed by $37.46 billion (23.5 percent) for program expansion, and $34.59 billion (21.7 percent) for programmatic replacement as shown in Table 36.\nIn the SOGR category, Road and Bridge Works, Educational Facilities, Public Buildings and Facilities, constitute just less than 66 percent, or $57.29 billion of commitments within the SOGR; with commitments for Educational Facilities and Road and Bridge Works totaling more than $43.52 billion combined. These SOGR projected commitments account for over 76 percent of planned commitments for Educational Facilities and the entirety of planned commitments for Road and Bridge Works.\nWithin the program expansion category, the service categories of Housing, Stormwater and Wastewater, Water Supply and Treatment, and Economic Development projects constitute over 85 percent of the total. Major anticipated capital commitments include $7.55 billion for new housing construction, $3.96 billion for special needs housing, and $3.40 billion of sewer extensions to accommodate new construction.\nWithin the programmatic replacement category, the service categories of Equipment and Technology, Public Buildings and Facilities, and Stormwater and Wastewater projects make up 82.9 percent of the total. Projected capital commitments include $6.84 billion for the design and construction of new borough-based jail facilities, $6.60 billion for upgrades to water pollution control plants, $3.15 billion for water main replacement and dam safety programs at DEP, and $3.48 billion for citywide information systems and equipment.[22]\nThe January 2023 PTYCS continues to be primarily financed by City bonds – General Obligation (GO) and Transitional Finance Authority Future Tax Secured (TFA FTS) – with an estimated $127.03 billion in anticipated local tax-supported borrowing, or 79.7 percent of the Strategy. Municipal Water Finance Authority (NYW) debt is expected to fund $28.42 billion, or 17.8 percent of the Strategy. The remaining 2.4 percent, about $3.88 billion, will be funded with Federal ($3.04 billion), State ($604.2 million), and other non-City sources ($236 million) as shown in Table 37.\nTable 37.

Numbers may not tie due to rounding.\nFinancing Program\nTotal projected borrowing in the January 2023 Financial Plan for FY 2023 through FY 2027 is $62.35 billion. For the period FY 2023-2026, the January 2023 Plan is $1.28 billion less than the November 2022 Financial Plan’s estimate.[23] This is a result of decreases of $1.24 billion in GO borrowing, $335 million in Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) Future Tax Secured (FTS) borrowing, with an increase of $287 million in New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority (NYW) borrowing over the period. The reduction in overall borrowing, despite the modest increase of $551 million in capital commitments from the September 2022 Capital Plan, stems primarily from $1.38 billion of commitment deferrals from FY 2023 and FY 2024 to the outyears and the expected additional capital proceeds from bond premiums in FY 2023.[24] Estimated total borrowing ranges from $9.23 billion in FY 2023 to $14.98 billion in FY 2027, with an annual average of $12.47 billion over the period, down from $12.73 billion per year in the November 2022 Financial Plan. Excluding NYW borrowing, the GO/TFA borrowing averages are $10.60 billion per year in the January 2023 Plan over FY 2023–FY 2027, compared with $10.92 billion per year in the November 2022 Financial Plan.\nTable 38.

In addition, these estimates for debt-service represent an estimated annual average percent increase of 6.2 percent. These projections exclude debt service of the NYW, which is backed by water and sewer user fees, and the debt service of TFA BARBs, supported by State building aid.\nTable 39.

GO debt service projected savings over the Plan period are derived almost exclusively from the decrease in estimated borrowing over the period resulting in debt service savings of $52 million in FY 2024, $71 million in FY 2025, $81 million in FY 2026, and $88 million in FY 2027. Projected TFA debt service reductions over the Plan period are similarly driven by reduced projected borrowing, albeit less dramatic, in the amount of $2 million in FY 2024, $9 million in FY 2025, $18 million in FY 2026, and $24 million in FY 2027. These savings are in the City’s PEG program and are additive to the PEG savings for debt-service savings presented in the November 2022 Plan.\nDebt Affordability\nDebt affordability continues to be an important topic facing the City. Debt service as a percent of local tax revenues and as a percent of total-funds revenues are widely used measures of debt affordability.[27] In FY 2022, the City’s debt service was 9.7 percent of local tax revenues, a continuation of FY 2021’s historically low percentage. The January 2023 Plan projects debt service will consume 11.1 percent of local tax revenues in FY 2023, 11.5 percent in FY 2024, 11.8 percent in FY 2025, 12.6 percent in FY 2026, and 13.4 percent in FY 2027 as shown in Chart 16. The upward trend in the debt service to tax revenue ratio reflects the disparity between debt service and tax revenue growth rates over the Financial Plan period. Debt service is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 6.3 percent[28] from FY 2023 to FY 2027 while tax revenue during this period is projected to grow 1.5 percent annually. Beyond FY 2027 the ratio is estimated to reach 14.8 percent by FY 2033, below the 15 percent threshold for debt-service affordability. OMB’s assumed tax revenue growth is 3.6 percent per year over the FY 2027 to FY 2033 period. If this assumed rate is less than projected, the ratio could possibly exceed the 15 percent mark. However, in past Ten-Year Capital Strategies which contain a ten-year outlook for debt service, it is often the case that the debt-service to tax revenue ratio is estimated to approach but not exceed 15 percent.\nChart 16. NYC Debt Service as a Percent of Tax Revenues\nSOURCE: Office of the NYC Comptroller, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, FY 1992 – FY 2022 and NYC Office of Management and Budget, FY 2023 January Plan and FY 2024 Preliminary Budget\nDebt service as a percent of total revenues was 6.2 percent in FY 2022. Due to the drop in total revenues in FY 2023, the January 2023 Plan projects that debt service as a percent of total revenues will be 7.3 percent in FY 2023, 7.8 percent in FY 2024, 7.9 percent in FY 2025, 8.5 percent in FY 2026, and 8.9 percent in FY 2027. This is driven by a 6.2 percent annual growth rate in debt service compared to a growth rate in revenues of 1.1 percent over the same period.\nChart 17.

The inflation adjustment uses NY CPI-U less shelter. Taxable sales data are not seasonally adjusted.\n[7] According to the NYS Department of Taxation and Finance who administers the City’s PIT, the anomaly is related to the accounting treatment of NYS Pass-Through Entity Tax (PTET) credit toward NYS PIT. PTET is discussed in more detail in the NYC Comptroller’s recent The State of the City’s Economy and Finances report.\n[8] Alternative, more optimistic revenue estimates are available from the NYC Independent Budget Office and the NYC Council.\n[9] Miscellaneous revenue analysis excludes intra-city revenues. Water and sewer revenues are mostly payments from the New York City Water Board for the operation and maintenance of the water delivery and sewer systems and are not available for general operating purposes.\n[10] OMB had provided an earlier estimate of $111 million in FY 2024 and $265 million in FY 2025, which was based on an earlier proposal with broader implications.\n[11] See the Comptroller’s February spotlight for a fuller description of the Governor’s minimum wage proposal, and a comparison to the Raise Up NY bill: https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/Spotlight-Minimum-Wage.pdf\n[12] The Health Insurance Stabilization Fund created in the mid 1980s paid the difference between the GHI and HIP health insurance premiums, essentially protecting employees and retirees from paying more to be covered by GHI. Currently, the City contributes $35 million to the fund annually. For several fiscal years, the GHI premium was lower than the HIP premium leading to a higher than anticipated balance in the fund. Over time, the City and unions were able to draw from the fund balance to offset wage increases and other benefits for employees. In recent years, however, GHI health insurance premiums have been about equal or higher than HIP premiums. This has led to a reduction in the balance of the fund and the likelihood that the fund will not be able to meet obligations in coming fiscal years.\n[13] Administrative Code of the city of New York section 12-126 (b) (1).\n[14] Investment gains or losses above or below the actuarial interest rate assumption (AIRA) of 7 percent will decrease or increase pension expenditures by similar amounts beginning the second fiscal year following the given fiscal year returns.\n[15] Due to the phasing in of investment gains or losses above or below the AIRA, the value of the pension assets, referred to as the actuarial assets, used in determining the required employer contributions do not equal exactly to the market value of assets. The Chief Actuary may choose at a given point in time to revalue the actuarial pension assets to equal the market value of assets.\n[16] A more detailed review of NYC pandemic aid can be found in the January 2023 Economic Newsletter.\n[17] The net impact of the Federal funding shift and City funding changes reduced 3K programmatic funding from $996 million to $712 million in the November Plan for both FY 2024 and FY 2025. The funding baseline for the 3K program then falls further to $619 million annually in FY 2026 and FY 2027.\n[18] School budgets are funded through a Fair Student Funding formula based on the number of students, assigning greater weights for students with various needs. Given the enrollment decline during the pandemic, schools with register losses were set to face drastic cuts. The City used stimulus funds to hold schools harmless from these cuts and brought certain school budgets in line with pre-pandemic levels (known as register relief).\n[19] Subsequent to the release of the January Plan, the DOE has internally allocated an additional $136 million in ARPA funds to school budgets for register relief in the current year, bringing total register relief funding to $296 million in FY 2023.\n[20] As of March 1, 2023, the City reports that over 49,000 asylum seekers have gone through the system and been offered a place to sleep since last Spring.\n[21] $891 million of planned commitments for borough based jail facilities reside in FY 2023 and actual commitments to date are about $500 million.\n[22] Given the current inflationary environment, there is the potential for higher construction costs for the new Borough Based Jails planned in the four boroughs. In addition, meeting the initial 2026 deadline for completion of the four facilities is unlikely.\n[23] The changes are measured from FY 2023-2026 as FY 2027 was not contained in the November 2022 Financial Plan.\n[24] When the City issues bonds with coupon rates that exceed current market rates for the associated principal maturity, the computed bond proceeds will exceed the face (par) value of the issued bond.

How do we know Syria has possessed chemical weapons?\nIt was Syria's own Foreign Ministry that confirmed in 2012 that the nation held chemical weapons, many of them developed in the 1970s with help from the former Soviet Union and Egypt. A spokesman for the ministry vowed the weapons were intended to defend the country against \"external aggression\" and would never be used against the Syrian people.\n2. Wasn't the elimination of those weapons required under the CWC?\nBoth production facilities and the chemical weapons themselves were to be destroyed. The Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, through on-site inspections and unfettered access, was responsible for \"stringent verification\" that the terms of the treaty would be observed.\n3. How would the OPCW know which chemical weapons existed and where they were located in Syria?\nIn 2013 the Syrian government provided the U.S. and Russia what was supposed to have been a comprehensive listing of all the chemical weapons in its possession and their location. The recurring chemical weapons attacks in Syria since then could possibly have been facilitated by:\n- omissions in that listing\n- the manufacture of new chemical weapons in secret facilities\n- lack of inspections because of warfare\n- additional chemical weapons supplied by an ally of Syria's\n4. Didn't the CWC also call for the elimination of chemical weapons worldwide?\nThat is the aim of the CWC, and 190 nations have ratified the treaty. Four have not: Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan. Others have long surpassed the 10-year window following ratification during which their chemical weapons stockpiles were to be destroyed. The U.S. ratified the CWC 21 years ago this month, but as of December 2015, it had not yet destroyed about 10 percent of the 27,771 metric tons it declared, including sarin and mustard gas.\n5. Is the chlorine gas allegedly used in the latest attack banned under the CWC?\nUsing chlorine as a weapon is banned, but chlorine itself is not proscribed by the CWC. Unlike other substances that fall under the treaty, such as sarin and mustard gas, chlorine is also produced and used in Syria for peaceful purposes, from cleaning products to water purification. It was not included on the list of banned chemical agents in the deal made with the U.S. and Russia.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Four years ago, it almost looked as if chemical attacks on Syrian civilians would stop. “We struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out,” declared then-Secretary of State John Kerry on Meet the Press in 2014. Kerry was referring to Bashar al-Assad’s declared stockpiles of chemical weapons which, under a 2013 deal struck by the Obama administration following a sarin nerve gas attack that brought the U.S. to the brink of striking Syrian government forces, were dismantled and shipped out of the country.\nBut there were two important and deadly loopholes. The first was that Assad did not declare everything—a reality that Kerry acknowledged publicly, including in a farewell memo to staff, in which he wrote that “unfortunately other undeclared chemical weapons continue to be used ruthlessly against the Syrian people.” The second was that chlorine gas, which has legitimate civilian uses, was not part of the deal. The Syrian American Medical Society and the White Helmets civil-defense group have documented 200 chemical attacks in Syria since 2012, many involving chlorine. On Saturday, the group alleged a particularly gruesome attack in the besieged city of Douma, which has reportedly killed dozens and injured hundreds. It remains unclear exactly what chemical weapon was involved in the alleged attack.\nThe deal’s failure to prevent attacks like this was evident even before last April, when sarin gas killed roughly 100 people in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun. By then, Assad’s renewed campaign of chemical attacks, involving the use of chlorine in barrel bombs, was well underway. But sarin was explicitly prohibited, and those weapons were supposed to be out of the country. The deal, The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg wrote at the time, “was not a complete failure, in that [chemical-weapons] stockpiles were indeed removed, but Assad kept enough of these weapons to allow him to continue murdering civilians with sarin gas. The argument that Obama achieved comprehensive WMD disarmament without going to war is no longer, as they say in Washington, operative.”\nWhat the deal did achieve, according to Avril Haines, who served as Obama’s deputy national security adviser, was to force Syria to declare 1,300 tons of chemical weapons, which were then destroyed. “This was a major achievement and one that has put us in a better position to address the threat posed by [Assad] … we have learned a great deal about Syria's holdings and capabilities” because the regime was effectively forced to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, she wrote in an email.\nIf all this added up to something short of disarmament, Trump’s strikes on regime targets following last April’s sarin attack haven’t achieved it either. The seeming logic of that response—that where diplomacy had failed, punishment might succeed—also fell apart quickly, as reports began emerging soon afterward that Assad was once again using chlorine gas against civilians. The United States did not strike Assad again in retaliation. And on Saturday, the Syrian American Medical Society and the White Helmets noted that dozens of victims in Douma were exhibiting the symptoms of chemical exposure—including seizures and foaming at the mouth.\nPresident Trump has labeled the event “an atrocity,” blaming the Obama administration for declining to enforce its declared “red line” against chemical weapons use in 2013. But if anything, until this morning it looked like the Trump administration was more interested in extricating itself from Syria entirely. The attacks follow a strange few days in Washington, as the president stated his desire to get out of Syria “very soon;” his advisers insisted the U.S. was staying to finish the job of defeating the Islamic State; and the White House tried to resolve the contradiction by insisting that American troops would stay in Syria until ISIS was gone, an outcome that was rapidly coming to pass.\nSyrian civilians appeared virtually nowhere in that discussion; nowhere was the U.S. mission defined as protecting them. As when a sarin attack killed a thousand people in Ghouta in 2013; as when another one killed roughly 100 last April; as with this latest reported attack; the administration seems to take up that public discussion seriously only when dozens of people—men, women, children—have already choked to death in their homes.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        On August 20, 2012, then-President Barack Obama told a group of reporters the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria would cross his “red line.” A year later, almost to the day, Syrian forces killed more than 1,400 people with sarin gas, a particularly horrifying chemical weapon that can cause paralysis, convulsions, or death.\nHow Obama’s “red line” fiasco led to Trump bombing Syria\nThanks, Obama.\nObama didn’t respond immediately. Instead, a month later, he agreed to a deal with Russia to remove and destroy 600 metric tons of Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile. That would, in theory, make it impossible for Assad to gas his own people, though he could still kill them using conventional weapons.\nObama and his second secretary of state, John Kerry, hailed the accord as a historic way to end Assad’s chemical weapons program without firing a single shot. “It turns out we’re getting chemical weapons out of Syria without having initiated a strike,” Obama told an audience in the Philippines four years ago. “With respect to Syria, we struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out,” Kerry stated during a July 2014 appearance on Meet the Press.\nFour years after Kerry’s Syria comments, President Donald Trump, along with allies France and the UK, launched 105 missiles on Friday at three Syrian targets to punish the regime for killing more than 40 people in an April 7, 2018, chlorine attack. That was the second time Trump authorized strikes on Syria after a chemical attack.\nClearly, Assad kept some of his stockpile and continued to use chemicals with nonmilitary uses — like chlorine, which can cause respiratory problems — on his people. Human Rights Watch has cataloged about 85 chemical weapons attacks in Syria since the August 21, 2013, strike, most of them perpetrated by the regime.\nThat makes one thing very clear: Assad’s continued use of chemical weapons offers even more evidence of how badly the Obama administration misjudged and mishandled the “red line” moment. It’s one of the biggest problems Obama left for the current occupant of the Oval Office.\nObama-era officials, however, still think the deal was a success. “We enforced the red line diplomatically, not militarily, and far more effectively than if we had used force,” Antony Blinken, a top Obama State Department and White House official, told me. “The subsequent use of chemical weapons by the regime shows that had we proceeded with the limited strike in 2013, it probably would not have deterred future use,” he said.\nTrump, however, has opted to use force. Crucially, he didn’t respond to every chemical attack in Syria, although he vows now to keep the pressure on Assad. “We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents,” he said from the White House on Friday night.\nIt’s unclear what effect, if any, Trump’s missile strikes will have on Assad’s ability and willingness to use chemical weapons again. But the fact that Trump has to deal with Assad’s chemical weapons program at all shows Obama’s bet didn’t pay off.\nWhy Obama didn’t attack Syria\nThe Long Game, former top Obama national security official Derek Chollet’s 2016 book about Obama’s foreign policy, outlined the last administration’s reasons for not bombing Syria. “[T]here were many concerns about the danger to American pilots (Syria had one of the most sophisticated air defense networks in the world), as well as the possibility of escalation. Everyone understood the risks,” he wrote. “There was no question the US had the capability to act decisively, but there was deep uncertainty about where military intervention would lead.”\nAnd as Obama himself said in an April 2016 interview with Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic, attacking Syria might eventually force America’s long-term involvement in the civil war. That made him hesitant to intervene.\nTrump’s two operationally successful military attacks, however, put a massive dent in that argument. First, the US carried out both strikes without losing any troops or equipment. Second, the feared Syrian air defense system proved feckless against Western airpower, shooting roughly 40 missiles after the US-led attack last Friday. Third, Trump’s strikes were limited and for now have not provoked a broader conflict with Assad’s backers in Syria, Russia, and Iran.\nThat’s not to say Trump’s strikes have done much to date. “I do not expect the strike to change Assad’s behavior,” Randa Slim, a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute, told me. “He will use chemical weapons again when his forces are cornered and are unable to clear territory,” she continued, adding that “Assad never felt threatened” by Friday’s attack.\nMara Karlin, a former top Obama Pentagon official, told me that strikes like Trump’s “can be done” because they are “not operationally difficult. The question is why and for what purpose?”\nIt’s therefore not fair to say Trump’s two attacks in two years have succeeded in stopping Assad — far from it. But it is fair to say Obama didn’t change anything either.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings.

COVID-19-related delays and prioritizing the delivery of the apportionment results delayed the Census Bureau’s original plan to deliver the redistricting data to the states by March 31, 2021.\nDifferent from previous censuses, the Census Bureau will deliver the data for all states at once, instead of on a flow basis. This change has been made because of COVID-19-related shifts in data collection and in the data processing schedule and it enables the Census Bureau to deliver complete and accurate redistricting data in a more timely fashion overall for the states.\nThe redistricting data includes counts of population by race, ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino origin), voting age, housing occupancy status, and group quarters population, all at the census block level. This is the information that states need to redraw or “redistrict” their legislative boundaries.\nIn preparation for the delivery of redistricting data products, the Census Bureau has been in close coordination with each states’ official nonpartisan liaisons to understand the impacts of the delayed delivery on individual states. Since 2019, states have had access to prototype geographic support products and data tabulations from the 2018 Census Test to help them begin to design their redistricting systems. This is one tool states can use to help minimize the impact of schedule delays. In addition, the Census Bureau today completed the release of all states’ 2020 Census geographic products needed for redistricting. This will enable states to redistrict promptly upon receipt of their 2020 Census tabulation data.\n###\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Thank you very much. Thank you and good evening. The sponsor has been identified, but unlike most television programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script. As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks.\nI have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines. Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used, \"We've never had it so good.\"\nBut I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future. No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income. Today, 37 cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector's share, and yet our government continues to spend 17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in. We haven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years. We've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months, and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world. We have 15 billion dollars in gold in our treasury; we don't own an ounce. Foreign dollar claims are 27.3 billion dollars. And we've just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its total value.\nAs for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely. Do they mean peace, or do they mean we just want to be left in peace? There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us. We're at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars, and it's been said if we lose that war, and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening. Well I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the Founding Fathers.\nNot too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to a Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said, \"We don't know how lucky we are.\" And the Cuban stopped and said, \"How lucky you are? I had someplace to escape to.\" And in that sentence he told us the entire story. If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth.\nAnd this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man.\nThis is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.\nYou and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There's only an up or down - [up] man's old-aged dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course.\nIn this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the \"Great Society,\" or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people. But they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print. These are not Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that say, \"The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism.\" Another voice says, \"The profit motive has become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state.\" Or, \"Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century.\" Senator Fullbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the President as \"our moral teacher and our leader,\" and he says he is \"hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document.\" He must \"be freed,\" so that he \"can do for us\" what he knows \"is best.\" And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as \"meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government.\"\nWell, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as \"the masses.\" This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, \"the full power of centralized government\"this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.\nNow, we have no better example of this than government's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since 1955, the cost of this program has nearly doubled. One-fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85 percent of the farm surplus. Three-fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21 percent increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce. You see, that one-fourth of farming that's regulated and controlled by the federal government. In the last three years we've spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow.\nSenator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater, as President, would seek to eliminate farmers. He should do his homework a little better, because he'll find out that we've had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government programs. He'll also find that the Democratic administration has sought to get from Congress [an] extension of the farm program to include that three-fourths that is now free. He'll find that they've also asked for the right to imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government. The Secretary of Agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals. And contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove 2 million farmers from the soil.\nAt the same time, there's been an increase in the Department of Agriculture employees. There's now one for every 30 farms in the United States, and still they can't tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for Austria disappeared without a trace and Billie Sol Estes never left shore.\nEvery responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy, but how - who are farmers to know what's best for them? The wheat farmers voted against a wheat program. The government passed it anyway. Now the price of bread goes up; the price of wheat to the farmer goes down.\nMeanwhile, back in the city, under urban renewal the assault on freedom carries on. Private property rights [are] so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few government planners decide it should be. In a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy, we see such spectacles as in Cleveland, Ohio, a million-and-a-half-dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed to make way for what government officials call a \"more compatible use of the land.\" The President tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands, where heretofore we've only built them in the hundreds. But FHA [Federal Housing Authority] and the Veterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure. For three decades, we've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning, and the more the plans fail, the more the planners plan. The latest is the Area Redevelopment Agency.\nThey've just declared Rice County, Kansas, a depressed area. Rice County, Kansas, has two hundred oil wells, and the 14,000 people there have over 30 million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks. And when the government tells you you're depressed, lie down and be depressed.\nWe have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one. So they're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning. Well, now, if government planning and welfare had the answer - and they've had almost 30 years of it - shouldn't we expect government to read the score to us once in a while? Shouldn't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help? The reduction in the need for public housing?\nBut the reverse is true. Each year the need grows greater; the program grows greater. We were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry each night. Well that was probably true. They were all on a diet. But now we're told that 9.3 million families in this country are poverty-stricken on the basis of earning less than 3,000 dollars a year. Welfare spending [is] 10 times greater than in the dark depths of the Depression. We're spending 45 billion dollars on welfare. Now do a little arithmetic, and you'll find that if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9 million poor families, we'd be able to give each family 4,600 dollars a year. And this added to their present income should eliminate poverty. Direct aid to the poor, however, is only running only about 600 dollars per family. It would seem that someplace there must be some overhead.\nNow, so now we declare \"war on poverty,\" or \"You, too, can be a Bobby Baker.\" Now do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion we're spending, one more program to the 30-odd we have -and remember, this new program doesn't replace any, it just duplicates existing programs - do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic? Well, in all fairness I should explain there is one part of the new program that isn't duplicated. This is the youth feature. We're now going to solve the dropout problem, juvenile delinquency, by reinstituting something like the old CCC camps [Civilian Conservation Corps], and we're going to put our young people in these camps. But again we do some arithmetic, and we find that we're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help 4,700 dollars a year. We can send them to Harvard for 2,700! Course, don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting Harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency.\nBut seriously, what are we doing to those we seek to help? Not too long ago, a judge called me here in Los Angeles. He told me of a young woman who'd come before him for a divorce. She had six children, was pregnant with her seventh. Under his questioning, she revealed her husband was a laborer earning 250 dollars a month. She wanted a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise. She's eligible for 330 dollars a month in the Aid to Dependent Children Program. She got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who'd already done that very thing.\nYet anytime you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals. They say we're always \"against\" things - we're never \"for\" anything.\nWell, the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so.\nNow, we're for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age, and to that end we've accepted Social Security as a step toward meeting the problem.\nBut we're against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood. They've called it \"insurance\" to us in a hundred million pieces of literature. But then they appeared before the Supreme Court and they testified it was a welfare program. They only use the term \"insurance\" to sell it to the people. And they said Social Security dues are a tax for the general use of the government, and the government has used that tax. There is no fund, because Robert Byers, the actuarial head, appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that Social Security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole. But he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax, they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble. And they're doing just that.\nA young man, 21 years of age, working at an average salary - his Social Security contribution would, in the open market, buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65. The government promises 127. He could live it up until he's 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than Social Security. Now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a sound basis, so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they're due, that the cupboard isn't bare?\nBarry Goldwater thinks we can.\nAt the same time, can't we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non-earning years? Should we not allow a widow with children to work, and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband? Shouldn't you and I be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program, which we cannot do? I think we're for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds. But I think we're against forcing all citizens, regardless of need, into a compulsory government program, especially when we have such examples, as was announced last week, when France admitted that their Medicare program is now bankrupt. They've come to the end of the road.\nIn addition, was Barry Goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate, planned inflation, so that when you do get your Social Security pension, a dollar will buy a dollar's worth, and not 45 cents worth?\nI think we're for an international organization, where the nations of the world can seek peace. But I think we're against subordinating American interests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound that today you can muster a two-thirds vote on the floor of the General Assembly among nations that represent less than 10 percent of the world's population. I think we're against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony, while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the Soviet colonies in the satellite nations.\nI think we're for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs, but we're against doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy, if not socialism, all over the world. We set out to help 19 countries. We're helping 107. We've spent 146 billion dollars. With that money, we bought a 2 million dollar yacht for Haile Selassie. We bought dress suits for Greek undertakers, extra wives for Kenya[n] government officials. We bought a thousand TV sets for a place where they have no electricity. In the last six years, 52 nations have bought 7 billion dollars worth of our gold, and all 52 are receiving foreign aid from this country.\nNo government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. So governments' programs, once launched, never disappear.\nActually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.\nFederal employees - federal employees number two and a half million; and federal, state, and local, one out of six of the nation's work force employed by government. These proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards. How many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant? They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work.\nLast February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket, said, \"If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States.\" I think that's exactly what he will do.\nBut as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died, because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.\nNow it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the, or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.\nOur Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men - that we're to choose just between two personalities.\nWell what of this man that they would destroy, and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been privileged to know him \"when.\" I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.\nThis is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there.\nAn ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that [there were] a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, \"Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such,\" and they went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.\nDuring the hectic split-second timing of a campaign, this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer. His campaign managers were understandably impatient, but he said, \"There aren't many left who care what happens to her. I'd like her to know I care.\" This is a man who said to his 19-year-old son, \"There is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness, and when you begin to build your life on that rock, with the cement of the faith in God that you have, then you have a real start.\" This is not a man who could carelessly send other people's sons to war. And that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems I've discussed academic, unless we realize we're in a war that must be won.\nThose who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory. They call their policy \"accommodation.\" And they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us. All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers to complex problems. Well, perhaps there is a simple answer - not an easy answer but simple: If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right.\nWe cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, \"Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters.\" Alexander Hamilton said, \"A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one.\" Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second - surrender.\nAdmittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face, that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand, the ultimatum. And what then, when Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for \"peace at any price\" or \"better Red than dead,\" or as one commentator put it, he'd rather \"live on his knees than die on his feet.\" And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us.\nYou and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin - just in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all.\nYou and I have the courage to say to our enemies, \"There is a price we will not pay.\" \"There is a point beyond which they must not advance.\" And this - this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater's \"peace through strength.\" Winston Churchill said, \"The destiny of man is not measured by material computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits - not animals.\" And he said, \"There's something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty.\"\nYou and I have a rendezvous with destiny.\nWe'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.\nWe will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwater has faith in us. He has faith that you and I have the ability and the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny.\nThank you very much.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        3/24/10\nDear Mr. President.\nI am writing you this letter in concern for the economy, my family, and my home. I am a 35 year old mother of 1 little boy who is 5. I have a concern that I need you to hear from an average family trying to make it through these hard times. I do not expect that anything will be done, but I do want you to hear how we are struggling.\nI was laid off in June from a job that I was at for 8 years making a pretty substantial salary. My husband, who was an electrician, has been laid off since September of 2008. He was called back to work in July 2009 but only worked for about 2 months before his company laid him off again and he has been out of work ever since. I was only able to land myself a temporary job that my new boss is struggling to make permanent. We do not have any insurance for our son and we are living off of my salary which is about 10K less a year and unemployment. We struggle living week to week to pay our mortgage- which was underwritten to a smaller amount so that we do not have to let our house go into foreclosure. I want you to have a good idea of the history of events that have occurred with our bank and credit.\nWe refinanced our mortgage in 2006 thinking we could get a leg up on some of our credit card bills and also invest more money into our home. When we refinanced with our bank they did not set up an escrow account - which they did not tell us. When we figured it out - they basically told us it was too late. So that said, we have been struggling to pay our taxes but we have taken out a 401K my husband had and we paid our taxes through July of last year. We have had some hard times through our marriage which ended up costing us more in credit card debt. We have now reconciled and are also struggling to pay that as well. We have received letters through the mail that say that this is part of your plan to help America reduce their debt so we signed a contract with a company that pay every month which should in the end reduce the overall payment of our credit cards for a settlement. Since we have done that we have received numerous creditor calls and letters, and judgments against us- which has completely ruined our credit overall so far. We have no future, only weekly income!\nSo now, it's tax time. Since we were both laid off for a good amount of time in 2009 and that my husband was laid off for the majority of 2009 we now owe in taxes- on top of the taxes that we already owe. I ask you - how we are supposed to pay that? How do you expect anyone that has been laid off to pay any of their taxes when there are no jobs to help alleviate that? Why do you offer to take taxes out when someone applies for unemployment? Being used to a cost of living expense and having to even reduce that to an unemployment paycheck you want to receive as much money as you are eligible for to make up for the money you are used to receiving. Just put yourself in our shoes?\nEveryone I know who voted for you is now turning the other direction, but I have faith in you and that you will do what you can to turn this around, in the meantime I am struggling with the fact that we may need to just walk away from our home to alleviate the stress of paying for this home and on top of that I am trying to go back to school online to better myself and hopefully in the long run better my family.\nMy son is the one who is receiving the short end of the stick here as it has been stressful on him as well. We end up taking it out on him or he just wants to make things better for us by spending his time making money out of paper and giving it to us. Thinking it will help.... HE's FIVE years old!!! I have seen you in office for over a year now and I want to know what you can do to help us- the average family just trying to get back on our feet, live our lives like Americans should and not have to feel like we are constantly struggling. You say you read these - at least 10 a day- and I am sure there are other families struggling just the same if not worse, but how are you going to help us??? Wall street executives walk away with high pay outs on their investments or receive bonus checks for the work they have performed, most of them are snyde corporate executives who have helped put the economy where it is at today.... but what about the people who are doing the work for them?? ? We end up getting the struggle. We are the ones who will end up homeless and we are the ones who you talk about when you say AMERICA is struggling and we have not seen any relief except that you can continue to collect for another 13 weeks only to pay for it in the end... with the taxes you require us to pay back... WHY would you make those who are unemployed because of this melt down have to pay back? We did not ask for this in the first place. I wonder where we can find the money to give millions away in lotto but no money for the economy?? This is just something I do not get. I'm an upset American who is losing faith in you... I do not want to lose that faith.. When I voted for you, I really was inspired that you will make the changes to help us- the average middle class- but all I see is that upper class walking away feeling ok... while we continue to struggle. It's not fair... The honest middle class are sitting back struggling... it's just not fair... We never asked for this!! I don't expect anything from this letter... just put yourself in my shoes... Every day I'm watching my family fall apart and also worried about potentially losing my home... all because we of what we know... Yes, the economy is bad... yea yea yea... This is heartbreaking!!!\nSincerely,\n[Anonymous]\nWindsor Locks, CT\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Agriculture\n\"The proper role of government, however, is that of partner with the farmer -- never his master.

But better than that was the dill pickle jar that you could dive into, sometimes arm deep almost, and try to get one. I understand that they are not that accommodating anymore; we have got too efficient. When you go around picking things off the shelf, you pay for them. These, you understand, were free.

I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they [there] were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said he would get sick if he did so.

You could go to their burial pits and see horrors that really I wouldn't even want to begin to describe. I think people ought to know about such things.

This middle way means guarding against those enemies who would claim the privilege of freedom in order to destroy freedom itself.\"\nAddress at the Annual Convention of the National Young Republican Organization, Mount Rushmore National Monument, South Dakota, 6/11/1953.\n\"What I am saying here is we have had a group of the ablest and most loyal men I know in America, and people who realize this one great truth: in the operation of any great human organism, constructive plans and programs must be developed in what we call the great middle road. I always liken, in my own mind, the people marching forward into tomorrow as occupying a great road. Most of them instinctively grow to like the broad highway stretching before them and they understand here is where human progress is achieved. Those that insist on marching in the gutters in the extremes of the right and the left are, in the long run, always defeated. People instinctively think of themselves--and now I am excluding from this the moral field--you cannot, of course, use a lie, then a smaller lie and believe that such a process brings you to the truth. That doesn't work. I am talking about the practical affairs of getting humans in great numbers to work together. You must find the broad highway and you must ignore the gutters.\"\nRemarks at the Republican National Committee Breakfast, Chicago, Ill. 7/27/1960.\n\"People talk about the middle of the road as though it were unacceptable...The middle of the road is all of the usable surface. The extremes, right and left, are in the gutters.\"\nPress Conference, 11/17/1963\nPeace\n\"For we know this: no military victory, no diplomatic triumph, no precision-perfect foreign policy of our own can mean very much for very long--if it does not bring hope to hundreds of millions of people who live today in fear or need or hunger.

They will spend the day in unceasing toil. And as the sun goes down they will still know hunger. They will see suffering in the eyes of their children. Many despair that their labor will ever decently shelter their families or protect them against disease. So long as this is so, peace and freedom will be in danger throughout our world. For wherever free men lose hope of progress, liberty will be weakened and the seeds of conflict will be sown.\"\nRemarks of Welcome to the Delegates to the Tenth Colombo Plan Meeting, Seattle, Washington, 11/10/1958 [AUDIO]\n\"I like to believe that people, in the long run, are going to do more to promote peace than our governments.

There have been times in war where I thought nothing could be quite as wearing and tearing as that with lives directly involved. But I would say, on the whole, this is the most wearing, although not necessarily, as I say, the most tiring.\"\nThe President's News Conference at Key West, Florida, 1/8/56\n\"Many people are always saying the Presidency is too big a job for any one man. When I hear this assertion, I always try to point out that a single man must make the final decisions that affect the whole, but that proper organization brings to him only the questions and problems on which his decisions are needed. His own job is to be mentally prepared to make those decisions and then to be supported by an organization that will make sure they are carried out.\"\nLetter, DDE to Dillon Anderson, 1/22/68 [DDE's Post-Presidential Papers, 1968 Principal File, Box 36, \"An\"]\n\"On the other hand, I found that getting things done sometimes required other weapons from the Presidential arsenal -- persuasion, cajolery, even a little head-thumping here and there -- to say nothing of a personal streak of obstinacy which on occasion fires my boilers.\"\nSome Thoughts on the Presidency, Reader's Digest, November 1968\nReligion\n\"In other words, our form of government has no sense unless it is founded in a deeply felt religious faith, and I don't care what it is.\"\nAddress at the Freedoms Foundation, Waldorf-Astoria, New York City, New York, 12/22/52\n\"Today I think that prayer is just simply a necessity, because by prayer I believe we mean an effort to get in touch with the Infinite. We know that even our prayers are imperfect. Even our supplications are imperfect. Of course they are. We are imperfect human beings. But if we can back off from those problems and make the effort, then there is something that ties us all together. We have begun in our grasp of that basis of understanding, which is that all free government is firmly founded in a deeply-felt religious faith.\"\nRemarks at the Dedicatory Prayer Breakfast of the International Christian Leadership, 2/5/53\n\"The churches of America are citadels of our faith in individual freedom and human dignity. This faith is the living source of all our spiritual strength. And this strength is our matchless armor in our world-wide struggle against the forces of godless tyranny and oppression.\"\nMessage to the National Co-Chairmen, Commission of Religious Organizations, National Conference on Christians and Jews, 7/9/53\n\"From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural school house, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty. To anyone who truly loves America, nothing could be more inspiring than to contemplate this rededication of our youth, on each school morning, to our country's true meaning.\nEspecially is this meaningful as we regard today's world. Over the globe, mankind has been cruelly torn by violence and brutality and, by the millions, deadened in mind and soul by a materialistic philosophy of life. Man everywhere is appalled by the prospect of atomic war. In this somber setting, this law and its effects today have profound meaning. In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource, in peace or in war.\"\nStatement by the President Upon Signing Bill to Include the Words \"Under God\" in the Pledge to the Flag, 6/14/54\n\"Faith is the mightiest force that man has at his command. It impels human beings to greatness in thought and word and deed.\"\nAddress at the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches, Evanston, Illinois, 8/19/54 [AUDIO]\n\"We are essentially a religious people.

Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first -- the most basic -- expression of Americanism. Thus the Founding Fathers saw it, and thus, with God's help, it will continue to be.\"\nRemarks Recorded for the \"Back-to-God\" Program of the American Legion, 2/20/55\n\"Since the day of creation, the fondest hopes of men and women have been to pass on to their children something better than they themselves enjoyed. That hope represents a spark of the Divine which is implanted in every human breast.\"\nAddress at the Signing of the Declaration of Principles at the Meeting of the Presidents in Panama City, 7/22/56\n\"The purpose is Divine; the implementation is human. Our country and its government have made mistakes -- human mistakes. They have been of the head -- not of the heart. And it is still true that the great concept of the dignity of all men, alike created in the image of the Almighty, has been the compass by which we have tried and are trying to steer our course.\"\nAnnual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union, 1/10/57\n\"Basic to our democratic civilization are the principles and convictions that have bound us together as a nation. Among these are personal liberty, human rights, and the dignity of man. All these have their roots in a deeply held religious faith -- in a belief in God.\"\nAddress at U.S. Naval Academy Commencement, 6/4/58\n\"The freedom of a citizen and the freedom of a religious believer are more than intimately related; they are mutually dependent. These two liberties give life to the heart of our Nation.\"\nRemarks at the Cornerstone-Laying Ceremony for the Interchurch Center, New York City, New York, 10/12/58 [AUDIO]\nSports\n\"My constant prayer, these days, as I start my backswing is, 'Oh, please let me swing slowly.'

I cannot remember any day when we have had more fun on a stream. We had along with us three newspaper men and a few secret service people, many of whom had never seen a trout stream, so we did the thing up right by borrowing frying pans, bacon and corn meal from the wife of your rancher -- and we cooked an outdoor meal for the crowd. It was really quite a day.\"\nLetter, DDE to Bal F. Swan, 8/15/53 [DDE's Papers as President, Name Series, Box 7, \"Denver, 1953\"]\n\"One of the things that I noticed in war was how difficult it was for our soldiers, at first, to realize that there are no rules to war. Our men were raised in sports, where a referee runs a football game, or an umpire a baseball game, and so forth.\"\nRemarks at the Conference of the National Women's Advisory Committee on Civil Defense, 10/26/54 [AUDIO]\n\"And the other was this: the doctor did want to take off my leg because he thought it was necessary. But you must remember boys in those days were raised for two things: work, and then they made their play; and if you couldn't play baseball and box and play football, why, your life was ended. That was in our boyish minds.\"\nRadio and Television Broadcast: \"The Women Ask the President,\" 10/24/56\n\"But I think a life of raising prize cattle, going shooting two or three times a year, fishing in the summer, and interspersing the whole thing with some golf and bridge -- and whenever I felt like talking or writing, doing it with abandon and with no sense of responsibility whatsoever -- maybe such a life wouldn't be so bad.\"\nLetter, DDE to Alfred M.

I think it was in the fall of 1924 Lou Little was your coach, and he beat us. But it was a very happy circumstance, because it brought me the friendship of another man, Lou Little, who to this day remains my very warm associate and friend.\"\nRemarks at the Dedication of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University, 10/13/58 [AUDIO]\n\"Well, a funny thing, there are three that I like all for the same reason, golf, fishing, and shooting, and I do because first, they take you into the fields. There is mild exercise, the kind that an older individual probably should have. And on top of it, it induces you to take at any one time 2 or 3 hours, if you can, where you are thinking of the bird or that ball or the wily trout. Now, to my mind it is a very healthful, beneficial kind of thing, and I do it whenever I get a chance, as you well know.\"\nThe President's Press Conference of 10/15/58 [AUDIO]\n\"Morale -- the will to win, the fighting heart -- are the honored hallmarks of the football coach and player. Likewise, they are characteristic of the enterprising executive, the successful troop leader, the established artist and the dedicated teacher and scientist.\"\nRemarks at the First Football Hall of Fame Dinner, New York City, New York, 10/28/58 [AUDIO]\n\"I think of going back to the sports field again, and let's take a baseball game. Well, you have cracked out a grounder and you put in your last ounce of energy and you just happen to make first base. But you don't stop there. First base is the beginning. Now you call on all your alertness, your skill, your energy -- and you count on your teammates, you count on the people that are working with you. And the purpose of that getting on first base was to get you around to count a run.\"\nRemarks at a Republican Men's Luncheon in Cleveland, Ohio 11/4/60 [AUDIO]\n\"You did not tell me what you are doing athletically just now but I do hope that if your arm comes along next spring you can get it in good shape to try out for the pitching spot on the varsity.

But, in my opinion, there is no such thing as a preventive war. Although this suggestion is repeatedly made, none has yet explained how war prevents war.

This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway. We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road. the world has been taking.

He clarified that DOGE representatives at VA are reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans.\n“I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,” he said.\nCollins reinforced VA’s dedication to fulfilling its mission under President Trump’s leadership and concluded his message with an assurance of ongoing transparency regarding developments at VA.\nTopics in this story\nMore Stories\nBridge My Return (BMR) is a military-only platform designed to offer free career and job services to Veterans, military members and their spouses.\nThis post contains links to job listings for the week of Nov. 24, 2025.

I am concerned with the number of 100% disabled veterans I see and heard about in my circle of friends and family. I may be uninformed but appears there are a lot of grifters that are able to work a flawed system and get benefits that should only be going to those that are truly in need and deserving. I’d like to see a review of all those receiving disability to ferret out the abuse.\nSec Collins, while I really appreciate your videos, unfortunately, it is clear that your employees are not getting the message clearly or understanding what your promises mean, so they can change their attitudes to one of being customer-focused. It is clear that too many are little more than bureaucrats pushing papers rather than being proactive in addressing real issues.\nI have been a frequent poster here and on ask.va and I have received absolutely no help or support as promised in your video.\nHere is the latest questions, A-20250313-2151871, which contain SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS for those of us who live outside of the USA (under FMP)\nHere is another request for HELP A-20250227-2122402. I got a non-answer that told me nothing I didn’t already know but failed to answer a simple question.\nIn both cases, I got absolutely nothing of any value or help. All I got were canned responses to “call the VA,” which is not only time-consuming (the last time I spoke with the VA, I was on hold for 5 hours before I got a real person) but also expensive. As phone calls cost about $2/minute, the phone call cost me close to $600.\nThe problem is that what you are promising is really great, but your staff just don’t seem to understand that we expect them to help us solve the REAL PROBLEMS we are turning to them to solve.\nThe first IMPROVEMENT would be to stop expecting people from outside the USA to make phone calls. The VA needs to adopt Zoom or Microsoft “Teams” so we can talk with a REAL PERSON without incurring high expenses. You also need to direct your people to provide a NAME and their TITLE. Unless we have a name and a title then it is impossible to give compliments (as I did for one person from the OK office) or complaints.\nThank you in advance for providing a way for us to communicate DIRECTLY with your office, as many of these messages seem to “disappear.” Why can’t or won’t you identify an OMBUDSMAN team consisting of people who are committed to initiating ACTION to help solve REAL PROBLEMS?\nBR,\nDr. PDG, Jakarta\nDoug Collins is a liar. He is Trump’s VA puppet.\nThese politicians will say whatever they need to say to make it seem as if they care. They don’t care about me or you. I have been fighting for disability compensation since 2018 and my claims continue to get denied by someone sitting in a cubicle making decisions about whether or not my injuries were caused by my service to this country. The way the VA is set up is backwards. The VA shouldn’t be denying anyone their benefits that they earned. In fact, the VA should be the ones to prove that the injuries you sustained weren’t from the military, not the other way around. The way this country treats its veterans is shameful. Now we have a new Secretary of the Va but the same old BS. No transparency . I would love to talk to this Va Secretary but they have no interest in fixing this disaster. Just collect a paycheck that is paid for by you and me .\nDAC (Disabled American Veterans) has nothing to do with and does not receive any money from the government. DAV exists to help veterans, their widows/widowers and dependants deal with VA.\nI sent am email to the DAV a month ago asking them to help me with my claim.. I still haven’t received any response. It is good that the President is getting rid of the dead beats.\nDon’t expect anything from these incompetent fascist liars. trump actively hates veterans. Stop falling for his bullshit.\ns south korea 67-68 agent orange–7 years + if presumption of exposure is verified by VA\nif diseases are on the VA list that VA excepts THEN why would the VA deny benefits it may be the system GOOD LUCK\nfellow veterans please lets try to mind our words and stand by if we have nothing positive to contribute on this message forum- lets try to work together as i write this their are 2,238 comments on here and some are well intentioned, some are revealing our divide amongst our sides. I am on neither side I am with all of you as fellow Americans. This forum has been open since 05 November 2010, this thread has gotten the most comments ever and some are positive other’s are honest. I want to leave a food for thought moment, you are drowning in the ocean and the person who can save you is from across the aisle your political opposite. Is our divide animosity so strong that we may think it best to drown instead of receiving support from a fellow American.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nFuck that. Fuck trump and fuck anyone who supports him. They are a threat and should be treated as such. Your both sides nonsense accomplishes nothing.\nWe need to get rid of nonVetrans in Key administration positions of regional VA Offices\nYes! They are mostly contractors. They are in charge of approving our benefits.\nIt’s sad that there are so many misinformed or ignorant postings on this site against President Trump. The government is going to run out of money and no one is going to get any benefits if the US goes bankrupt and the currency is devalued and we lose the dollar as a reserve currency. Most government offices, need to be reformed, but accurately reformed.. the number of NGO’s ripping off the taxpayer is phenomenal.\nEat shit, moron. Trump supporters are traitors and fascists.\nI don’t trust them yet.\nDon’t trust trump loyalists ever.\nThis person was on a network espousing how they cut only those who need cutting. Acknowledging he states lawyer first in his bio, where does he get his healthcare? Have gotten nothing but excellent service at the VA as did my father. Thank you Veterans.\nMore talk—–Wants you to think ,he talks the talk, to make things happen—-I can not see the end of my claim and it’s on it’s 13th month —-no communication anywhere in this Circus, travel on your time and gas and then wait for ages to even get reimbursed ——this is a like real life scene from FBI last Monday——-that was the truth.- check the reruns on Paramont that is what 100’s of our Vets are going thru.\ngreat now find those files and pay them been ready since 2023 oct was to pay may 2024 o ou are the only one per admirals etc who is at that pay level to okd and pass to payables then after 286 pd they are the oldest wating then take pf the next bunch it is not hard sit down and get this done about 3 hrs of your time also cant communicate stil waiting for pass code so where is that email. next is there no funds to take care this tell the yrue factsor jd is over this dept need help i will drive there and read each file you neglecting for some reason retirement is noexcuse so sPitit out i am older than you. so man show some guts if this postion is beyond your norm then step aside\n.DO YOU HAVE REQUIRED MANAGEMENT AND GET THESE THINGS DONE SKILLS. PROVE YOURSELF\nI’m wondering what happened to Mike Nachinek over the department of Veterans affairs? I couldn’t even get a case number through my father’s illness John Paul Brewer retired US Navy. My cases are at oscn.net Mayes county in appeal . I sent complaints today online to HHS and I would like prosecution due to a letter from Donald J Trump President to stop false hospice.\nVery unliley that anything gets better, when so many people (incluyding a ton of VETS) are getting fired. Sounds like more fo that “Just Believe me” stuff. Would love an IG that is a retired VET put in place and the VA leadership actually woirks with him to cut waste but employ imprvement prgrams WITH Measurable metrics.\nOne of the problems I have experienced is when I ask for a referral for community care outside of the VA. Sometimes it takes several months. Case in point, it took me from September last until March 11 this year 2025. I found out it was sent to VA several times. It was found to be on head dentist in Tuskegee since Jan 18 of this year. Had to get another’s Doctor to override last week. This happens quite often with my primary doctor at the Podeshef Clinic in Columbus Ga.\nThank you\nBilly Cumbie\nDear Honorable secretary of Veterans affairs. Please contact the President to force prosecution around a Sept 17 2019 VA case filed in the Mayes county courts with inspector general HHS complaints made today. I will have to go back and submit Medicare and Medicaid information. Please study cases at http://www.oscn.net for international false profiling around healthcare that led to inveigling,elder abuse,medical restraints through false hospice under Sheriff Mike Reed Pryor Ok\nYou will not get a meaningful response from these incompetent fascists. They do not care about veterans.\nThese community care are kids fresh out of college. Community Care really SUCKS!!!!!!!\nDo,you really expect Vets to believe this pack of lies? Trump just cut 37,000 VA jibs!!!!\nWell, you’ll be happy to know that a federal judge just ruled that no employees at the VA will be terminated. Those who have must be reinstated immediately. VA secretary Collins has lost all credibility with the veterans and really should step down.\nOn behalf of veterans everywhere, go fuck yourself.\nThe harm against Veterans has been going on since 1979, not just ten years!!! Will a female disabled Veteran be harmed, treated badly, and attempted lethal harm if she goes to the VA now? West Virginia VA treated me very well and cared about my health. But in other VA hospitals, there was way too much violent, destructive, intentional harm!!! Acting above the law like we don’t matter only certain ones. Never corrected, or those attacking Veterans never held accountable!!! Can we female Veterans, whistleblower Veterans, and Veterans that people don’t like to get to go to the VA without being harmed in any way? I hope so without people toying with our lives!!! Than you for being there for us!!!\nDear Sec Collins, Here is an email I sent out earlier today CONGRATULATING one of your employees but offering CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISMS/SUGGESTIONS to improve the services being provided by the VA FMP office to those of us who live/work outside the USA.\nDear Ms. Grace, (and Mr/Ms No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311)),\nMore great news!!! I received notification yesterday that the VA had been SUCCESSFUL in transferring my first payment from the VA ELECTRONICALLY. So, thank you once again, Ms. Grace, for making this happen so promptly!!! I hope that Sec Collins’ office has commended you on your outstanding CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!\nHOWEVER, consistent with the promises that Sec Collins made on 5 Feb 2025: https://news.va.gov/press-room/secretary-collins-message-to-veterans-and-va-employees/ still leaves me with more questions.\nWe’re going to deliver timely access to care and benefits for every eligible Veteran, family member, caregiver and survivor.\nWe’re going to put Veterans at the center of everything VA does, focusing relentlessly on customer service and convenience.\nWe’re going to challenge the status quo in order to find new and better ways of helping VA beneficiaries.\nWe’re going to celebrate the vast majority of VA employees who do a great job every day and hold employees accountable when they fall short of the mission.\nWe’re going to provide Veterans with the health care choices they have earned while maintaining and improving VA’s direct health care capabilities.\nIn the context of these promises, and given I am still holding Mr/Ms No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311) accountable for all these SNAFUS, given the original amount the VA transferred was $8,278.18 but the actual money credited to our account was only $8,139.08, I want to know WHY was I PENALIZED $139.10 (1.68%) when you were told originally that my preference was to use a dollar-dominated account? Does this meet the letter or intent of what Sec Collins has promised us? Is this what any Vet deserves for his/her service?\nimage.png\nSo here are the questions I am raising with the expectations that the yet-to-be-identified Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311), will not only provide ANSWERS but will be PROACTIVE in making or facilitating the appropriate changes to bring the EXISTING policy and procedures in line to REFLECT the LETTER and INTENT of the COMMITMENTS Sec. Collins promised.\nQUESTIONS NEEDING ANSWERS AND CORRECTIVE/REMEDIAL ACTIONS from Mr/Ms. No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311) to meet the letter and intent of Sec. Collins promises:\n1) I originally provided a local USD dollar account with my local bank, but the VA informed me that they cannot/will not transfer to the dollar account, only to an Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) dominated account. Why should I, having provided my services to our country and now as a CUSTOMER of the VA, be expected to incur the risk of exchange rate fluctuations? Why have I been penalized $139.10 because the VA cannot/did not follow my original instructions?\n2) Why isn’t the VA ITEMIZING the payments? The VA paid $8,278.18, but how much of that was against the DISABILITY ($471.23 X 13 months = $5,482.49), and how much of that was REIMBURSEMENT of VA APPROVED payments for out-of-pocket medical expenses? ($29,775.06 through 23 Jan 2025) Without a detailed itemization showing what the VA FMP has paid and what you have not yet paid, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for either you or us to manage the cash flows.\nAs noted, this email with attachments is being submitted on Sec Collin’s message page. https://news.va.gov/138326/va-secretary-doug-collins-veterans-benefits/#comment-827171\nThank you again!!\nBR,\nDr. PDG, Jakarta\nDr. Paul D.

Don’t believe their lies.\nYou are a liar.\nQuit lying and eat shit, trumpie.\nFuck you and fuck doge and fuck trump you fuckers. You have alienated queer veterans and you are fucking liars. Rot in hell where you belong. I hope this administration crashes and burns and takes all you supporters with it. Fucking traitors all of you. Piss off.\nWhy are our comments and questions on here being deleted? That just proves that the basic intent of the current VA administration is to manage what we hear and say in this forum because the administration is about to screw us out of our disability and benefits, While they swear they aren’t going to eliminate them. 80,000 firings will surely devastate veterans care and services.\nNo mention of a national day of rallies IN SUPPORT OF VETERANS… in state capitols.\nMarch 15, noon, GO to your state capitol please.\nOk chief I’m a 60% DV served in the Air Force so you say there is no cuts at the VA. So all the Veterans that they laid off is made up that’s why no one believes in the government anymore its just hurry up and wait BS. if you served you know what that means. How can anyone work for a person that has dodged service and made fun of veterans all the time. This fool lost my respect when he talked shit about Sen. John McClain and now he has a Nazi doing something about waste ok, where is the money that he has saved its are money tax payer money not the governments. God save the USA from these idiots.\nWhy are our comments and questions on here being deleted?

It took me over an hour just to figure out how to sign in. Do you think a guy at my age could do this? Having to take numerous pictures of my driver’s license is just over the top. I had to take several pictures to get an approval. I am really upset with this nonsense. I am not a computer expert. What do you mean having to put in a website? Most people do not know their website.\nThat is what I would like to know. I haven’t been able to log in since December becuase of it.\nOk so it isn’t just me having this issue. Since late mid December I haven’t been able to log in. No matter what site I am sent to in order to correct the issue it fails.\nThank you for that information, my husband is 100% Vietnam vet,he also have PTSD,and agent orange disability.Glad to know he will be taking care of.We both are disable.I used to work for VA Hospital in the 1990’s and they were not good at all,a lot of messy people who was really mean, even before Trump was president,I had a hard time getting help from VA, and the hospital was awful, we had a hard time getting him approved for disibility.Still have a problem getting appointments and things he need,I hope things get better with Present Trump.\nI am so pleased that the Agent Orange claims. Will not end.\nI was exposed in the 1960s and now suffer from CLL leukemia.\nMy claim was opened in September of 2024. And I am in the process of submitting evidence of exposure.\nEdward N Peters\n[Editor: Do NOT publish your SSN or other personal information on the internet.

He is just another lying puppet MAGA MAGGOT!\nHe is a veteran\nDoesn’t matter; still a fascist traitor.\nBeing a veteran doesn’t automatically make you a good person. I’ve known many great people during my time in the service but also plenty of not so great people. I bet this new puppet is just as greedy and gluttonous as his master regardless of years of service. Stock up and get ready vets, I don’t see this ending without bloodshed on US soil.\nMy husband, Wayne A Pfuhl, was a US Army veteran and a retired police officer. His ashes were interred at the Ft Snelling National Cemetery in Minnesota on December 23, 2024. I placed a request for the Presidential Memorial Certificate for my husband to be signed by Donald J Trump. Can you advise if or when this request will be honored?\nGlad to hear this. but not convincing enough about Dodge. Dodge is BREAKING every law in its path, and he had not one word to say about that. He must be another Trump suck up.\nIf you are associated with Trump Administration, I don’t believe you.\nThat’s why you’ll always be a sheep.\nI hear Putin unzippig his fly. Line up to service him like a good tRumper. ?\nLick that boot, bow-n-scrap like a good tRumptard.\nSheep are the ones who don’t blindly follow something?\nAll this is confusing. I was trying to check my husband’s appointments on My Healthevet and got into this website. So many changes – they just changed the login procedures and now not sure what is happening. My husband uses Community Care for many appointments as getting appointments at the VA clinic was impossible or took months. Hopefully, the new Fredericksburg clinic will change that. It is very nice, but empty. As the speciality clinics are moved in I’m sure it will fill up. Most of the staff members are pleasant and do a good job. Mostly, the procedures for getting care could use some changes.\nWoundering why the VA clinic In Athens ohio will not put our president’s picture up .They had know problem putting Biden picture on the wall !!!\nI can’t stand looking at Trump, he is a criminal grifter.\nMR. Collins keep up the great work. I for one have had nothing but good experiences with the VA. There is a lot of hateful comments in this thread must be the Air Force. Keep up the good work, people need to relax and trust the process.\nwell, don’t expect those good experiences to continue as these cuts will result in fewer personnel to help with paperwork, doctors to find and treat illnesses, and facility maintenance personel.\nNext they will be requiring all disabled vets to be “re-assessed” under requirements that will push them out of care and into the streets. Trump doesn’t like losers that get captured or injured.\nfellas… fellas Much emotion discharged in all this commentary. BUT I FEEL YOU ALL! This battle for benefits is real for many a soldier who deserves what’s his… But for all the others who never proved themselves during their time of service, then shame on you for taking what’s not yours!\nAs for our new secretary, Doug Collins (and regardless of political orientation), we deserve to give this man the benefit of doubt but keep him in the “cross hairs” by measuring every word he says…. Verifying every promise he makes… Monitoring his deeds! And if he fails, let’s expose him then…. BUT if he performs and “does what he says he is going to do when he says he is going to do it”..then he deserves our praise and support.\nThat’s right fellas, lets grant this man the opportunity to prove himself battle ready.\nTime will ALWAYS either prove you or expose you!\nWhat the hell are you talking about. Does everyone who served have to receive a Purple Heart. I am USN and went to Nam and was washed over the side of my ship off the coast at 2 in the AM. We were pulling plane guard for the Midway. I served 3 tours, so bite ne. KMAMF.\nWhy would anyone trust him when he’s straight up lying to us?\nI am outraged that, as the purported leader of the VA, you are not doing everything you possibly can to disrupt and thwart this clear authoritarian plan to cut federal jobs, VA healthcare, and every other society-improving program that actually does good in this country. You should be ashamed of yourself, but it appears no one up there in the exec branch even has the ability to feel shame. So I am ashamed for you, and all those like you, who talk out of both sides of your mouth when trying to justify your actions. It’s reprehensible, and if you are not willing to lie down in front of the DOGE bulldozer for your constituency then you should just resign for principle and let someone more qualified and dedicated take the reins. Get out while you still have some semblance of a soul. Not that you ever did, by the looks of it.\ntrump hired him. Of course he’s a loyalist.\nI am completely shocked at the betrayal of this administration to its veterans. From mass firings across the federal government not based off performance of duties which affect numerous veterans to now cutting all their benefits and forcing the veterans around our nation who paid in blood t o have the bean counters turn their back on our veterans and have them suffer medically and possibly face homelessness is very disturbing and shameful. These actions will come full circle when all the veterans get a chance to vote this next go round and based off the above this administration is going to have to own this when the chips fall on them. So disgusting and shameful. May god have no mercy for these actions. I pray that we have no veterans die due to these actions.\nMr. Collins needs to crawl back into the hole he crawled out of. This is a privatization scheme. This is capitalism run amok. This is corruption in broad daylight. Someone’s going to have fat contracts and it won’t help the veteran. Traitors, all of you.\nDoug you are blue falcon , and a coward!! I bet you are receiving full benefits, while veterans are getting their taken away. Everyone sees through your lying Ass!\nWhy did you make a video to lie.? The cuts are posted on the Congressional Budget site. What is your problem? Can you read? I’m not sure you can because i am not sure you are qualified to hold the position.\nAs a service connected veteran I will be looking for a more streamlined VA system with better care. Staff that actually care about us the veterans.\nVa Secretary. Please stop acting incompetent. You have not been in office long enough to know what is or not good for the VA. Certainly letting Thousands go to any other means than Retirement is not being responsible or competent. Veterans signed a contract: Service Time and in return, life time treatment by VA. Not even you can or should try to do anything to derail such.\nYou took an oath of office. That Oath was not to a Man, King, Queen, Lunatic, or wannabe Dictator. The VA cannot afford to let anyone go without cause. Stop listening to Trump or anyone else.\nLiar.\nReduced service levels are just the first steps towards privatizing the VA.\nYou create a problem by cutting funding and service levels, and then say the solution is to privatize the system so the rich can get richer.\nComplete BS from this guy, he accepted slashing jobs in the VA. Then when people actually working at the VA say hey this is hurting us and hurting vets he goes on air and denies that lost jobs are causing issues. A total scumbag who will throw us all under the bus and rip away our benefits just to benefit himself and his masters.\nDoug Collins is the definition of a Bravo Foxtrot.\nRespectfully – This sounds like you’ve never called the public phone number for the VA. How is cutting your workforce going to make a vital and already understaffed department better able to help our Vets&their families? A huge percentage of VA workers are vets themselves, including disabled vets. Isn’t one of the goals to get Americans working? In past administrations when specific Fed jobs were deemed redundant the workers were retrained and given the opportunity for more efficient, needed jobs at equal if not higher pay. How is kicking these hard working Americans into the unemployment line pro-America? It seems like the ‘cuts ledger’ has only 1 side; these people (who’ve never served in the military, some of these kids are barely old enough to enlist) who are taking a slegehammer to the workforce seem to be (purposely?) neglectful of the future losses these cuts will cause. It can already take months for vets to be seen for therapy, medical care, job training etc. The faster our vets can get the benefits they need, to stay healthy and back to joining their families and communities, the better off for all of us. There are reports the VA Suicide Hotline is going to stop training because .. heaven forbid.. there are mentions of ‘LGBTQ’ in the training materials. While individuals are free to fear whoever they want the fact is LGBTQ people exist, there have always been LGBTQ Americans who have served our country. Shame on anyone trying to blame them for these ridiculous cuts -Turning your back not only on them, but on every other service member who is at the point of considering suicide is unconscionable. Please show what the US Military is supposed to stand for: protect our fellow Americans. Countries are not ‘businesses’ working to make profits for a handful of shareholders. The measure of ‘greatness’ isn’t a high profit margin. Stop selling out our veterans for a handful of businessmen who’ve never served and see those who did as ‘suckers’.\nI live in a rural area. We do not have local VA health care. This requires us to travel sometimes hours to get health care. I’m the last month travel pay has been turned over to a new agency that will not allow any contact from veterans and is denying my claims that have been verified valid requiring us to overload the appeal system to wait years to have valid claims paid while we suffer to obtain care so that someone in Washington can claim they are reducing fraud. There is no fraud here, when you can assign a contact number for vets to call in and review travel claim I will believe that you are not cutting. I have had 3 claims denied in the last month and need care. If you care, contact me… Then I will believe you aren’t blowing smoke.\nSure my stepdad been dead 3 yrs and still no grave marker.\nThen why Mr Secretary is the Legion having to push the Major Richard Star Act. Currently, combat-injured veterans face a reduction in their retirement pay for every dollar of disability compensation they receive. You lie. What’s next? Thank you for being another puppet in the Trump Musk Romper Room show. Resign sir.\nI find your videos to be absolutely arrogant and condescending. You do cheerleading for a POTUS who a 34x felon who DOES NOT respect vets. You say none of these haphazard cuts will affect healthcare but that is absolutely NOT TRUE and you know it. Stop lying! You KNOW the Veterans “Veterans Access Act” paves the way for pushing most and eventually ALL VA provided healthcare out into the Community so… Stop Lying (or hey, if you were unaware, see the assessment of this bill on Military.Com). You must be aware that there’s a GOP proposal to REDUCE VA disability payments by 30% once a disabled vet reaches 65.. right? Where are ya with that Mr. Doug? You’re also aware of the GOP proposal to reduce the healthcare services to those under 30% right Doug? Where are you with that? VA’s routinely SCORE HIGHER during Joint Commission audits than their civilian counterparts…. WHY Doug, would you want to dismantle a system proven to be better than outside hospitals? VA should be “the model” as their focus is on providing top-notch heath care rather than maximizing profit.\nAll those recent illegal firings now have the backing of a Federal Judge and have been ordered to be restored. Where were you for these employees? You just went along and broke the law… Then started spinning it. WHY? What is your motivation Doug? OPM’s now blaming the Agencies saying they never “ordered” you to do it… The OMB genius guy VOUGHT wants everyone traumatized. YOUR WORKFORCE is traumatized Doug… How do you expect a traumatized work-force to deliver top-notch care? How do you expect to attract and keep the best when YOU are literally terrorizing your staff and their families? Employees wont trust management for the next decade or longer and just how many of them are Vets that are being affected? You have to do better. If you cannot stand up to POTUS and his illegal actions, you aren’t fit to represent Veterans in OUR Affairs. If you are unable to tell the truth or do your job, please do the right thing and just resign. Right now you are absolutely tarnishing any legacy you might have had… The question is why? You ain’t no good ole boy, so stop with the bs ‘eh?\nWhere I am, my VA Doctor is the best doctor I’ve had. She is attentive, takes time to listen, and is very compassionate. She is leaving the VA because she is overwhelmed with the workload. The VA counselor I’ve been seeing for my PTSD is getting ready to leave because he is overbooked and sometimes double booked. I’m lucky if I get to meet with him once a month, (at my VA disability hearing I was instructed to see a therapist at least twice a month). There aren’t enough personnel to meet what is required. The pay is low, they get treated like robots, so they are leaving for the private sector. I have no idea how I’ll manage without my doctor and therapist. Getting hung out to dry after my service.\nI am not having fun or enjoying life as much today as the Veterans Association says their accounting records show I was overpaid by them a couple of years ago.\nI am told the Biden Administration and his Veteran System says I overpaid. The employee stated my old pension of $1413.00 a month would be $327.00 from now on. They reply,”there is nothing I can do about it as their accounting shows the proof. They never sent me any accounting or proof.\nThank god. I am 72 and get $1060.00 a month for social security. It was kind of a surprise for this old Vietnam veteran who is now having to live on $1387.00 a month.\nI just remember my old motto,”Things can only get better.” I am grateful though as I have God, family and you, my great friends in my life. I hate to post this but per the internet and on the Veterans sites it is an ongoing problem for over 50,000 veterans who are currently appealing this. Anyway, just wondering, can you help? Get the word out?\nThank you.\nJOHN BLANCHE/DBA ELVIS\nplease stop the cuts – you can’t cut your way to better health care. firing VA employees and reinvesting the savings doesn’t make sense. Government employees provide better service than contractors and in most cases at less cost.\nBlaming the press for news about significant cuts in VA personal is bogus. We veterans are not stupid. The fact that thousands of people are in fact being cut from the VA employee rolls (including veterans) is bound to have a detrimental effect on the delivery of benefits.\nAnd you did not address the question of whether Musk and his team of slash and burn expertise executioners will have, or do already have, access too our personal information. Instead you spoke about their reviewing contracts These actions are extremely worrisome to me and many others like me.\nIn this day and age, when “retribution” seems to be the operative word, I may be sticking my neck out by posting these comments, but as a conscious veteran I feel compelled to speak my piece, which I assume is still permitted in this great country!\nI retired from the Army in May of 1995. I didn’t apply for any disability rating until 17 years after I retired. My experience through out this entire time has been that the VA operates in a 3 word doctrine , Discourage, Delay and Deny. I watched as my neighbor who was a decorated Vietnam veteran of the 1st Cavalry Division kept applying for a disability rating for years due to combat wounds and Agent Orange exposure and after 5 years of trying he was awarded a whopping 0% disability rating. He passed away 2 years ago. I am rated at 70% currently but should be higher . My question for you sir is : Who sits on these revue boards and what qualifications due they have to make these decisions ? From some of claims that have been denied I think they are just unqualified people who can’t see the obviousness of why some claims are submitted. Please look into this ! I would also like to add that wait times for appointments at the Floyd Lindstrom VA clinic in Colorado Springs is way to long as it also is at the Rocky Mountain Regional Medical Center in Aurora Colorado. The excuse they both use is lack of staffing . When I ask for community care because the wait times are so long it takes another long period before you get an authorization. When there is an issue with getting a response from someone for anything and you contact a patient advocate, it takes sometimes 10 days to get a response from the. and just today I received an email from the the VA western Colorado health system that the Patient Advocate office hours are now limited again due to staffing issues. PLEASE FIX THIS !!\nWhy has the Indianapolis Radabush VA Hospital project to build a new Hospital been put on Hold??\nPlease assure us that The PACT Act will remain intact. We fear that laws passed by the previous administration will be targeted for DOGE scrutiny and removal. My husband is a “Bluewater Vet.” His Parkinson’s Disease and dementia are related to his Navy service in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam era, and we are grateful for the financial assistance provided by the PACT Act for his increasing need for care. Respectfully,\nThe out sourcing of disabilty claims is a nightmare for Veterans in many cases. Secretary Collins VA has our records. Many of us have records on file tha VA can provide by contacting a non VA intermediary. They often don’t have the Veterans records and the ask the veteran to to do the leg work in acquiring the records on their own. That can be beyond the capabilities of many us and a valid claim of a veteran may bo by the wayside and may be denied. Thiscan be simplified by VA keeping outside services who are I’ll equipped to provide proper service to the veteran. The want us to travel to their arranged places for tests. Many times they are many miles from our homes. When we have VA facilities in our local communities. I just had serious brain surgery and can not travel to locations for An EEG and another for an EKG and another for an XRAY and another for a psychiatric exam. This is out of control when all of these tests are in the VA records already. The aneurysm claim is linked to my service disability for high blood pressure. I need my claim to be expedited and granted 100% due to unemployability. I can not work with all of the issues that I have. This is not unique many of my fellow veterans are in this maze of VA red tape. I will assure you my local VA Clinic is outstanding but VA disability benefits go to outsourcing for further testing. Not necessary. This needs to get to VA Secretary Collins desk.\nI want the medical services at a VA Health care facility. Stop sending veterans to the private sector unless they specifically ask for that. Reducing staff means you’ll be trying to force veterans out of the VA health care system and into the private sector again. Stop denying it and stop doing it.\nThank you for saying this part. This has been my experience with the VA since 2020 and I hate it. When the VA was forced to use the private sector due to the CARE Act, I ended up being lost, forgotten and ignored by the private sector with the VA being unwilling to intervene. I’ve been without care for 5 years now. It took me years to get in to now have nothing and no faith in the system.\nGlad I left my VA job then too because I would’ve been fired for sure.\nThanks, Trump for fucking me and many other Vets over them and continuing to fuck us now, you Russian traitor. How the hell has any of what Trump has done has been good for us Vets?\nPlease partner with habitat for humanity to provide homes to vets. There are thousands of abandoned houses across the nation that they could refurbish and give to homeless vets\nI truly agree with this. It saddens me to see our boys in the streets… wondering about with a million thoughts in their minds…. No mission….no battle buddies….HOMELESS!\nI will personally work on this! Not via HUD and their red tape protocolos and policies, but via the private sector. I am designing $30,000 handicap-ready compact homes that can be built on a large track of land as cluster homes and be financed via our VA home loan benefits.\nIn essence, these will be Communities for vets only.\nMr. Collins\nAs Secretary of the VA, your job is to fight for Veterans Benefits rather than just accept the loss of 80,000 jobs. If you plan to just accept this loss you should resign.\nChet Hebble\nI will be asking the VFW,DAV , American Legion , Vietnam veterans of America, and all veterans groups to appeal to DOGE not to destroy the improvements that President Trump made in his first term in office. As someone who has personally dealt with downsizing of a organization I can understand the hard choices we need to make by contributing to the National Debt. I will be asking that Veterans Administration do a Four percent reduction in force for the first year 2025, Then five percent in 2026 . The total distruption of the Veterans Administration is not needed or necessary.\nYou are piece of crap Mr Collins. You and your drug addled south African asshole and go jump off a bridge. Its pretty clear that you, POTUS, and all republicans could care less about VETs.\nGO piss up a rope you fascist.\nDon your comments to Mr. Collins are totally uncalled for. I hope you don’t always have this attitude.\nHe has only been in the job three weeks. Your nasty post should of been deleted…………………………….\nGOLD STAR WIFE\nWhile your intentions sound good, why should anyone believe what you are telling us now? Trump and Musk are cutting things daily and the VA was already short. While the contention is that nothing will change for us Veterans, there have been too many lies, changes, etc., coming from the top, on a regular basis. Why should anyone trust you when you take your directions from these same unreliable people? With short staff already in place and open positions, cutting will only contribute to decreased care and less top notch providers.\nYOU ARE A FASCIST TRAITOR. I SEE A CHAPLAIN AND A VET. WHAT? A SINNER AS WELL.IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE ENOUGH EMPLOYEES.I HOPE TO GOD YOU ARE NOT A FAMILY MAN.YOU ARE A HUMILIATING EMBARRASSMENT TO THE COUNTRY GOOD LUCK GOING OUT IN PUBLIC YOU WILLBE MORE HUMILIATED. God is watching you\nAs the saying goes: You can fool all the people some of the time and You can fool some of the people all of the time but you can’t fool all of the people all the time. Unfortunately you may be fooling enough of the people in the short term. I’m waiting to see improvements to the system not its demise. In the short term you may find yourself to be the bureaucrat hearing “YOU ARE FIRED”, And it may not even be your fault. You may not have been able to find enough fraud and abuse or at least to say that you have. There will be no next comment. I am a registered independent voter. A veteran who has thus far been treated fairly and respectfully by the VA. What is going on now does not have the appearance of fairness. Why call for balancing the budget while at the same time asking for tax cuts? Show some common sense first make progress on the deficit and come back in two years to get paid for any progress made.\nSelf promoting political hackery. Not a word is sincere or believable. The current VA secretary has no intention of honoring commitments made to veterans. I recently had a visit to the ER at a VA medical center, and the nursing staff is freaking out. How does frightening and overworking medical staff improve veteran care?\nIt is sad and embarrassing to see the comments from the free loaders that did nothing to earn the benefits talking crap based on their mistaken political beliefs. Grow up and get a job instead of expecting handouts. They should cut the benefits for all that didn’t serve in combat or do a full 20. No more welfare for the lazy.\nGary, I served 20 years, and in 2 combat locations. I dont expect handouts. I am not a free loader. DID YOU????\nIt pisses me off that this Administration full of draft dodgers and notorious for disrespectful comments about veterans are now in charge, what a mess. YOU SIR NEED TO REEVALUATE YOUR COMMENTS OR MOVE BACK TO RUSSIA, YOU FIT RIGHT INTO THE TRUMP MINDSET> .\nGary, KMA and lick trumps boots.\nCombat does not happen with all of the support people also in boots—Medical corpsman here—was medical staff on the ground back home in hospitals that serve those who come back also important to you. Maybe that view from your high horse needs to adjust. We were ALL important in our jobs so that you could do yours.\nI have the upmost respect for Dog Collins. I listened to his video presentation and it left me with more questions than answers. As a service connected veteran, not 100%, I have been able to access the on base recreational facilities for camping with my family and guest for the last several years. We recently reserved camping sites as before and paid the necessary fees. A week or so later I received a call from veterans services on base that the regulations have changed and the benefits have been restricted to veterans with 100% disability and of course the normal active duty, retired, and reserve. The Service Connected veterans with less than 100% disabilities have lost some of their benefits. I would like clarification please. Thank you.\nHow much money does the VA spend on promo items like pen sets, coin purses drink coolers and MANY OTHER ITEMS FRIG MANEGNETS A TPON OF CRAP?\nHey, Comrade Collinski…I hate it when someone pisses on my leg and tells me it’s raining out. And I hate it more when it’s a Trump ass-kisser doing it. Do everyone a favor and keep your lies to yourself.\nSecretary Collins:\nCutting 82,000 jobs will indeed cut our benefits. This proposed cut is not a media fantasy, it exists in an official memo–and you know that.\nI am a Purple Heart Combat Veteran, and I want you to know that the VA provides excellent health care with its very limited resources. The VA has been running on a reduced budget already, so it cannot absorb a slashing of 82,000 personnel and still provide benefits we now have. Wait times will further degrade. My local facility has already eliminated paid reception and desk jobs and replaced them with unpaid volunteers. There is no slack.\nPlease honor your pledge to ensure our VA will continue to provide good health care. Go to bat for us.\nVa has been trying to get the iu and they are trying take away after 67 will the 200.000 over 67 will get the shaft and loose loss what states provide. Like home tax, free fishing licenses and much more Texas will give no home tax relief for my wife if i die. I am 82 years old and it want long before I will die .\nYou piece of garbage! You, trump, musk and vance are ALL GARBAGE!!!!\nMaybe you should have done something and served in the real military rather than talk crap.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General. Those folks know what they seek, honed by years of collective experience in the organization. They, not some group of uncleared people unfamiliar with the working and, often, legally required processes of the VA, are the BEST to continue their diligence in finding better ways to carry on the VA mission. They are your most valuable resources for improving the VA and investigating and uncovering fraud and corrupt practices. Further, your statement “…find things we need to get rid of…” speaks volumes about someone with very little experience in the processes involved. The key to gaining efficiency and effectiveness is not to “get rid of” but to find ways to IMPROVE the quality and the processes that help achieve the mission. As long as your “partners” try to trash the system they don’t understand, there can never be acceptable change for the better.\nAt first, 1400 probationary VA employees were fired. And, now, you recently announced another 80,000 to be fired. How do you expect the VA to better assist Veterans, especially in areas like getting appointments more rapidly if you are firing the people who answered the phones? You must realize that the people you call partners, including the president, do not have the best interests of Veterans in mind – he has already called us “suckers” and “losers.” And, from everything I have you say, you don’t care about veterans either. You better get this straight: we are neither. We have defended our nation against threats like this before and will again. We are Veterans, and we Vote. We had a term for “shipmates” like you, Bravo Foxtrot. So far, you have earned it.\nGer Elon Musk OUT OF THE VA. He doesnt care about VETERANS. NO PRIVATIZATION\nOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just noticed your disclaimer that whatever a Veteran post, the post is going to be changed to more moderate wording. To that I say what I post is my 1st amendment right, so hand off the wording…………………..\nDam!!!, I cannot believe you took the time to make another video with NO Factual basis (all lies). I am 80 years old, Disabled Vietnam Veteran, and your good old boy down home speaking is as phony as the word coming out of your mouth. The V.A. clinic where I go for healthcare has a hard time servicing all of the Veteran who need help due to MUSK and Trump cuts. The more you cut employees the Longer and longer it is going to be to schedule an appointment for care. Not enough Doctors, nurses or medical folks with the right expertise to care for Veteran’s needs. I believe MUSK and TRUMP would rather have all of the Veteran who served this Great Country Die off rather than help them with their healthcare. I guess you don’t remember what NON-MILITARY (draft dodger) said about the Navy Hero Senator McCain. Trump doesn’t RESPECT him because he got CAPITURED, Tortured, something he or Musk will never experience…………..\nI just want to know, why is it that the first thing every party, democrats and republicans always wants to cut veterans benefits and social security??? I would think the kickbacks being taken away from the politicians would pretty much take care of the deficit, wouldn’t you agree??\nPlease secure jobs for the healthcare providers at the VA. These GREAT folks are overwhelmed with veterans requiring their services. It would benefit our veterans if you could increase the number of healthcare workers and decrease the number of bureaucrats (most of whom are quite useless). In fact the folks at the Wisconisin Evidence Intake Center have NO idea what they are doing when it comes to Vietnam Navy Veterans. These people cannot even determine longitude and latitude on a map when determining where a ship was stationed according to the ship’s deck logs. This puts our Navy Vets at a disadvantage when applying for benefits. Please Mr. Secretary sort out this bureaucratic MESS!!! Thank You\nYou overwhelmingly voted for a reduction in EVERYTHING, so stop whining. Trump was correct when he said veterans are a bunch of suckers.\nCollins, you are lying. Stop lying to veterans!! We have been betrayed. Lincoln made promises when he created the Veterans administration to care for those that shouldered the burden of this country’s wars. Trump, DOGE and Elon Musk are bragging about cuts. Trump has never respected us. He calls us suckers. He says he has no respect for POW’s because they are losers for getting captured. He doesn’t want the most injured of us all to be brought out at public events. We remember. I will never forget this country’s betrayal. I used to take great pride in serving my country. No longer.\nI have been dealing with the VA sense I retired in 1998. The past month VA help has been better than the past 20 years. I got a referral that I needed for back issues I have had for worn out hip joints from running 5 miles a day while in the military.\nI see many posts on this site condemning the new administration. Most are unhinged. With nothing more than Ad Hominem attacks on a man they never met. Whom they hate, with a hate a demon would be proud of. Not even willing to hear the truth, but are influenced by a political party that would leave them to die on the battle field just like in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, or Abby Gate in 2021.\nThank you Mr Collins for taking control of a broken health care system for us veterans that in the past would allow us to die in pain rather than give us the treatments we earned for our service. May God be your guide and give you his wisdom and strength to write the ship that was left to list in the mothball grave yard.\nVeteran care is being impacted already.\nAlong with many of the previous comments I don’t believe anything you say. You are allowing a draft dodger who knows nothing about military service and is known to badger and insult military people make decisions on something as important as our veterans, he is getting rid of the pact act for revenge my husband gave up so much and is now a 100% disabled. I can not express how disgusted I am with this administration\nDOGE wants to fire as many as 80,000 VA workers. How does this not impact Veterans who receive care at facilities around the country that are being threatened with closure and the loss of workers? Providing easy to access care to our Veterans is part of their benefits we the people (via our government including our Presidents) promised to them, is it not?\nAll we ask for is the earned return for our signature that’s it nothing more nothing less.\nHe’s a liar. It’s been a right wing project for decades to defund VA until it barely functions. Then they complain about how it’s too big a bureaucracy and it’s failing vets. This is all in an effort to give the medical contacts to their wealthy friends. The VA is the only public healthcare in this country, and it is much beloved, so they have to destroy it. Hands off VA!\nYOU’RE JUST SPOUTING THE PARTY LINE! TIME WILL TELL THE REAL TRUTH.\nMr. Secretary,\nThe biggest issue I see with the current mandate to cut jobs is that it focuses solely on reducing headcount rather than improving efficiency or service quality. If the goal were truly to streamline operations, the mandate should focus on identifying inefficiencies within the department—many of which appear to be intentional. The VA routinely slows the processing of claims and services, seemingly as a cost-saving measure. By creating delays, veterans are forced to wait for care, which in turn reduces the VA’s immediate financial obligations.\nA personal example: My therapist switched practices, and I requested that my authorization be transferred to the new location. Despite providing all necessary information immediately, Community Care first authorized the original practice instead. When I pointed out the mistake, they canceled my authorization entirely. Then, only after I followed up multiple times, I was told there was a two-month backlog for new authorizations. A simple administrative change took four months to resolve, during which my mental health deteriorated. I can only imagine what happens to veterans with more severe conditions who lack the ability to advocate for themselves.\nTo make matters worse, I was informed that this authorization was intended to close my need for therapy. That decision should not be made by bureaucrats—it should be between me and my therapist. Given the lasting impact of my military service, I will likely need mental health support for the rest of my life.\nIf the VA is serious about reducing waste, it should start by identifying policies and procedures that seem intentionally designed to create bureaucratic delays in services. These inefficiencies do not just inconvenience veterans—they actively harm those in need of care. Additionally, the VA should conduct audits to identify deceased veterans whose benefits are still being paid, preventing unnecessary financial loss without restricting care for the living.\nThe current approach to cost-cutting prioritizes hitting a number over people. It’s time to focus on real reform.\nAdditionally, another approach to improving efficiency and accountability in military and veteran affairs would be to consolidate the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) budget into the Department of Defense (DoD) budget. Instead of the VA receiving a separate allocation, a designated percentage of the DoD’s total budget could be earmarked for veteran care.\nCurrently, VA funding is a little over 41% of the DoD’s budget. Setting a benchmark of 40% as a starting point would save approximately $5 billion, while still maintaining strong veteran support. This shift would place greater responsibility on the DoD to prioritize the long-term health and well-being of service members, ensuring that decisions made during active duty do not create unnecessary burdens on the VA system later.\nAdditionally, this reform would introduce accountability mechanisms within the DoD. Right now, the DoD operates with virtually no financial checks and balances, as any effort to reduce or restructure its budget is often framed as being anti-military. By tying VA funding directly to the DoD’s budget, poor decision-making or inefficiencies within the military would have real financial consequences, forcing leadership to be more strategic about both spending and personnel policies.\nOf course, there would also need to be a separate accountability mechanism for the VA to ensure that the reallocation of funds results in better, not worse, services for veterans.\nI previously submitted similar ideas to the White House for consideration by the Department of Governmental Operations and Efficiency (DOGE), along with an offer to volunteer my expertise as a BA and MBA-educated veteran honor student. Unfortunately, I received no response. You have my name Mr. Secretary, I’m the only one I know of, feel free to have someone contact me.\nWould be even better if you didn’t reduce the benefits for a 100% disabled veteran because YOU made a mistake and paid me $1600 too much educational benefits when we’re sending money to every country, known and unknown, to pay for:\n* $1.5 million to “advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces and business communities”\n* $70,000 for production of a “DEI musical” in Ireland\n* $2.5 million for electric vehicles for Vietnam\n* $47,000 for a “transgender opera” in Colombia\n* $32,000 for a “transgender comic book” in Peru\n* $2 million for sex changes and “LGBT activism” in Guatemala\n* $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt\n* Hundreds of thousands of dollars for a non-profit linked to designated terrorist organizations — even AFTER an inspector general launched an investigation\n* Millions to EcoHealth Alliance — which was involved in research at the Wuhan lab\n* “Hundreds of thousands of meals that went to al Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria”\n* Funding to print “personalized” contraceptives birth control devices in developing countries\n* Hundreds of millions of dollars to fund “irrigation canals, farming equipment, and even fertilizer used to support the unprecedented poppy cultivation and heroin production in Afghanistan,” benefiting the Taliban\nBut good on you taking back $100 from me every month\nI appreciate what you said in your video. I have 3 claims that have been in limbo for months. Just trying to get the disability rating I deserve is a task I shouldn’t have to fight. I served in Desert Storm and Somalia (PACT ACT) and keep getting denied. Please fix that. It’s been months on these claims and they haven’t moved. DOGE needs to get involved with that aspect. People like Marc in his rude statement, should not be listened to. I’m a proud Veteran and I appreciate you. Thank you, sir.\nDeleting veterans comments because you dislike the words is not going to change the outcome for those that steal our benefits. Don’t forget who trained us and what we were trained for a$$clowns.\nYou were an election denier who signed his name to a brief seeking to overturn a free and fair election. No facts in that brief just made up hog wash.\nNow you are head of the VA appointed by Trump. You got your payback for supporting him.\nYou should be ashamed of supporting that lie on the record.\nFiring VA staff for no reason will only hurt veterans.\nEvery time I go to the VA I now have to avoid looking at your picture as well as Trumps.\nThere is no reason to be nasty to Mr.Collins.He has only been in the job a couple of weeks. Totally disrespectful.\nGold Star Wife\nGet off your knees and grow a spine. It’s unbelievable how a coward like you can actually run Veteran’s Affairs.\nMr Collins thank you for your post and video. I am a Air Force veteran from the 60’s and over all the VA has been good to me. However I hope you will look at the VA billing system which in my opinion is in great need to be upgraded, I am on a copay for some things and the way the VA handles this is a total mess. Just have someone check my account and it should be oblivious. I am treated out of the Columbia MO VA.I would be more thank happy to talk to someone about this. Thanks John\nYou miserable asshat! All you are is a “Tool” for an “Orange Painted” fool of a fascist. Your plans will harm those who you say, that you are there to serve. Grow a Spine!\nWow! A *lot* of comments here! Just wanted to say that I’ve been dealing with VA since ’76 and realistically in the past 6 years or so has it been consistently great for me. But now I can imagine which services are going to be axed, delayed and impaired with cuts… And basically cuts just for the sake of cuts (with a sword not scalpel), without actually looking at and identifying areas that could be cut, or further improved for matter. I hate to say it but it feels like, “hey let’s do what Elon’s doing because, hey, he’s the richest man in the world” even though helping veterans who served their country is far cry from buying satellite and rocket companies.\nSadly, I have noticed a slow down with processing claims Since the election, I am a supporter of President Trump but I think there’s been a mistake at the VA and it’s gonna cost all of us pain. We cannot even ask for a projected date for the resolution of one’s claim. Normally it would take about 45 days to approve or disapprove a claim now I am at 60 days in step number two and Fear that there will be no definite time resolution it could go on for months or years. I’m losing confidence in the system. This is very scary at 71 years old now I don’t have a lot of time. And from reading the comments below from my brothers, it appears that I’m not alone, the secretary remember is a politician first. So it appears that these cuts at the VA are in fact impacting veterans in a negative way. That’s why I came to read these comments one can only come to the conclusion that we as veterans are going to be hurt. How sad.\nThis administration gives a ratsass about veterans. Hell, the Dictator in Chief called us losers.\nWe will pay the bill for our votes.\nReally Johnny? So that’s why POTUS DJT started the Veteran Crises Hot Line in his first 4 years? Giving us Veterans a hotline to call if we need help. Maybe you should stop watching the paid for media outlets like CNN and MSNBC.\nYou actually believe that Trump created the VA helpline? The suicide prevention line? He did not. I worked in the field. Trump created nothing but problems for the active duty and now veterans. Those lines are not the work of Trump. Anything having to do with mental health related lines were already in practice. He takes credit for others’ work.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs established the Veterans Crisis Line in 2007 as a 24/7 resource to provide confidential help to veterans and their loved ones in need of support.\nIn 2022, the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline transitioned from the standard 10-digit phone number to the more recognizable 3-digit number, 988.\nTo reach the Veterans Crisis Line, callers can now dial 988 and press 1. The line is accessible through call, text, or chat.\nThe intent of this shift was to make the phone number for the Lifeline easier to remember and more accessible for people who need immediate crisis support.\nJerry the veterans crisishotline has been going since 2007 you couldn’t be more wrong\nSo, what did you think he was going to do while you watched him lie to the American people? Then you voted for him. You are a fool for believe his lies!!! The Bible warns of increasing lies and deception in the “last days,” with passages like 2 Timothy 3:1-9 describing a time of moral decay and a strong delusion where people will reject truth and embrace falsehoods.\nIn 2000, DOD and VA conspired to drive off grass roots groups. We used\nto be invited to Pentagon briefs. But, with the creation of Deployment\nHealth – only members of the military family alliance that were chartered\nby Congress were allowed to attend any more. Service groups were fine\nwith this. Less disruptions. Less to compete with. DOD cuts us off.\nBy 2002, DOD slowly started to also cut off the service groups from certain\nevents as well. Limiting access to information. By 2003, all were distracted\nwith OIF OEF.\n2004, Deployment Health did all it could to pad, and hide any medical problems\nsurfacing from Afghanistan, Iraq. West Nile Virus, Acinetobacter Baumannii,\nVisceral and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, and IED as well as EOD injury issues.\nBy 2005, VA no longer allowed grass roots upstairs to meet with staff. Only\nservice groups. Service groups were fine with this. IOM / NIH began cutting off\ngrassroots and service groups from its workshops.\nBy 2010, VA started driving away the service groups. Not briefing them on\ncertain things. As did DOD. Sec of VA Eric Shinseki had grudge matches with\nanyone publishing news or materials he didnt approve. Then he resigned\nin disgrace.\nBy 2012 VA and DOD actively started removing advocates from committees\nand functions. Started rigging VA committees with internal ringers that would\nnot publish, seeking out congress, or rock the boat. Media started writing less\nand less veteran stories.\n2016 would be the last serious batch of veteran related congressional hearings.\nCongress no longer wanted the service groups and limited them to there\nbudget proposals in the spring. After this, it was mostly OEF and OIF till the\nPACT act became necessary.\n2021 came along, Covid let VA and DOD keep every one at bay. Limit meetings\nto video conference. Stopped answering phones. Now media is on board and\nno longer writing veterans stories. Cutting VSOs out as well. Google started\nblocking any websites that said anything harsh about VA and DOD.\n2024, VA started removing public comments from its meetings and ignored\nany still up. VA stopped writing anyone outside of VA that wasnt part of\nthe inner circle. Openly opposing the service groups. No one was welcome\nupstairs and the dont have to answer phones, email.\n2025, Trump and Elon step in to take advantage of this vacuum to gut most\nagencies, and with VA disregard for veterans – there is no loyalty. So no job\nis secure and everyone is threatened. Your public comments here are largely\nangry veterans spewing at you with no loyalty. You may have a few ringers\non the inside still supporting you, yes men, its not enough to stop the wave\nof cuts coming. because there is no unification across the boards.\nThis all started with DODs need to hide in plain sight, and lump all wars into\nthe Deployment Health catch all. Make everything generic. Seems like now is\nthe time to team up with all sides, eras, and the service groups like it was\nbefore DOD undermined all this. Strength in numbers. Now is a good time\nto post a public voting format within VA of what its veterans want. Instead\nof telling them what they want.\nKeep the current path, it all ends in chaos. Stop insulting people, keep things\nsimple – and just provide the service you supposed to minus the games. At\nleast with this purge at VA, you will unite people alright – an angry mob that\nyou betrayed protesting in unison in front of your doors. The elitist days of\nsnobs looking down on the public is about to unravel. More of the same\nand worse failed. Each angry vet created is for a lifetime, and dont think they\njust plan to keep taking this. Millions betrayed, Im so thrilled Im not you.\nThank you for breakdown.\nSecretary Collin’s, I hate to see anyone lose their jobs but the answer to the problem isn’t quantity of people, it’s quality of people. My amazing VA primary care doctor retired and was replaced by a provider who personally insulted me the first time she saw me and has treated me like garbage. Now shdoes not want me for a patient and I don’t go to the doctor even when it is needed. I suffer daily! we have a beautiful new facility here in Columbus GA but I’m not sure what the purpose of building it was. It appears to be a big empty building.\nI am grateful for t he OUTSIDE care I get from the VA. Seeing outside providers is the only way I get quality care except for mental health care I receive. Why can’t I see someone outside the VA for primary care?\nIf you are going to reduce the VA work force by 83,000 employees. That means that 82,000 veterans will loose their jobs.\nAs a veteran, how is that supposed to be OK with me?\nAbsolutely Trump propaganda!! DOGE, project 2025 & Trump’s entire agenda is anti American, anti democracy, pro Russia & meant to advance the mega rich. Cutting the VA workforce by %20 (70,000) is not advancing the mission, it’s sabotaging the delivery of services to veterans. Musk/DOGE could start by eliminating the waste & abuse in Musk’s numerous billion dollar government contracts. You are part of Trump’s “revenge/retribution administration. We are not fools. Those who speak out I’m sure will be targeted by Trump’s administration.\ni have being trying to fight the VA for over 18 years and the only goal for the VA is to see us die and never get our entitlements. Sadly the VA is not here to help us Veterans but to impede us from getting help, aid and ensure that many of us never get our entitlements. I have seen many brothers and sisters die because the doings of the criminal organization known as the VA. I have being trying to disability retire from my current job but all can only be attainable if i ever get my 100% total and perm but even as my law firm fights for me, I still do not see the light because the criminal organization known as the VA will do anything to ensure we vets never get our entitlements and just die to completely push us away.\nMyself and many of my brothers at arms have been fighting the VA for years due to the VA denying everything illegally, unlawfully and simply in spite. I personally have being fighting the VA over 18 years and they illegaly remove % for our records to lower our profiles. after many years and many law firms i was able to get a 90% because they denied many ailments that where proved to began while in service but they have continue to deny myself and many of our brothers and sisters our rights. I was even downgraded illegaly to 80% without no appt, no proof or anything.\nWhen I left the military in 2007 I have no idea what i needed to do with the VA because nobody ever helped me or guided me to what my entitlements were, i had no idea. So since then i have been fighting this uphill battle. I have helped dozens of vets so they do not have to go through what i have been going thru for almost 20 battle. and thankfully most have been able to get their entitlements assigned properly due to getting out prepared and with good guidance.\nI am pursuing disability retirement from my current job due to my ailments but finally receiving my 100% total and permanent that I deserve is imperative and hopefully my current law firm will be able to finally.\nThe VA is supposed to be here to help us Veterans but they are only here to hurt us and worse.\nYou are a LIAR!!\nHell yeah he is. He must think we’re stupid.\nI’m a disable Vietnam vet and have been dealing with the VA since the early 70s.\nAll I can say about Secretary Collins’ “kicking the can” message is that it’s just more self serving BS from the Draft Dodger in Chief and his MAGA minions.\nThe VA has always been chronically understaffed, underfunded, and overwhelmed by requests for care so how is removing 1000s of employees, many of them veterans, along with programs and funding going to help anything or anybody, let along improve things?\nThe plain truth is that it’s not and if Sec. Collins goes along with this farce it just proves that he’s more interested in keeping his place at the tax payer funded feed trough than he is in helping veterans.\nAll you boot lickers are disgusting.\nStop by Doug Collins office, make him tell you to your face that he supports cutting 80k VA jobs.\n810 Vermont Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 2042\n#VeteransRally\nI’m decorated, injured and former member of socom with full benefits, and have NEVER had an issue with my benefits or staff. Yes, there’s been a few messups but always resolved. We as veterans earned benefits and should greatly appreciate what we get. The members of other agencies who also put in work have often gotten none. Can it be inproved? Always !!!! It hasn’t even been 2 months. Breathe in people.\nWhile I am not in the same league at 60%, I also have had the best care at the VA for my SC injuries. However, I do not want to wait while my fellow veterans are harmed by the actions by this political appointee Collins. He does not appear to speak truth.\nCentral to these efforts is a pragmatic and disciplined approach to eliminating waste and bureaucracy, increasing efficiency and improving health care benefits and services to veterans,” said Collins. Collins is in support of cutting VA health care workers. He is a fake Jesus loving liar. He will need increased security\nArmy veteran.\nI listened to your comments on “making the VA more efficient”.\n70k job losses….are NOT the way you make the VA more efficient.\nMy suggestion? Check yourself into a VA mental ward.\nOoooh my mistake…the wait will increase from 6 months to 2 years to see a doctor with your cuts in VA.\nJust lunacy.\nWhy is the va allowed to use there own math when dealing with veterans disabilities I happen to be 100 percent disabled but va math makes it 70 percent to me this is a huge slap in the face of veterans who put there lives on the line then find out the very agency that is supposed to be helping veterans comes up with this formula I am not naive they use this tool to save money off the backs of those who have sacrificed themselves I would love to new secretary to address this issue.\nThanks\nSo please explain to me why I’m still a homeless veteran trying to deal with SSVF or VASH and human beings that should not be working in Customer Service or social work in Sacramento CA.\nJust saw this liar on PBS. “Veterans benefits aren’t being cut”.\nWhere does Trump find these dumb hicks to run his government?\nWho is this joker…?\nDOGE needs to focus on the top and work its way down. Why don’t they first look at how much The White House spends daily? Or why in 2000 we had a surplus and now in the trillions in debt. Hmm could it have been that we were in two conflicts for almost two decades. It was ridiculous the amount of money spent there. Why don’t they look at how much we spent on defense contracts all those years. Or maybe we increased our force during those times for the surges. Why haven’t we drawn down the force? It was done after Vietnam and first Gulf War. DOGE is focusing on making the rich richer and the poor poorer. I defended my country for 21 years active duty with multiple deployments. Is this what our country has become, full of lies from the top down? If each person in our Nation could do one kind act WE the people would become a Great Nation Again.\nHey 1sg, Newsflash, in 2000 the United states didn’t have a surplus. Check your facts before you spew bullshit.\nHow about you get the fact Cpt. Clueless.\nn 2000, the United States federal government had a budget surplus of $236.9 billion, the largest in U.S. history at the time. This was the third consecutive year of a surplus.\nDetails\nThe total revenue for 2000 was $2,025 billion, an increase of $197.7 billion from 1999\nThe total outlays for 2000 were $1,788.1 billion, an increase of $85.2 billion from 1999\nThe surplus was 2.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP)\nThe surplus was the largest as a share of the economy since 1948\nOther budget highlights\nThe surplus was the result of the Clinton administration’s economic policies\nThe surplus was the result of a $363 billion reduction in the publicly held debt between 1998 and 2000\nThe surplus was the result of eight consecutive years of fiscal improvement\nAdditional information\nThe federal budget for 2000 was a spending request submitted by President Bill Clinton to fund government operations for the period from October 1999 to September 2000.\nDear Secretary Collins,\nIn your recent X post, you said the word duplicative. Please consider this: When a veteran is considered for benefits, the VA will send the member to a VA-sanctioned vendor to confirm the disability. Why do this when the member was already tasked to have a certified MD acknowledge the condition via a Nexus letter. Are the physician’s credentials, words, and signature stamps not worthy of acknowledgment of the condition?\nAnother cost-saving measure might be to allow retired members who utilize TRICARE Primary Managers (already sanctioned to care for veterans), as the determining authority. Adding a VA vendor to this process is duplicative since TRICARE Primary Managers are already vetted to care for retirees.\nTheir is a memo CNN obtained from your office requiring the firing of 70,000 DVA employees. That’s 20% of the DVA workforce. You stated, “concerns that Veterans’ benefits might be targeted for cuts”, “I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut”, “In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.” The memo is published and factual. How is removing the workforce by 20% improve healthcare services, compensations and pensions, the PACT ACT, DVA medical housing, suicide prevention, and other disabled veteran services. It takes 9 months to get an appointment with a neurologist in Tucson DVA. Veterans have died waiting for DVA appointments. Senator McCain took actions to improve the Tucson DVA by adding the doctors you want to fire. YOU LIE and must have no care for veteran services, just veteran service reductions. Prove me wrong with facts, not lies. I had lots of respect for Republicans, but not for the person, proven a liar by a court jury, guilty of 34 incidents of fraud appointing you as Secretary of DVA. I have no respect for the Republicans siding with fear of this fraudster. You too sides with the Fraudster with praise due to fear to stand up to the fraudster.\nNine months is too long to wait in order to be seen by a VA neurologist. I also would like to better understand how removing 70,000 to 80, 000 VA employees will lead to better care for veterans.\nI stopped believing you at CNN.\nI personally visited the Fredericksburg 3 VA Clinic in Fredericksburg, Virginia on 3 March 2025. It is a beautiful facility that was not adequately staffed. I was told that the lab would only be open until 2 pm and that none of the specialty providers were available at that location due to funding. Secretary Collins, I implore you to have the honor and morals to do the right thing for your fellow veterans. We are hearing you tell us that VA services are not being affected as we watch it happen in real time. You have a moral imperative to do the right thing for the women and men who have honorably served this country. I expect more of you than this.\nMy husband has enjoyed VA benefits for many years and I am glad to read in this article that benefits are not going to be cut. I believe this info needs to be published on every news channel over and over. The American veterans need to know for sure that their benefits are not going to be cut in this attempt to make our country more accountable in the spending that is done.\nPlease tell the people . The left media seems to be spreading false information about Care for our veterans.\nhttps://newrepublic.com/post/192252/trump-lawyer-alina-habba-fired-veterans-arent-fit-job\nmy son was wounded in Iraq 2006,with TBI then MS. in a wheelchair, and went to Sneedville,Tenn. with a woman he married.

I was told died from MS> but I have alot of info. and statement from EMT. ,my son was left to starve to death. and I also found out more info. about other wounded . and us mothers call them “military maggots” who marry disabled vets for the funds. and I have dates ,times, and people who allowed my son to die this terrible way.

Dennis Keoki Cabanting served proudly ,only to die alone and neglected by so many\nAP article today 3/5/25 reports on an internal document outlining plans to fire 80,000 VA employees.\nAmerican veterans demand an explanation from Doug Collins.\nHow does this benefit veterans and their families?\nWhat services will be affected?\nHow will benefits be affected? How will they be “improved”?\nCan Doug Collins provide an explanation? Or is Doug Collins lying to veterans?\nhttps://www.wmtw.com/article/sen-angus-king-reacts-to-job-cuts-coming-to-veterans-affairs/64059551\nAs a 100% disabled vet (after a long 10 year battle) why does not the spouse get full benefits? They aren’t covered by the VA, they do not get Dental, they have to us ChampVA which alot of physicians do not take. Seems it would make alot of sense if they were covered just like the veteran is and could use the VA benefits he/she is entitled to. When you break it down, the spouse really doesn’t get benefits that are needed. Why is this:\nDefine faster. My 95 yr old mother is still waiting . Her case was filed for Aid and Attendance in Virginia in March 2024 and has been ” open ” since October 2024. It is now March 2025. Since she is over 85 , they were supposed to expidite it. I think they hope she will die first.\nGood day Secretary Collins, I got to say that something needs to be done to stop trump and maga. Tariffs! Really! The cost of living is already ridiculous. Folks working 2 or 3 jobs to make rent. I came from a Military family. My Dad, Brother and Myself. How can this person justify what he doing to us? Now he claims the flag is his. Bull Shit Sincerely. Alan Anderson\nI am pretty sure it has slowed down dramatically since Jan 20th. It was a 15 day turn around between steps, now its months before we see any movement.\nThe bva wing of the VA are full of unscrupulous lawyers and liers denying everything they can from veterans that need help the most. They don’t even try and hide their lies. It’s abysmal and this Collins fellow looks ominous and definitely insincere. He’s a lap dog for Trump. Good luck Vets\nHad hearing test at local VA add was told witch hearing aids I was getting and I told him I didn’t want that brand and he ordered them anyway. I told him again I didn’t want that brand and he said they are what I need and try them. Twice going back for adjustment and still ringing in my ears. Went back because the right one quit working. He said he would send it off for repair and once again I explained I didn’t want them. He said it’s been over six months and he couldn’t send them back. Once again I told him he should have done that on day one. He had no words. So now I have to go to Costco and get a new pair of what I want.\nI would like to see the VA look into the current practice of hosing the retired military on their disability payments. Any veteran who serves long enough to be eligible for disability gets the full amount tax free. if you are retiree, you get hosed out of the amount of your disability right out of your retirement payment. This inequjity applies to anyone with less than 50 pct disability. This is a capricious and wholly unfair practice referred to as the “VA waiver”. They take your money that you earned, with one hand and give it back to you as your oh so generous disability payment. The kicker is it is tax free. BFD. The standard deduction accounts for that if you are not filing long form. In the years since I retired in 1991 I have been stiffed out of several hundred thousand dollars by this asinine waiver. your reward for extra decades of service is to get hosed out of your actual disability by having it removed from your earned retirement. Bravo! If they overpay you for any reason on the disability side, they come after you as if it was not your own money in the first place. Honestly speaking, other than a slight tax advantage, there is NO disability for the military retiree should he fall under fifty percent. I would have more than my presenet 40 pct, but you can only fight them for so long before you just give up. Someone in power ought to look at the so called VA waiver and return fairness to those of us who served long and faithfully and are treated like second class citizens compared to those who did not stay til retirement and get the entire amount without any money coming out of their p;ockets.\nDear Mr. Secretary, At the VA here in Atlanta, they have a third party reviewing xrays. We used to be ale to view the reports and images on MyHealthEVet but now, we are unable to see either of those because of third party review. Those are our records and the y should be put into our records and allow us access to them so that we can see and understand what’s going on. If a third party is used, it must be made clear that the images and reports belong to the veteran and must be available for the veteran to have access to. Also, the VA uses some kind of strange mathematical formula to determine disability ratings. They like to brag about the fact that they aways err on the side of the veteran. That is an absolute lie. Can anything be done to change the formula that they use to determine ratings?\nDear Mr Secretary; I had a dental procedure done in Dec 2024,that I had to pay out of picket for. I mailed in the proper form 10-320 for reimbursement, with explanation and receipts. Today they are telling me I can appeal it. This isn’t how the President set community care. Go to any doctor pay for it and get reimbursed. Needs to be fixed! $1500. For a root canal.\nAre Vietnam vets claims given quicker consideration because of advanced age?\nAre Vietnam veterans claims addressed in a different manner than others? I.E. advanced age given more consideration?\nI am an 81 year old Vietnam veteran with 13 years military service (Infantry and Intelligence) and another 17 years working in DIA and the Old Soldiers Home.\nI know used car salesmen with better pitches than this. You should resign rather than allow several thousand VA employees to be summarily fired. It is hard for me to believe that you were a military chaplain. You are a disgrace to the uniform you wore and should be ashamed of yourself. Do the right thing and resign.\nToday March 2, 2025 White house Froze VA funding! I am deeply sad and just beyond words as to how horribly cruel it is of our own government to freeze funding for the VA.\nHas the President or his $ slashers stepped inside a VA hospital recently??? If they did they would witness many America Loving Veterans who have suffered severe atrocities of war or put their lives on the line for the benefit of all Americans to live safer lives. These same veterans are waiting and waiting and waiting for the serious medical care they need! They are all suffering in fear of dying in the hospitals because our government is showing a callous, uncaring temperament towards these hero’s!\nIt’s not just that many are in pain waiting for surgeries, it’s that the anxiety and panic amongst everyone, personnel included are at a high pitch!

That’s thousands of families suddenly without an income and millions of veterans carelessly put at risk.\nThis will mean longer waits for medical appointments, fewer VA home loans, more homeless veterans, longer claims, and worse PTSD support for vets in need. Of course, Trump isn’t just breaking our commitment to veterans for no reason. All of this chaos is an attempt to give a $2 trillion handout to billionaires .\nThat’s the Republican agenda in a nutshell: More for billionaires, less for vets.\nThis isn’t what people voted for.

Reading all these comments it is hard to understand when I took my job to heart and gave it my all. It is a shame that all of you have to play a waiting game. Gold Star Wife\nInstead of American Taxpayers being forced to thank Veterans for their “service”, Veterans should be forced to thank American Taxpayers for their money. Veterans are a fat and self-entitled class of government-dependent parasites whose very existence is unAmerican.\nYou pos you veterans are parasites? WTF are you talking about asshole us veterans put our lives on the line so you can live your cushy life.\nIt’s obvious you never served your country, you are probably on welfare sucking the tits of American taxpayers. You sir should fu$k off.\nMr. Bender, I do hope that you will be able to allow your anger to eventually dissipate and know that Veterans are citizens who chose to volunteer to enter military service. As a five year old child, I was sitting on my father’s lap watching President Kennedy giving his speech after taking the oath of office. I was struck by his presentation and especially when he said “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what can you do for your country”. President Truman served in WW1 as an Army Captain of artillery, his unit was in combat throughout the war in France, President Kennedy was the Commanding Officer (in the Navy) of the PT-109, in WW2 which was engaged in seek and destroy missions in the South Pacific. President Lyndon Johnson was a Navy Lieutenant Commander who served in Australia and the South Pacific during WW2. My father volunteered for the Army in 1950 and served in the Korean War as a Medic in the 23rd Infantry Regiment. He was in the invasion force that landed at Inchon; he was wounded three times in separate battles and was awarded the Bronze Star with’V’ for Valor in late 1952. He was a quiet Veteran and was simply a citizen who went to War as it was his duty to serve. He and the millions of other citizens that have served were all honorable individuals and your ugly statement demeans their sacrifices.\nRepublicans haven’t told the truth since president Ford.\nSomeone is bitter…..Thank you for your taxpayer money. It will help provide the much-needed medical care after putting our lives on the line for ungrateful people like you. People like you assume you’re safe and secure because you are in the United States, the police, the FBI, etc. are a barricade and will protect us. Let me ask you this, who protects them? What are they going to do when a military-like Russia’s or China’s attack us? Do you think the police are going to be able to stop them?? Negative my ungrateful friend it takes young men and women like the ones in our military and our veterans to take the fight to our enemies thus returning to keep America safe. So next time, instead of running your mouth and being bitter towards what our country and its citizens have promised to provide us for our willingness to put our lives on the line, say thank you and move on!\nMy dad’s va check. Is short 1900 dollars they told him that the program that pays him for at home help care is being cut? I want answers and another thing got cut also they told hi m it was an executive order\nGood video, although I don’t necessarily believe what he says about the press and Doge, and current VA actions certainly aren’t a positive for we veterans. In addition, your actions as a Representative and current actions by Trump & Doge certainly make me, and others question whether we can believe you. But for now, I certainly hope you’re right. If not, you’ll get this video sent right back with a remark that his word isn’t worth the space it occupies.\nDirector Collings is a joke; he doesn’t have a clue. The most recent round of cuts has impacted my VA healthcare in two ways. First, I was to have a laser ablation procedure in my throat in April. When I called the VA yesterday, I was told that the contract for the laser machine had been cancelled due to the Trump/Musk/ Collins initiative. (Several of the hospitals in the area have a lease agreement to share the machine to reduce the cost. Now the hospital is waiting to find out when and if the contract can be renegotiated.\nSecond, I have two VA compensation claims on hold evidently because the DOGE administration let go the workers who are assisting with the claims process.\nNow the administration has rescinded their idiotic decisions, but the damage is done.\nMy procedure is delayed, and my claims are further delayed.\nWhat the administration is doing is fraudulent and a disservice to our veterans.\nDenying and/or reducing benefits for which Vets have qualified- especially when they have been receiving those benefits and relying on them- is cruel and un-American. Equally cruel and unwise is curtailing of survivor benefits. Who will want to serve this country when all incentives to do so are removed entirely? Also, once the disability is designated, along with the qualifying percentage, and the Vet is receiving compensation from the VA, it is unconscionable to reduce or curtail compensation on which that Vet relies. I am aware that some Vet benefits appear to be windfalls. However when time served earning what is essentially a minimum wage is considered, this seeming “windfall” looks more like appreciation for service. In addition, I have to note that disparaging and smug comments, (made by Vets who are not experiencing problems with benefits), are inappropriate and not in accordance with the spirit of service. Sanguine comments that mock and dismiss the harm caused by indiscriminate denial of benefits to fellow Vets says a lot about the integrity of the commenter. I would not choose to be in a situation wherein I would have to, as a service member, rely on such an individual to honor their oath and commitment.\nYour extreme right views and support for all Trump’s wants and desires and your stint with Georgia’s 9th Congressional District, one of the most Republican districts in the country, belie your claim that no cuts will be made to the VA system. And your support of DOGE, claiming that they are doing exactly what is necessary is laughable. Rolling Stone reports: “Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins’ tenure is off to a rocky start. The former Georgia congressman and unapologetic Donald Trump loyalist began by releasing a series of videos assuring that “despite the rhetoric, there would be no cuts at VA.” These videos preceded two rounds of layoffs at the department — first, 1,000 employees, many of them veterans, and then another 1,400 last week. Notably, Collins was not being forced to make these cuts by Trump or the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Instead, he appears to be slashing VA jobs simply to win favor with Trump and Elon Musk.”\nYou may not like Rolling Stone, but even the AP has reported: “VA pauses billions in cuts lauded by Musk as lawmakers and veterans decry loss of critical care. The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday. ”\nI could quote many more news outlets, but you would simply falsely state they are all false claims. I give up.\n“Extreme right views” is all these veterans need to hear. You are a fake news consumer, aka Pravda Propaganda. Do some basic research. Your cognitive dissonance won’t let the facts in. Yes, the VA is notorious for their delay, deny and die ideology with it comes to veteran benefits. I’ve been fighting the VA for ten years. The battle continues. I will beat them at their own game.\nThe Democrat Communist Party Pravda Propaganda machine feeds us nothing except FEAR PORN. Fear is an emotional reaction. Using Critical thinking skills, logic and commonsense is the cure. Fight, Fight, Fight and win.\nMy heart goes out to Vets like Malcolm (who wrote on Malcolm February 28, 2025 at 09:01), and :\n“VA Secretary Doug Collins, I was exposed to Agent Orange while I was stationed at (Udon) Thailand in 1974, I have developed Leukemia due to my exposure…The VA just reduced my compensation on chronic lymphoma leukemia from 100% to 0%….My anxiety went through the roof”.\nI am a registered nurse formerly employed by the VA. Meddling with the disability qualification requirements and percentages is CRUEL, SENSELESS, UNWISE, and just WRONG. If they are eliminated or reduced (and they should not be), then the Vets or their survivors whom are already qualified should not be denied the disability benefits earned and that they have been receiving. It is not wise to eliminate any of the few incentives for Americans to enter the military, as it is. They give life and limb. How can this be happening in the United States of America?\nThank you, Barbie Roelofs, for speaking out. At 74 that was devastating news. I’m sure all of these comments fall on deaf ears…\nWhat about Health programs?\nNot to be trusted. Trump will push him to eat his words. Especially since VA personnel are being disrespected and “fired” by the thousands.\nThank you Mr. Collins. May God Bless you in your job as new VA Secretary.\nWOW, what a used car salesman presentation\nKeep it up va I go to Hampton va for my\nTreatment and meds thanks\nFor the service sir no complaints and wife gets her champ va everything is great for her\nSir, I think you need to rescind your assurances that veterans benefits would not be cut.\nthe CBO is beating the drum again this year for reduction or elimination of va disability pay.\nThey do this annually and cause much angst among veterans.\nIt appears to me that if their scheme is enacted, it drive thousands of widows into poverty\nbecause of the loss of Total disability by their husband and concomitantly DIC.\nVeterans who have been receiving IU 100% for years have been unable to establish IRAs’\nand other retirement instruments. They are unable to work. They also are uninsurable\nfor life insurance because of their disabilities.\nI voted for Donald Trump, I can say factually that the veterans community are re-thinking\ntheir decision. I am 100% p/t from Vietnam. There is a tidal wave coming, these ill advised\nproposals will pave the way for the Democrats to retake the house and senate.\nI can state unequivocably that if these idiotic actions become reality I will be changing parties.\nIs this really what these bureaucrats want for disabled veterans\nLOL. Trump worked hard for over eight years to tell the world that he would dismantle everything great about America. Real Americans warned you a thousand times. You failed America with your votes for Trump. Own it.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, I was exposed to Agent Orange while I was stationed at Udorn Thailand in 1974, I have developed Leukemia due to my exposure…The VA just reduced my compensation on chronic lymphoma leukemia from 100% to 0%….My anxiety went through the roof\nImagine your 1SG letting another 1SG come into your company and discharging Soldiers at will. Collins let Musk do that. Proof that Collins won’t even protect his own workforce for the benefit of veterans.\nImagine your 1SG sucking up to the CSM like Collins sucks up to Trump.\nSecretary Collins … I would like to apologize, sir, for the need to say what I am about to say. Simply stated, I do not believe a word you said. On the one hand, with only a month on the job, you have not had a lot of time to prove your loyalties. On the other hand, we all know your reputation and, to be frank, do not believe for one minute that your priorities and loyalties are to the Veterans who defended our country and whose sacrifices have made your job possible in the first place. On behalf of millions of American Veterans, living and dead, I challenge you to prove to us, in the same way that we have proven our loyalty to our country, that you intend to be loyal to us. That’s it in a nutshell. Forgive me again, sir, but now the ball is in your court. History will record for all time where your loyalties lie.\nI second what John Washbush said here 100 percent. History and The Lord both will record your actions!\nMr Secretary Collins, I would like to extend my sincere THANK YOU to Ms. Grace Brumley, from the International Direct Deposit Team, VA Regional Office 351 – Muskogee, OK, for solving the 14 month long delay in my payments by getting Electronic Transfer rather than paying by checks being issued by the Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Office https://www.va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/\nMs. Grace Brumley exemplified your challenge to ” focus relentlessly on customer service and convenience” and I hope that your office will recognize her efforts to “solve REAL PROBLEMS” being faced by Veterans in receiving payments or other services we have earned.\nThank you!!!\nDr. PDG, Jakarta, Indonesia\nStop doing videos and stand up to Trump and tell us what you’re doing instead of on a video. I do not trust this.\nWhy aren’t you doing press conferences instead of videos? These one-way videos make it seem like the director is afraid soemone will ask questions and demand real data.\nWhy are they firing most researchers ones that are in the middle of studies that was already paid fo outside the VA makes no sense and all was to try and help the veterans i thought that was your job to help the veterans i was in the hospital on the 24 th. And everyone was scared about having a job if you think that helps the veterans your wrong and i voted for trump.\nWelcome to the Find Out stage of FAFO.\nWhy is the VA not properly paying its Community Care Providers, specifically Therapeutic Massage. We took a 24% rate cut in October of 2023 in the middle of the worst inflation we have ever seen. This caused many providers to cancel their contracts and others to reduce the number of veterans served. This action is directly responsible for the suffering of our Veterans. Please fix this problem!\nVA Secretary Collin’s ….DOGE= Dog “Shit”…They are cutting essential Personnel, How are us as Veterans suppose to get the care we need when the VA Facilities & Community Care are empty…..These are some of the most dangerous & corrupt cuts that ever could happen…..Rag-Bag Elon Musk(not even From our United States)..?? You need to explain yourself Sir, when you say you agree what (So called DOGE) is doing or are you committed to standing up for myself & my Brothers & Sisters (Veterans)…these cut @ VETERAN AFFAIRS… Secretary Collin’s has done nothing to speed up anything (except THE AGENDA) Veterans want “REAL ANSWERS” not the Politically Correct answers…..Our Veterans Employees deserve better than this Crazy Shit that is happening to them & thier Families….Lead,Follow or get out of the way!!!\nListening the emotional outbursts of liberals are annoying and bothersome. Grow up do some research.\nWhy are the VA facilities empty?\n“Collins said he would seek to bring more employees into the office rather than allowing them to telework, though he noted he was bound by collective bargaining agreements that represent 80% of the VA workforce. He similarly pledged to follow labor contracts and all other legal processes when seeking to fire more department staff, though he said he would ultimately not be restricted in getting rid of malfeasant workers. “\nThe VA demeans veterans when it does not permit admission into the VA medical system because of an income above some low level.\nI hope Doug can help with the LOGIN.GOV over reach of Veterans personal information. I’m absolutely disgusted with the VA as it pertains to that, specifically!\nThe VA is indeed clearing cases faster than before, but only because they are declining more than ever. Veterans hospitals are not improving, they are getting worse, The VA hospital I attend is very short handed on doctors and I learned yesterday that 2 more of our really good doctors are leaving the VA. Loosing Doctors and the hiring freeze is causing a 2 to 4 month wait to get an appointment. I applied for counselling at my VA due to depression and am having to wait almost 2 months to see a councilor. I have been fighting for my VA disability since 2010 and am still being denied. I can truly understand why Veterans commit suicide.\nNot worried about privacy info being exposed. After all, Equifax was hacked to the tune of 143 million citizens, so it figures that all of my info is already floating around the dark web somewhere!\nYour living in a friggin dream world!!! The VA in both NJ and wills Barre have done everything and did DESTROY\nMy ability to pass any background check by leaking out flat out toxic gaslighting lies all were from a fake woman rep 1 when I used to live in Jersey and now in wills Barre pa both were not related to each other but the pa VA hates vets so much when I applied for my PTSD and my broken bones from army they will call either 2 things “Nutzo or slutz”!! They deliberately infected me with a toxin from a surgical instrument in wills Barre pa and made me so ill I couldn’t even walk! The top brass gives orders to make sure you don’t get your benefits and if they find out you got them before admin finds out they litterly make sure you never go there again, so I tried waiting 2 years and went to one in upstate NY not only did they tried to lie to me, they wanted a surgery to go to the Bronx NYC for the dental surgery that would “take months” to recover when I said you know how can I have surgery when there is no teeth to pull? I knew the last wills Barre didn’t pay the community care dentist and I had to call a congressman to get the va to pay the dentist that and I’m guessing did not sit well with the top brass in Willsk Barre so a vendetta was made without my knowledge, so it’s a good guess that they want to give you the same dental treatment that John Gotti got in prison. The gov gave him cancer in a dental filling, and that’s what I’m guessing they have tried to do to me, this was a warning for me never to go back to Any Va!!! Willsk Barre is run like the Mafia.!!!!\nRep Collins , I not writing this to complain about the service of care providers in our community but, lol I have one small issue that we don’t have a VA hospital in Anchorage or Fairbanks,Alaska. I am lucky enough to be able to go to Chief Andrew clinic in Fairbanks and just to let you know I have received the best care I have ever received from VA. My issue is if I go to the VA clinic it’s over a damn computer and a nurse doing everything a Dr is supposed to do to help me. I don’t know how you feel about having to sit and talk to a doctor over a computer. When just down the street I get to see a doctor in person and God as my witness I can say that I have never been seen and treated like I’m a King ever time. We’re wasting our money on a clinic that works over a computer and I don’t see why we should pay for that kind of treatment. I would like to see that my fellow Veterans get the same treatment that I do thank you for listening to me. Per capital we have more veterans than any other state. Thanks Ron\nMr Collins , you are saying one thing , but in reality you do the opposite. I do not trust you, along with other veterans. You are allowing VA employees to be fired, possible changes in healthcare and disability. Whenever there are budget cuts, veterans are the first on the chopping block. Veterans do not want a yes man for the current administration. We want someone that will fight for us. We have earned every damn VA benefit. The current administration could care less about us. Trump is allowing an unqualified and unelected man to make decisions about the VA programs. Musk is the hit man for Trump and they are destroying everything that we know. You are either for veterans or you are not. Find your spine, voice and protect veterans. We have served our country through wars and conflicts. It is your responsibility to fight for us. Freedom is not free.\nGreat to that we got a Secretary that cares about Veterans. Let’s see if he’ll get us more than an annual 1-2% COLA increase. Congress goes and proposes a 40% pay increase for themselves and only about 10% served in the armed forces defending our country and the citizens of it.\nSome of us are deemed unemployable and struggle paycheck to paycheck. Like myself.\nI honestly don’t believe, or trust you.\nAs a Trump loyalist, your true allegiance is not to us, the veterans, but rather to the President.\nFrom your previous term, you should be well versed on the “Concurrent Pay” issue.\nWhy hasn’t this been taken care of. Even (then) Sen. Harry Reid made it his FIRST bill submission. It always gets buried.\nI was ripped off for half my 30 years of disabled retirement. When I received $400 for disabiliy, my meager enlisted retirement check was struck with a $400 deduction.\nPresident Lincoln established Concurrent Pay to help the enlisted soldier. It also was meant to put the responsibility of disabled Officers (then Aristocrats) on themselves. This is no longer close to fair today (although I have no idea why an officer gets 2-5 times more than this combat/retired/disabled Green Beret).\nShow us what you are made of. You should be our Governor or Senator. I hope you are the man I think you are.\nLead the charge, Sir!!! I have no dog in this fight as I’m now 100% (after a 29 year fight). But, our Brothers in Arms don’t deserve this.\nAnd, if President Trump wants to give away money, skip the people who won’t work and slide it over to us who have been screwed and fighting with our finger nails to get a fair shake. Otherwise, take care of the brothers behind me.\nGod Bless\nDe Oppresso Liber\nHe is correct. Many INSANE people who listen to FOREIGN CORPORATION MEDIA (Nearly every media source in USA) – most directly owned and paid by the WEF and it’s insane globalists.\nDOGE will make efficient, streamlined action. Good GOD, people: NONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER SAY ANYTHING TRUE. DO A SIMPLE SEARCH ON the company which owns your news station, which owns that, which owns that – you will find they are foreign companies.\nI am dating a 78 year-old veteran and I am 72 and all we do is argue because I’m a Trump supporter and he is not any throws in my face that this morning the president said he was going to cut the veterans benefits. What can I say back to him to quit listening to the fault narratives that are on the news but he said that Trump said it so can you clarify it for me?\nTell him that his statement is, as labeled by the great Gen. Swartzkoff…. “bovine scatology!” LOL! Just a thought! :D\nI’m a veteran and this administration has declared war on us… WHY?\nDo I believe that Collins has any control over the matter???…Hell No! Anyone who sits across the table from this president or Elon Musk will toe the line of the administration’s conjured up policies, regardless of whose lives they destroy. Wise up, and don’t be a party to this foolishness, Mister Collins.\nMy experience with the VA is that of honest people attempting to do their best with little time, resources, and management support. I pity them, but wholeheartedly thank and respect their dedication to. the cause.\nYou obviously don’t know Mr. Collins. He doesn’t cower to anybody. He shut down the Trump Impeachment with his legal prowess.\nYour experience with the VA is similar to mine, except I find several persons hanging around with seemingly nothing to do.\nI pray that God Almighty creates a special place in hell for anyone that wants to privatize the VA.\nDO you support the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025’s framework for restructuring, reducing and taking benefits and disability ratings from the veteran community ? Please answer this question.\nEnough of the Fake News lies: Project 25 is from a private organization. It has nothing to do with President Trump. Do some basic research.\nWill health care professionals be let go? The VA has made vast improvements in last 10 years or so. I was dealing with the medical issues. The whole operation seemed to be chaotic. Nobody would return phone calls. Sometimes there would be a neurologist on staff. Other times the nearest neurologist was in Buffalo. You never knew what to expect. I really dreaded dealing with the VA. I’d have to drive to the VA to get information or prescriptions or to get a simple question answered. Those days are over. Please don’t let them come back. You’ve made such great improvements. The VA has a new facility here (ROPC). I’ve had the same medical team for eight or so years now. The staff is friendly and concerned about my health. My meds arrive on time. And other vets I’ve talked with feel the same way. I can’t adequately express how much the VA has improved. The care I receive at the VA is better than civilian care (they seem to be going down hill). Please don’t let the VA slip back into chaos\nI was notified by my local VA that community care service is being eliminated. I had to cancel my next appointment. They said I could either go to the community care but then could not go to the VA. That doesn’t make sense. Now I have to drive an hour and a half to my closest VA instead of 2 blocks to local hospital. Also some of my appointments\nare further apart due to staff reductions??\nAlso since Trump started all of the funding cuts my medication deliveries have been stopping and I am constantly calling to straighten. Out the mess. Things just seem to not be working smoothly anymore.\nIn no way do I trust the current CIC, any of his appointees, and certainly not the “DOGE”. Looking for inefficiencies in all Federal government agencies is certainly a necessary endeavor, napalming those agencies is unacceptable and un-American.\nThey cut my benefits\nWhat? Are you kidding?\nWhat benefits were cut?\nExplain your situation, my benefits have not been touched. I don’t know where everyone is lying about their benefits being touched. Can you please give more details\nI got my disability cut from what they say is from 100% to 90% from apllying for the pact act and got cut from over $3800 to $2297 starting March 2025 and talking about going down to just over $2200 and wished I never put in for the fraud Pact Act to give others our money and I’m going to be homeless and starved to death and Unemployable that’s the thanks for our service is all we get and they hope we die before we get to 100% and decrease it. Just like the cadence says “they give you a hundred dollars and take back 99. I’m telling my grandchildren stay out of the military from grandad’s expeirience until they get the benefits right without the paper chase beuracracy\nYou didn’t know the Pact Act was a setup to do exactly what they did to you? If you were already 100% WHY did you file another claim??????\nYeah, you are a complete idiot for touching your claims after already having 100%\nThis is a sad day when people are on here rooting for this idiot from Georgia who is part of the problem. The Trump administration just fired the company that cleans the surgical tools in the operating room before they operate on a veteran they also just let go of the company who checks the radiation on the MRI and X-ray machines to make sure the veterans don’t get too much radiation. But some of you are on here praising this man they’re trying to sell the headquarters of the VA lol but they can actually sell the Federal building but they tried. And I see a couple people in their talking about give the man a chance you guys are pathetic. Cutting $80,000 jobs when the VA was already struggling and then you have somebody that is actually showing you they want to take veterans out anybody that voted for this crap is getting what they deserve.\nWhy is a company called Veterans Evaluation Services being used ? It has been my experiences with them to be a waste of time and “our” money ! All they have ever done is look at my VA records and confirm that my records are valid ! I’m sure that my 12 year old Grandson could do the same thing if I gave him access to my files ! And welcome aboard Secretary Collins !\nI really hope that I don’t get cheated as I been for 13 years, with concussion that has caused me demihelanation of brain,chronic high\nblood pressure, sleep apnea, seizures when anxiety is elevated and many others secondary disabilities.i have been unemployable since 2009 and not rated.\nI applied for an increase in my disability rating on 6/10/24. Since then I have received requests for employment info that I have responded to. However it seems I am in a loop without end. I respond and then receive another request, then I respond again. I feel that this is a delay tactic to avoid making a decision. It is frustrating to say the least. I hope with the leadership change with the VA that this can be resolved. I have always been grateful for the care I received through the VA, and by and large have been very pleased with the level of care its provided.\nCongratulations Secertary Collins on your new appointment. My husband was a veteran. He was shot in the head in Vietnam. He was in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. The VA took care of him for 55 years. Several years ago, a CT scan was done, and we found that injury took 50% of his brain. The VA paid for his rehab, education and ALL of his care. They even helped me through many difficult times. They hired him as an Educational Therapist and later as Prosthetic & Sensory Aid Services Representative. He was employed for many years and retired in 2000. We both felt that if he had been taken care of in the private sector he would not have survived near as long. The multidisciplinary team approach plus the knowledge related to veterans’ long problem lists allowed him to survive the 55 years. I realize there is waste in the VA and the waste needs eliminated. However, do not let anyone eliminate the system. It was certainly a blessing for him and me. Thank you.\nWhere is the waste? Elon Musk will gut everything and ask forgiveness later. You cannot encourage the reckless behavior of billionaires who have never known hardships. They don’t care what they cut as long as the number is big.\nYou are correct. Many INSANE people who listen to FOREIGN CORPORATION MEDIA (Nearly every media source in USA) – most directly owned and paid by the WEF and it’s insane globalists.\nDOGE will make efficient, streamlined action. Good GOD, people: NONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER SAY ANYTHING TRUE. DO A SIMPLE SEARCH ON the company which owns your news station, which owns that, which owns that – you will find they are foreign companies.\nActually I think you are a communist spy, trolling this site and spreading propaganda and lies, like a good little comrade. Please go take your cut and paste post and shove it.\nBottom line, a Vietnam draft dodger and a corporate welfare foreign national (the latter unelected) running and destroying our government and thus our country that we here lived and in some cases died for.\nSir, please don’t cave in to the spoiled Brat Billionaires who never served and don’t give one shit about us veterans. Anyone that calls POWs loosers can rot in hell – yes I’m talking about Captain Bonespurs Trump, he said that, check tape.\nI can only pray that current VA leaders have the spine and backbone that politicians left at the door.\nI am a 1980s Cold Warrior till I die, and you poster are in fact a commie if you support a Putin, Xi, Kim loving president.\nAnd I call BS on your post. It simply isn’t true, and you are probably a Russian spawed bot anyhow.\n(yea, Musk isn’t even a real American, he’s from South Africa and only naturalized in 2002, holds citizenship in 3 different countries, so yea, where does his allegiance lay?)\nThank you for the information, transparency and congratulations on your appointment. I’m a veteran, but also a proud spouse of a VA employee (also veteran). I’m hopeful that in the coming days you and your leadership team will be providing transparency to VA employees and staff so we can anticipate any future changes. I know the situation is changing daily and quite fluid and I’m sure we aren’t the only family looking forward to this information. We appreciate what you are trying to do. Best wishes.\nfellow veterans please lets try to mind our words and stand by if we have nothing positive to contribute on this message forum- lets try to work together as i write this their are 1,955 comments on here and some are well intentioned, some are revealing our divide amongst our sides. I am on neither side I am with all of you as fellow Americans and veterans. This situation we are living through can be overcome but we must work together, remember our discipline and memories of how we work together as a team even in the most dire of situations. We must hope and expect the best from our current chain of command as our success or failure is coalescent on their decisions and actions. Health, fortitude, peace and humor as we navigate these next few years but above all optimism that things will work out.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nHey Santos, you going to be so polite when your orange Jesus deports you?\nCongratulations Secertary Collins on your new job. I see all these comments and veterans are confused and need their questions answered. I see Kirt Love postings and he has many unanswered questions that need your support. Why doesn’t someone from your office get back to Kirt Love for some real questions to get answered. Please follow up. Ed Bryan\nCongratulations Mr. Collins on your appointment and your transparency. I receive excellent care all throughout the VA – way better than civilian care. Now, to all the negativity a select few continue to post – We are all proud that President Trump is back (I repeat, BACK!) in the White House.\nNo, we are not all proud that white supremacists who want to end the Constitution are back in the oval. You sure don’t speak for me nor millions of other patriots who want to PRESERVE the Constitution.\nI’m dealing with a really bad case of bone spurs. LOL\nGuess what over 50% of the people working at the VA are not Veterans, they don’t even know what a Veteran has done for this country, their families. You work somewhere, your boss ask or the book keeper as what you did that week before you get paid. Hey you can tell them and will tell them to keep your job. Realize that a lot of people took advantage of the virus, stopped going in to work, but continued to get paid by the taxes you and I pay to the government, then got another job or moved to an foreign beach and send in work by computer if at all. Notice how you can’t get anyone to answer the Phone. Wake up, they need to go and only those who care and want to work should be kept.\nI wrote to you last week, I have been a claims agent accredited for years 20 or so. The problem is here in Arizona Doctors are needed in community care. However, a chiropractor in Camp Verde put his application in again to help and was turned down and not answered as to why, he has to be creditionaled only by one company and that company want you to pay them and you have to take all of the insurances they have or you can’t be part Of them. Kick back in sure. For all of central and no. As there is one chiropractor. This is wrong and should be checked. Verde Valley Family Chiropractor Kyle French was at one time signed with VA, but stopped working for a while family diffaculties. Now they won’t let him help. Hope you can find out the problem. All doctors and nurses are needed in this area and across the country.\nI watched the video several times and all I heard was “the media is telling you things I don’t like. Well, nuh-uh!” but in a folksy voice.\nAgreed. What a waste of hot air.\nThe Veterans Health Administration is America’s largest integrated health care system, providing care at 1,380 health care facilities, including 170 medical centers and 1,193 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity (VHA outpatient clinics), serving 9.1 million enrolled Veterans each year.\nI suspect that many of the negative, fear-mongering comments here are people with memory deficits. As a caregiver of a 100% disabled Veteran since Vietnam era, I have seen the VA rise and fall with each administration. I distinctly remember the previous short 4-years under the first Trump administration as being a breath of fresh air after the Obama administration’s middle finger to Veterans. By the end of his first term, President Trump had managed to clear the backlog, get enough doctors and medical specialists hired and streamlined the process of getting care. https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-putting-veterans-first/ Within just a few months of Biden in charge, it went right back to the boondoggle of the pre-Trump years.\nThe VA is a HUGE beaurocracy with multiple layers of services for every type of veteran from WWII to present. If you expect the system to change in 30-days, you’re only kidding yourself. You can yell or you can do something. Every county is represented by a Veteran’s Service Officer. Every county is represented by both State and US Congressmen and Congresswomen. Most, but not all, VA employees serve veterans and will do everything possible to assist you with information, processes and procedures, communications and expectations. If you’re not a jerk, one or all of these avenues are open to you. Even if you are a jerk, most will still try to help deserving veterans and their families.\nDoug Collins and Donald Trump have been elected to try to straighten out the mess once again. Work with them instead of against them and you will see a dramatic improvement once the waste, fraud, abuse and red tape of previous administrations are cleared out of the way. They truly do need to “clean house” at VA to make room for dedicated people with the will, training and dedication to help with this mission. There are a lot of them but we need 100% mission-driven patriots from the front door to the top floor and no slackers need apply.\nIn what bizarre world is A Vietnam War draft dodger who badmouths POWs, Veterans, even service members killed in a helicopter accident, a patriot???\nOh, and his buddy Musk isn’t even a real American. He’s an immigrant from South Africa naturalized in 2002, look it up. So yea, also not a patriot.\nThey are both self-serving billionaires with billionaire cronies, who don’t give two shits about Vets. That means you Reader, regardless of which party you vote for. These guys are gonna screw you in a heartbeat.\nHow can you tell a republican is lying? His lips are moving.\nCollins may believe he’s telling the truth but as soon as Con Man Trump determines the time is right, he’ll screw all veterans. You should expect nothing less from the draft dodger. And when he does change his mind, Doug Collins will be right there kissing the ring and do nothing to support veterans. It’s almost like I can see the future – right Doug.\nAs a veteran enjoying the benefits I earned after serving for over 32 years I can personally attest to how great The Community Care program is for when I need care that’s not offered at my local clinic. This program was introduced during President Trump’s first term. I can also remember how bad the VA was during former President Obama’s administration whenever I attempted to get care. Thankfully I had healthcare insurance through my civilian job. May I ask if you’re a veteran? If so, what has been your experience?\nYou may want to research that further. It’s so tiresome that people are always looking in the rearview mirror to vilify past leadership in an effort to elevate the current traitor, even if it is a lie. Pres. Obama signed it into law!\nThe “program started in 2014 following a scandal over wait times at Veterans Affairs facilities. The program was created through the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill that was signed by President Barack Obama.”\nFact Check: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-veterans-free-health-care/\nFact Check: https://www.factcheck.org/2018/03/trump-veterans-choice-program/\nGlad to hear you are having a good experience and it is working well for your healthcare needs; however, it is not the same for everyone, everywhere.\nWhere I currently live it is not efficient. Females are farmed out to the community for basic healthcare, and the claims are routinely denied for stupid reasons, regardless of an authorization. Community care is limited to a monopoly healthcare system, and Veterans are not always treated with kindness or respect. The whole community care program is also untimely.\nFor example, getting a mammo or other female care should not require multiple intermediaries to get an auth and schedule the care. Furthermore, if a mammo is abnormal, and follow-up is required with further films or an ultrasound, etc. It’s back to waiting for the process, again.\nThat said, if I receive an unfortunate diagnosis and need to navigate community care program for cancer care, etc., it would be a nightmare. In my line of work, I saw what Veterans had to deal relative to unpaid community care claims, etc. The process could definitely be streamlined.\nNOTE: Any misogynists or sexists who feel the need to make negative comments about female Veterans can keep them. I’ve already heard it, seen it, and experienced it for years.\nThank you for setting it straight. I get so tired of hearing what Trump has done when it iks just an extension of Obamas work and I have been in VA care the whole time so I have experienced it personally\nI know of a lady who works for the Social Security. She told my wife that on the horizon are works in place so that we have to choose between SSN and our Veterans benefits. Maybe this is a rumor started in house to provoke us to behave badly. I trust my government, and that this is just a silly rumor perpetrated by opponents of our duly elected president.\nDoge is not a government entity. I insist that you stop working with a bunch of criminals.\nThey are not vetted or have security clearances. They are a bunch of egomaniac punks.\nDodge serves as the pleasure of the President. Legal\nAt the pleasure of a convicted felon, lifelong grifter, and someone convicted of sexual assault. Why would I trust him?\nThe predator in chief serves at the pleasure of an incompetent nepo baby. Clear the GOP lies from your ears and look at what’s in front of you. Donald Trump doesn’t care about you and never will. Elon Musk comes from a family of billionaire emerald mine owners who were literally proud members of the nazi party.\nI cannot believe how easily so many of you gave our country to a bunch of billionaire oligarchs who are cozying up to mass murdering dictators. Victor Orban, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un were the only people voting against the UN resolution condemning Putins illegal invasion of Ukraine, and your idiot president joined them.\nCongrats Mr. Secretary\nWould you please consider the letter on Panama Veterans submitted by 34 members of congress to identify Panama Veterans under the Pact Act/\nHe is lying.\nSenators (all Rep except Hawley from\nMO) rejected an amendment to the budget outline proposed on February 20.\nThe amendment brought by a Democratic senator I believe From Connecticut requested the VA healthcare funding be at the same level. It is now to not reduce those levels in the new budget. It was rejected by all, except that one Republican senator. All the Democrat senators and the independence voted for the amendment. They want funding for veterans healthcare to at least stay where it is now and to not be cut.\nA lot of people claim to be for the military and for veterans but when it comes down to it, they are not. They are for lining their own pockets. Rolling Stone has a great article about how doge has not found fraud in the VA all they’ve done to save money as fired, doctors nurses office workers and things like that.\nGoing to pitch a idea for everyone coming here. Instead of you posting once\nand walking away, look for others you share similarities and unite.\nVA does not want any of you to rally. They want you to remain individuals\non here and bicker. That way they can claim there is no common interest\nand nothing to answer.\nBest possible place to try: Change.org and set up a petition of things you all\nwould support. Single idea, easy to agree on. Dont write a book, Get the\nfirst or second idea running with a few thousand on board. Then VA cant\nignore you. Like “Open door policy at VA”.\nRight now, they just want to see who the loudest people are to ignore. This\nis a test bed on who to turn away or frustrate. Even the service groups. These\nfolks want to rule by keeping you all “Armies of one” No matter how good the\nidea, VA only responds to numerical support – angry mob.\nBeen doing this 28 years, watched what hasnt worked. Been pitching this to\nadvisory committee to bypass there own deadlocks. You only have to be a team\nfor that one idea folks. Regardless of personality.\nOther wise, sec of VA Doug Collins is going to ignore every one of you. He is\nalready doing that with me. All talk, same old song and dance as the others.\nIts easier than you think folks. Commit to a idea, and unite on it.\nI just got my second denial letter for VA referred community care since there are no in-house women’s programs where I live. As a 100% disabled vet, I’m once again a subpar citizen simply because I don’t have male genitalia. I get to bleed to death from a military related injury. Thanks guys!\nHi, thanks for commenting. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance.\nI agree!!! Same here! I don’t even bother to get female care anymore because it is an effing nightmare! Every time I was sent to the community, it was denied and not paid, regardless of a prior auth. Optum is notorious for denying payment even after they give an auth. I finally escalated it, with all the receipts, and nothing.\nHow many current and planned positions have already been lost since January 20th?\nHow many families have uprooted to move for a promised position only to have it canceled since January 20th?\nCan you explain why a pharmacist can change the dosage of medication prescribed by a heart specialist?\nSeems a bit strange.\nCongratulations on your new job. I am happy to know that you were selected for this job. I know that you will do great for us veterans.\nFor years democrats have controlled the VA. Now that President Trump and his team are in charge, democrat vets are singing the same disrespectful songs of the fake news radicals. (See comments) Secretary Collins has been in office for less that two weeks and they are already saying he is a failure. For God’s sakes men, give him a chance. The entire administration has only had a month to improve things, and the improvements in every area are significant. God bless you, President Trump, and your entire team. AMERICA FIRST!!!\nBernie Sanders and President Biden have done fine jobs on helping veterans but you want to believe a draft dodging LOSER and his lies over actual proof of those first 2 men obviously supporting veterans. I mean you do remember that President Biden had a son in the military he lost? All of DJT family dodged serving their countries, even his granddaddy first immigrated here to dodge his country, Austria’s draft to come here. You do know that means every time he dodged his draft other men were selected to go in his place? You’re worship of one of the most greedy money hungry loving conman actually makes me sick. You’re the type to have joined a hunting party to go after escaped slaves before and during the Civil War, just reading your comment tells me a lot about the type of person you really are. Probably joined the military to get to kill more than animals too, well I joined to help defend my country and to get more education and to travel the world and learn about different cultures etc\nShut down the VA go to medicare. I’ve been waiting for a consult for 3 months and no one can say why. They have lost some of my records when they can find any. Doing away with the VA is not cutting benefits. I can almost write a book of the disrespect and l ack of care I’ve received from the VA. https://news.va.gov/138326/va-secretary-doug-collins-veterans-benefits/\nAMEN!!! EXCELLENT reply, Ron!!\nI only hold them to the promises they made. No one forced them to claim they would lower groceries on Day 1, they said that . I say hold them to it or they lied for your vote and you still back them? Sad\nYou people are the biggest bunch of crybaby whiners I’ve ever seen. Not a positive comment in the bunch of you about what good the VA does; just complaints and “give me more”. Try a little gratitude for what good comes your way from the VA instead of all this entitled bull**\nEntitled? Are you even a veteran or just commenting to be a good little DT bootlicker? You do realize that some of these people have been waiting for decades to be able to get benefits like healthcare that they need in order to be alive? I know this one guy that said he’d fought for 20 years because he had to dump toxic waste for the military, but he lied about his age to join and they did something with his service record and he’s got witnesses etc but they’ll literally wait them out to death so they don’t have to pay out\nRoger That, Doug!!! It’s really difficult to believe that most of these brainwashed, Crybaby Whiners could have ever served our Republic with service in our Armed Forces!!!\nGood soldiers are not afraid to ask questions. Some of the people that you are censoring may have a question that you did not think of to answer. Stop badmouthing these heroes who are exercising the right that they fought for.\nThis sounds like the same attitude that our Vietnam Veterans received after the war when years later we found that their complaints were real.\nWell Doug (Collins), is this how you treat disabled Veterans. As “crybaby whiners”. This is why you should be last to be the Sectary of DVA. You finally responded to my request to view these complaints. “Not a positive comment in the bunch of you” makes you look like the biggest “crybaby whiners”.\nThe comments I made are relative to the community care process, not the VA care. The VA has provided excellent care and is my preference. My providers are outstanding and caring and very professional. Unfortunately, the facility doesn’t provide a lot of female care.\nOf course, this will be a reason for misogynists and sexists to vilify female Veterans.\nMy dad died in a VA hospital because of a lack of human resources. He sat in the ER for over 6 hours missing his medical golden window to survive and then spent 30 days in ICU with sepsis where he died. Veterans like my father deserve THE BEST.\nSo why, are so many veterans being intimidated about what they’re doing at their job. So excuse me for not believing a word you say, because you don’t really know it’s not you, is that criminal in the White House Trump and his pet muskrat, that will destroy veterans lives. It already has disrupted them by forcing them to answer by Monday night. I know a lot of veterans at the v. A, that I confused disturbed about what’s going on.So what do you have to say about that\nThank you for the comment. There are plenty of videos and quotes proving how little the current administration cares about veterans and anyone really\nRight on, Thomas! We have a right to ask questions. When I was an NCO, whenever a commander got in front of us for questions, I threw my hand up and encouraged my soldiers to do the same. Let’s keep doing the same thing. We are not a bunch of mindless infants. We are soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that answered the call. Ain’t scared of nothin’!\nThe 1991 agent orange Bill was pass for all Vietnam Veterans that had agent orange Health Problems. in 2002 the V.A said had boot on ground. Congress passed Years later to 12 miles off shore. Many Vietnam Veterans server pass 12 miles but are got agent orange and toxions . Please help us to get the back to the Vietnam service medal like it was in the 1991 agent orange bill for all Vietnam Veterans with Health Problems. Please help us. we are dieing out that need Benefits. that had got Bad Health Problems.

To vote for someone who has absolutely no integrity ,releases criminals from prison because they adore him , which is what he believes we all should do . Because after all he is the king . Money and power for him and his rich supporters is his agenda . The rest of us be damned . Shame on all of you!!\nI’m appalled by this gaslighting and it was a Democratic President that passed the PACT act and has helped veterans immensely and because his son was a veteran, President Biden obviously cared a great deal about us veterans, especially those of us who were disabled. I also remember Senator Bernie Sanders a liberal,(Independent/Democrat) doing a wonderful job when the VA was struggling with backlog by years and even decades in some cases. I myself am still struggling at 70% when they stole my silver fillings and replaced them with the then new composite crap that’s cured with a blacklight. The 70% is for the agoraphobia they caused but they also caused PTSD and aggravated all of the previous to my service, mental health disorders. I feel like they tried to make me a mindless thing they could control and the programming failed if I was 1 of 5 from my squadron all in the hospital the night of the Air Force’s Airman’s Ball with the 17th Commander of the Air Force attending (his wife started the digitized blue, white and gray in all shades ? BDU idea, like people don’t need to “blend” into sky, they’ll be seen, duh ???) for trying to end our lives early. Yeah I know I’m giving to much personal information but it’s partly due to my manic phase I’m in right now.\nHow anyone would trust a man who was well known not to pay his contractors, cheated on all 3 of his wives as an unrepentant adulterer after he vowed to honor and cherish them, lusted after his own daughters (there’s plenty of interviews that are cringe AF with him describing baby Tiffany’s rack size and legs being like Marla’s and the Katie Johnson interview describing her looking like Ivanka and he made her wear a blonde wig when she was with him and to wear gloves so she couldn’t get any DNA from him because he had to see them get destroyed after use, he was careful not to leave behind evidence and she was a Epstein girl and happened to be close to his daughter in age at the time, he also stole her purity according to her account of their last meeting) and y’all think he didn’t and doesn’t LIE to y’all EVERY SINGLE TIME he opens his yuge gaping mouth?\nSir, what you described is literally what the Biden administration and democrats did. President Trump and Mr. Collins have only been in office for weeks, doing more that Biden did in four years. Shouldn’t we wait and give them a chance to set things right again, or are we going to continue to allow our feelings to dictate blame without facts? Personally, I am very confident that President Trump and his cabinet members will do everything in their power to correct what is wrong and then build it back better. Because the majority of the voting population to include a lot of the Democratic legislation are finally acknowledging how criminally unjust he was treated during his first term and are now supporting him. Don’t you think its time to trade our feelings in for observable merit-based accomplishments?\nNO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT CONCURRENT BENEFIT DOUBLE STANDARD …. VETERANS WHO EARNED BOTH DESERVE BOTH\nMr. Secretary,\nYou are not telling the truth; Veteran’s Administration staff are being terminated by email. You know this, if you really stand behind every veteran then you also need to be standing behind every VA staff member who has been terminated by the weakness and constant lying of Donald Trump. Every veteran served by the VA has been on the front line, in harm’s way they trusted the soldier, the marine, the airman, and the sailor next to them. It is time that you not only step forward, that you step up and call out the ignorance that this coming from the White House.\nVeterans have paid the IRS federal & State taxes for many years. I have paid taxes since I was in college until I retired in my 50s. Will veterans who pay no tax on VA benefits get a “DOGE Dividend Check”? I’m certain the IRS used the tax money for fraud, that veterans have paid as civilians, and we deserve a refund, as well.\nJust curious, has our care gone to crap becasue DOGE is trying to make it better? I used to have great care at my local VA healthcare facility. I believe a big chunk of the staff is gone. So how is that helping vets? I think waiting over 2 months for a Urinary Tract Infection is unacceptable. If you look online it states the average wait time to be seen is 2-15 days. Oh, and don’t fall for the lie of using the local urgent cares. The VA doesn’t cover the labs if they decide to do a urinalysis. I paid $149 to pee in a cup of which the VA will not reimburse.\nWell done and well said Mr. Secretary!\n34 years I been waiting on just one ounce of truth behind how I was Deserted in Desert Storm and how the Government has destroyed records and the time is coming to answer to the International Humanitarian and War Crimes major violations. I am an American Fighting Machine I will never give up on Justice or my innocence because I’m an American soldier and veteran. Put your seat belt on Mr. Collins. Because the final battle may come on your watch\nCan you explain how laying off probationary workers and offering buyouts to our underpaid healthcare providers is eliminating waste?\nWe need more people, not less. Instead of letting some kids who aren’t old enough to rent a car screw around with your systems, maybe hire some actual veterans to audit the system who give a shit. You do not have our consent to be doing this and it will come back to haunt you.\nBelieve it when I see it. The president is a lier and has always hated veterans. He avoided service. The idea of privatization of the VA is just a money grab by private insurance companies and private health care. They will deny care and keep our money. The VA isn’t perfect but works leave it alone. Many are happy with it.\nThank you, Doug. My husband is going through the process right now, and we received a phone call just yesterday, and our case is moving forward. Looks like the Democrats are spending every penny they have embezzled on trolls again. The only time I have ever seen attacks like this was after a pro-Trump post in 2017 when they targeted Trump. Just remember that liberals do not like losing power, and they have lost it all. Their following is only about 15% of the population, but their voices are always loud. We are winning. Keep moving forward as fast as you possibly can. All the right people are united in this administration. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show the world how wrong the liberals have been. Power and money are all they care about. I’m sure Elon is going to find a great deal of fraud and abuse. That money is for the veterans, and I trust this administration and you to put the funds right back into the veterans’ needs. God bless this administration, and God bless you, Doug. Thank you for stepping up.\nOUTSTANDING reply, Laura!!!\nThe VA does EVERYTHING in Slow Motion. From needing to see a Doctor (several weeks) to getting prescriptions (2 to 3 weeks) New glasses (6 to 8 weeks). God forbid I should get really sick! Someone needs to light a fire under under the VA!\nUs Vets have already shown we are willing to put everything on the line. Now the Rich want to cut our benefits? Lets find out. Glad to know my post will flag me for DOGE or some authoritarian response.\nI received a letter from VA a few days ago telling me that I was over payed in my benefits. The number is quite very high. They didn’t give any time frame of the over payment. I’ve been receiving service connect payments since 1993. What the heck, why did it take this long and why didn’t they give me more indepth information on the matter. All that was said is I owe money and my entitlements will be garnished. Sounds pretty lame to me. Now I have to pony up for a lawyer because VA just can’t get their act together.\nA VA debt waiver is a decision to forgive or cancel a debt owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). You can request a waiver if you can demonstrate financial hardship or that repayment would be unfair.\nTo request a waiver:\nComplete and sign VA Form 5655, the Financial Status Report\nWrite a letter on a separate sheet of paper explaining why you should be granted a waiver\nInclude supporting documentation, such as proof of income, assets, and expenses\nSpecify “Waiver” in Block “3” of the Financial Status Report\nInclude your file number and name on each page of documentation\nWhen to request a waiver\nYou have one year from the date you received your first debt letter or copay bill to request a waiver.\nFactors that may help your case: Low income, High essential expenses, Unexpected financial burdens, Inability to pay, and VA errors or misinformation.\nAdditional information\nYou can call the VA Debt Management Center at (800) 827-0648 for questions about benefit overpayments.\nThis is just a complete lie. There is no sense in which arbitrary firings can possibly lead to improved care.\nThere is also absolutely NO plan to *redirect* funds to VETERANS. The only “beneficiaries” you’re talking about are the rich paying less in taxes.\nShame on you. Shame.\nAre you a draft dodger too, Bryan?\nWe hear this all the time; however, the VA has been broken for a long time. I’m not holding my breath. The VA policy is delay, delay. and aways tell you what they can’t do never what you can do . As long as you have clinics like the one in Bismarck ND There are many others, but this one has to be the worst-case of incompetence. Talk is cheap, let’s see if we see any actions. I won’t hold my breath.\nYou will justifiably suffer if you believe you will be told the truth by anyone who has been given position and power under the Musk/Trump administration.\nDoug Collins DID NOT ANSWER the question about Musk&Minions having access to PRIVATE/PERSONAL information as with Medical information–An outright HIPAA Violation!!!! I DID NOT “release” my records to DOGE! Did you???\nThere is NO transparency and/or accountability amongst the lawless incompetents and robber barons accessing veteran/private citizen information via the Department of Veterans Affairs or any other government agency that tRump has opened to a billionaire TechBro that knows he’s buddied up to the perfect ‘mark’ giving him access to Data Mine the entire US Government. INFORMATION is POWER.\nNo doubt this DOGE activity will emerge as the largest (sanctioned) THEFT OF PERSONAL DATA of every Vet/US citizen (for misuse and monetization) in the history of the world. There will be ZERO recourse as all the avenues of reporting and enforcement are simultaneously being dismantled and/or lead by and stocked with tRump/MAGA castrati at the top and lots of sheep in the ranks.\nDoug Collins, Musk and Trump are liars and time (very soon in fact) will tell. The bad thing is our vets will have to pay the price when they have already paid so much to defend this country. Why treat them like they don’t matter.\nDan, your wrong. These people are known liars with intentions to lower the disabled veteran population to reduce the expenses of DVA. Less disabled veterans. My issue is the rest of the republican’s siding tor lies, injustice against the American ways. They are not the Superman’s except in their dreams.\nIt will be 2 decades before republicans can be trusted again.\nI admired Reagan and the Bushes, especially with the concept of “War against terrorism”. These were trusted Republicans. Now they are humbled, by Dictator Putin. What republican now believes Putin did not start the war?\nDoug Collins, prove us wrong and get the current president to promise VA disability, Social Security, and VA health care will not be lessoned like when he wanted to reduce social security to the 100% IU’s on a $ for $ ratio, to pay for his wall. Get the president to promise he will not treat disabled veterans like he did with the Honorable Senator John McCain, the last republican I could trust..\nMake that promise yourself. Promise to follow the Constitution over Trump.\nSorry Dan for the statement that you where wrong. You are right that the vets will pay.\nFWIW Mr Collins, most of us MIL vets don’t believe you have any power – Trump & Musk tell you what to do and you do it or get fired. They have demonstrated this thousands of times in the past month.\nAnd worse yet for us and what’s left of the VA you occupy office space at, this article was posted by Wired . com just 2 days ago – “DOGE’s USDS Purge Included the Guy Who Keeps Veterans’ Data Safe Online.”\nI’m a Disabled Veteran & I suppose when I posted the last time it got moderated…..but all of us Veterans need to think about all of the Employees @ DVA & thier Families that got walking papers and will not have a paycheck next month…..Really Sad for all involved…. Be Blessed\nMr. Collins…I very much liked your plain and to the point INTRO to believe! As DIS VET myself, it took me 11 years to convince the VA that a documented service connected disability was warranted coupled with my effort to have been massively complicated by attempting to do so via normal mail from an overseas location! I would like to see the VA promoting solid guidelines to the federal managers/selecting officials in the federal employment arena to consider job appointments for jobs applicable to qualified and certified 50% +, disabled VETs!!! Veteran preference is an absolute optional in my subjective opinion…as a Master’s degree holder, re-instatable federal candidate, TS security holder with 25 years+ experience, I quit applying for federal jobs after my 40th attempt!\nSome pretty harsh comments here. Gotta give Secretary Collins credit for not blocking them. But then maybe he didn’t see them, being busy as he must be talking up DOGE and Trump’s accomplishments so far, which can’t be impressive, considering they’ve only had a month to make a mess of things. Personally, I thought VA care improved a lot in the last couple of years, at least it did down here in the Texas coastal bend. Seems not all clinics and hospitals are run equally well. Mr. Secretary, I am sure you are a nice guy and want to give Vets the best care you can, but here’s the rub, your boss doesn’t seem to care much for Vets. Will he stay out of your hair?\nWhy would I believe this lying POS any more than I would believe bone spurs. The draft dodger said he will cut benefits in the V A, Social Security, and Medicare and he is doing it one by one with the help of that illegal immigrant musk. It’s just a matter of time. VA employees are being fired all over the country. They aren’t cutting fat, they’re cutting out the heart and soul of the V A and the country.\nThe “real truth” is my retired Army husband has oxygen tubes follow him around the house and is so disabled he never leaves the house. To get his 40% disability re-evaluated for an increase to 100% or at least 70% would require a 3 hour trip each way to Winston-Salem even though we are only 40 minutes from the Durham VAMC. He can’t even leave the house but a long trip is required. Retired Army were promised health care for life.\nThe last time we went to Durham VAMC he had to wait in the car for ten minutes because they ran out of wheelchairs. Civilian doctors say he needs a motorized wheelchair and home health care, but the home health care company needs orders from his VA physician and say his doctor doesn’t respond. I’ve called many times trying to get his physician to put in the orders. They say they relay messages but they never respond. It’s obviously due to cutbacks and poor organization since the last election.\nMr. Collin’s, you should be wearing a diaper on your chin for all the shit you are talking. They are cutting Veteran Employees who served in the military. If that is not a cut to the hard working veterans that served. You sir are just another Trump and Musk disappointment.\nAs a disabled Viet Nam war veteran, I have found the VA to be very good for all of the needs my condition requires. After discussions with the American Legion rep I found that many of the problems vets are having getting the care they need comes from failure to follow the rules in applying for and keeping up with the requirements of the VA. The other problem I see in all of these comments are the failures of the writers to show respect by making demands on others when they have not complied with the requirements properly. If you are confused or think it is too difficult, then contact your Legion rep and ask for assistance. Also, anyone who thinks that denigrating and disrespecting our President will help them, they are mistaken. Ask the Desert Storm vet who rode home on Trump’s plane whether they think he is not a good person.\nOUTSTANDING reply, Don!! There sure are a whole bunch of brainwashed, Communist CRYBABIES on here for the past couple of days, aren’t there??! I find it very hard to believe that most of them ever truly served our Republic in the United States military. If they really did, they sure aren’t displaying the characteristics one would expect from Warrior veterans!!\nNo cuts to VA staff or benefits? Unbelievable that our own Secretary is trying to have us believe this nonsense.\nI live in the Worcester, Mass. VA service area and was unable to see my Primary Care Physician on the two occasions I called for an appointment in the past 4 weeks. When I finally was able to reach someone in authority at the Worcester VA, that person explained that Worcester was experiencing sever Staff shortages and appointments for urgent care were being redirected to the ER’s in the area as well as commercial Urgent Care facilities. Ever try to get chronic disease related care at your neighborhood Urgent Care facility of ER? If you are near death due toa coronary issue or perhaps a stroke they are pretty good…but honestly they don’t really care about RSV or Sinusitis…both of which were misdiagnosed while I suffered with both for 4 weeks until I finally found a specialist through Community Care and was treated with antibiotics..cleared the sinusitis in two days. No reductions in VA care for Veterans? Nonsense…and shameful.\nSounds reassuring, seeing is believing.\nIt doesn’t matter where you go, you can’t escape chronic TDS. And frankly I’m beyond sick & tired of those more ons. It’s only the bottom of the first inning yet they’re already predicting the game is lost. Go away, PLEASE.\nI am glad to have seen the time come when veterans that have served this country get the care and benefits that they deserve and have been promised for years. The VA system is broken and needs restructure. Put administrators and department heads on a fixed salary that is appropriate to their skills, and expertise. Do away with the bonus system of saving money for the VA. Remember the VA is supposed to serve the veteran. It should not be about administrators and department heads withholding services and medical supplies to the veteran in the name of saving money and getting a bonus for themselves.\nDoctors and practitioner’s need not be sitting at their desk looking at the clock when the veteran is their to be treated. If additional medical staff needs to be hired, hire them. Spend some of that money that normally goes in the pockets of administrators and department heads in the name of boniness’s, in the name of money saved and cost reduction\nMake the system of filing for disability more efficient and in a timely manner instead of just “rubber stamping” denied to his or hers claim hoping that they will get discouraged and go away. Or even just die.\nOne other item that is important to me and most veterans i am acquainted with, is the prescribed drug program. If the veteran needs a particular drug made by a particular pharmaceutical company, prescribe that drug to him or her. Don’t prescribe a lesser quality drug instead. Which I have experienced personally. And address the issue of having the veteran pay for drugs, or even a portion of the cost. Remember the veteran has written a check to the Government that has no expiration date or amount on it. Giving his or her life for this country. What I have stated here are situations I have personally experienced and true to my knowledge.\nSo I would ask that the new head of the Veterans Administration, being a veteran himself, take these comments by this veteran into his consideration.\nYeah, no, the DOGE team shouldn’t have access to anything. To lie and claim they do not have access to the health records is laughable. They have access to our records. Also, they made sure the VA is an unsafe environment for LGBTQ veterans.\nGod bless you Sir, and God bless President Trump too. Clean it up please. Too many of my brothers and sisters have been waiting far too long for adequate physical rehabilition and/or adequate medical care. The disability review and decision process needs to be examined for more efficiency no doubt as well. Thank you Sir.\nLying puppet of the administration. Get bent, tool!\nThere is a reason he releases videos through youtube, and that is to circumvent actual reporters who might call out his blatant lying.\nI am sorry but when they fire the people that are in charge of our nuclear weapons and struggle to find them to hire them back is not a media problem. It doesn’t take a genius to know that if you are firing thousands in days you are not putting much thought in what you are doing. When you are telling people they are being fired for performance issues and your supervisor is telling you that is not why you are being fired. It creates a problem. There has been no time for performance issues to be evaluated on thousands of people. It’s not what DOGE is doing, it’s how. You people at the top will never get it. Thanks for trying to quell our fears but I am not feeling quelled.\nI see mostly sour grapes coming from what i believe to be disgruntled democrats. As far as I am concerned the VA is a god send for myself and vets who can still think for themselves and not be one of the bleating sheep who drank the joe and kalama kool aid\nAnything will be an improvement. My 95 year old mom has been waiting to see if she can get Aid and Attendance in Virginia since last March. Supposedly you expedite claims for those over 85 yrs old., if this is the fast track, lord help those younger. I guess you are hoping she will die first.\nHi, Betty. Thanks for commenting.

Now, I see\nall the comments…And I “KNOW!” of many, many veterans who VOTED FOR TRUMP. I said, this guy, with his\nrecord and his philandering….his treatment of General MILLY, his treatment of General H.R. McMaster (A roommate\nof my son at West Point)…\nNow you’re pissed off……I had a four year AF Airman First Class….who wanted all the Mexican kick out….He who\nworked with many Latinos…Voted for Trump!!\nSO YOU VETERANS…WHO WORE THE MAGA TO THE VA FOR TREATMENT!! Now suck it down……….\nCan’t cut what they don’t give. Veterans are not taken care of\nI do not DOGE anywhere near any of my information in the VA database. Doge is not House or Senate appointed or established entity and Elon Musk is not an elected official with legal rights and responsibilities for any of the actions he has been undertaking.\nIrene A. Abels, CDR, USNR, Ret\ni would rather you be focused on HELPING the veterans. not pushing your own numbers….\nIts why i am continually failing to recieve proper treatment, with BLOOD IN MY STOOL, and BLOOD IN THROW UP. Yet its not worthy enough to help a 100% disabled vet\nno…. no…… Cases. cases. cases. number number number\nMark my words……………….. I will die from this illness from lack of treatment, and then my autopsy and written testament will be plastered all across the country\nHi, Jared. If you’re having a medical emergency, please call 911. Please know that we’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nSay what you like, trump does not care what you think. Its going to take Congress to stop these cuts they are all to spineless to do their jobs but even if they took trump to the Supreme Court we all already know what the Supreme Court thinks too.\nThis is Trump’s agenda for the VA…\nTo revamp the Department of Veterans of Affairs with proposals to increase privatization, narrow the eligibility criteria for health benefits and replace civil service-style employees with political appointees in its ranks. – he basically wants to make money off denying care. Kinda like united health (whose CEO was recently gunned down) And to turn the VA into an extension of MAGA.. as in hire January 6er’s instead of career civil servants..\nThank you for looking out for veterans and their families and caregivers. I have been taking care of my 100% disabled vet since 1999. In 2000 he had a major stroke. During the next 20 plus years, hip replacements, open heart surgery and now suffering from dementia, parkinsonism, diabetes. I gave up my retirement money to help raise our children and in down payment for our home. He volunteered at an adult day care where he was placed to recover from the stroke until the last few years. The only retirement I have is Social Security and a small one from Wells Fargo. I just learned of the caregiver program about a year ago where I was able to get the stipend. My husband collapsed in our living room last December–heart failure–he is now in a nursing home (not a very nice one–none want to contract with the VA cause they do not pay enough). I now have to make a 40 mile trip (one way) to visit him. 3rd UTI and hospitalization since being there. Wehn he passes away, his disability pay from the VA and SS will be taken away along with the stipend. I will then have to apply for survivor benefit–which is not even half of his disability pay. In addition, last March he was diagnosed with arterial dementia and the VA supplied a wheelchair and walker. I knew I would be responsible for hauling him to appointments etc….and my 2006 vehicle was too small–so I purchased a 2020 vehicle that had more room. Now I am left with not even half the income and car and house payment (yes we purchased a different home as stairs in our split entry were too hard for him–so we got a rambler). I wish they would eliminate the survivor benefit for those married to vets long term and just let them at least keep the disability pay–sort of a retirement plan for caregivers. I hope you will consider this. It has been a difficult road for us.\nThe VA has been good to me. I have a good doctor from India. A concrete truck hit me from behind and I got surgery to correct a hernia. I fell 19 feet and cracked ribs and had a collapsed lung…the VA paid for the hospital and treatments. I would have been 5 figures in debt to the hospital if I didn’t have VA benefit. I consider myself lucky, most people have to pay horrendous amounts of money on insurance, and for the many things their insurance company refused to cover. I did complain when I first got into the VA because it takes so long for appointments, but I changed my tune when the VA stepped up to cover my emergencies.\nThank you, I think we all need to hear the real truth and not rumors. The main sream media likes to spead rumors just to get everybody all worked up. Again thank you and the VA to taking care of us Veterans. And I would like to send a BIG THANK YOU out to all those employees that are taking care of us, they are always courteous and caring to us.\nI and many others appreciate the efforts of ALL within the VA that strive to assist veterans. Thank you to ALL within the VA doing so much to help us in many ways!!!\nI don’t trust anything you say.\nComing from the state that you used to represent, I find you to be a very partisan politician.\nAs VA Secretary, I was hoping to hear something out of your mouth that didn’t sound like we are stupid and not smart enough to research facts. Instead we got a political soundbite.\nTime will tell what happens to us all.\nThe doctors at the VA Medical Center in Birmingham, AL said that they are worried – they’re hearing that VA Centers are going to be closed and many doctors and nurses are going to lose their jobs. Also, I have confidence that President Trump will keep his promise. The Biden admin gave VA money allotted them by the federal gov’t to Mayorkas to use for illegals. Our SS money has also been used for illegals. If people are given checks because DOGE has found fraud and abuse, then please give the same to our veterans. Social Security was in a private trust acct until Pres. Johnson used it for the Vietnam War – it continues to be in the general fund and is being used for anything they want. It’s so amazing how the Biden admin ignored any laws they didn’t like and broke them. Also, those who are slamming Pres. Trump for not being in the military – neither was Obama or Kamala Harris. I didn’t hear anyone saying anything negative about them – at all. President Trump will make this country operate as it should – he’s a business man who knows exactly how things should be done – fraud and abuse of taxpayer money isn’t going to fly with him.\nSo far I have been shown NO reason to believe we vets will not be targeted. Especially the disabled. There are changes that really need to be made. Start with Congress and their leadership abilities, moral and financial. I expect this will be be deleted.\nTo those pushing the “Leave a comment” conspiracy theories…the majority of negative comments are real and heartfelt. Veterans and retirees have always felt as if they were battling to obtain healthcare, especially for service connected conditions. They support system has perpetually lagged behind our nation’s desire for a capable and forward deployed military. It is not the general fault of an existing or prior administration. However, and with emphasis, there has never been an internal assault on our military operations and support systems as we have witnessed in the past couple months. I wont delve into the detrimental effects on other Federal entities…but they are all connected. VA healthcare is being negatively impacted, and political mouthpiece gaslighting cannot allay our concerns.\nYou get what you vote for…just dont complain about it after the fact.\nPlease add dental care to the Care in the Community program. Delta Dental insurance costs over $53.00 per month and offers only partial coverage for fillings, crowns and bridges. The VA does not offer dental care except for rare service related problems. I know veterans that avoid social interactions because of the poor quality of their teeth. Thanks.\nYou wrote: “Secty. Collins said. ‘In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.'”\n“He went on to emphasize that the Veterans Benefits Administration is clearing cases faster than ever and that VA remains mission-focused by doing what it is supposed to do.”\nGood, but not good enough. At a regional VA medical center town hall this week too many veterans complained of delay and inaction on their cases. My personal experience is PACT Act claims procedures need improvement. This was affirmed in Congress with proposed legislation last session to additionally resource VA claims processing but it was not fully voted on. There are too many processing errors due faulty procedures and rework is 3x as costly as getting it right the first time. Clearing a case is not a measure of success when the final disposition is incorrect.\nThat’s great thanks. But I think it is somewhat over-kill. There are a lot of problems and I am not happy with the VA, so many things I won’t even get into here.\nMy biggest concern though is and has been Why I have zero Dental coverage.\nThe other issues will work themselves out in the coming years.\nThank You\nAnd President Donald J Trump\nGod Bless\nI just don’t believe him. The 20 somethings with no military background will cut as they see fit and whether on purpose or accidentally benefits/services will be reduced. Will sooner rather than later. It will come like a thief in the night but be assured it will happen. If they can fire leadership, cutting services will occur. When your benefits are delay remember his comments.\nI have been at the VA 3 times since the election everyone is positive and looking for bigger and better. Doug Collin’s has been the head of the VA for what three weeks and he has communicated to the Veteran twice . I can’t even tell you who led prior … I have been involved with the VA since I got out of the Army in 1971…. I have good stories and HORROR stories … So let’s look for success\nYou talk the talk, NOW WALK THE WALK\nCome on my fellow VETERANS, how about giving the new SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS the opportunity to prove what he has said. Before you get on my case, I was drafted on Jan 17,1966 and sent to South Vietnam on Dec. 1, 1966.\nWhile there I went hospital twice. First time had a hernia the size of an ostrich egg. Second time,malaria two other tropical deseases, worms, and my temp hit 104.9 degrees. The only thing I currently qualify for is PTSD @70%.\nI also meet those other listed requirements, but have been denied compensation for them.\nThe VA DOESN’T DO THE INITIAL EXAMINATION OF CLAIMS ,THEY USE DOCTORS GROUPED UNDER THE VETERANS EVALUATION SERVICES! A doctor in Maryland decided that I didn’t meet the VA ‘s standards! I LIVE IN LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY , I HAD NO INTERACTION WITH SAID DOCTOR!\nNot Sure I can believe this. The present administration is fire-bombing most federal offices with major firings and layoffs across the board, including at least 1,000 in the Veteran’s Administration. I contacted my local VA Medial Center’s administrative office to ask about buyouts affecting staffing levels in the VA healthcare system and was told that, while buyouts were offered, medical staff was exempt and could not take advantage of the buyout. Still not sure how support staff, administrative staffing, etc. would be affected. The person I talked to said that there were still questions, particularly about any future actions. I guess we will have to wait and see what the future of VA medical care will look like. As a Vietnam Vet on disability, I am very concerned and this Rah, Rah speech didn’t do much to ease my mind.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them [Musk’s DOGE team] to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans, …”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General. Those folks know what to look for, honed by years of collective experience in the organization. Your existing VA OIG team, not some group of uncleared people unfamiliar with the internal and, often, legally required processes of the VA, are the BEST to continue their diligence in finding better ways to carry on the VA mission. They are your most valuable resources for improving the VA and investigating and uncovering fraud and corrupt practices; that is what you are looking for. Further, your statement “…find things we need to get rid of…” speaks volumes about someone with little experience in the processes and practices involved. The key to gaining efficiency and effectiveness is not to “get rid of” but to find ways to IMPROVE the quality and the processes that help achieve the mission. As long as your “partners” try to trash a system they don’t understand, there can never be acceptable change for the better. You must realize that the people you call partners, including the president, do not have the best interests of Veterans in mind – he has already called us “suckers” and “losers.” You better get this straight: we are neither. We have defended our nation against threats like this before and will again. We are Veterans, and we Vote.\nThank you!!\nI have a tough time understanding all the comments regarding mistreatment by the VA. I am USAF Veteran in the upper Midwest, I have nothing but good to say about the treatment I have received. It’s either me or just there are different VA’s out there. I am more than please with the VA. Thank you…keep it up!\nThanks Doug\nVETERNS NEED HELP WITH VA AND COMPENSATION- VETERN GOES TO IRAQ 2004-2005 ATTACHED TO 1ST ID QUARTER CALVES AT FOB MACKENZIE COMES HOME HAS A WIDOW MAKER AT 47 ANOTHER HEART ATTACK A MAJOR STROKE A SEIZURE BUT THE VA CAN NOT HELP HIM VA CAN NOT LINK ALL THIS TOGETHER. VETERN HAS NOT WORKED OVER A YEAR BECAUSE HIS CONDITION BURN PIT OINLY GETS 10% A JOKE EXPLAIN TO THIS VETERN WHY NO HELP VA SERVICE OFFICER WITH CLAIMS QUOTE THE BS RULES AN REGULATIONS VA SAYS NOT SERVICE CONNECTED VETERN NATIONAL GUARD FILES FOR PTSD VA CLAIMS TOLD HIM HE WAS NATIONAL GUARD DID NOT QUALFI FOR PTSD WHY\nThis is the classic Republican response when they want to cut spending:\n“We need fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. ”\nAnd yet, it is Republican run government programs where fraud, waste and abuse exist!\nFor instance, Republican supporters on this forum claim that fraud, waste and abuse exist evidently in the VA!! So OK you folks, can you point out anything you have seen or found in the VA system that is fraudulent, waste or abuse? I want facts baby and not your assumptions! My VAMC is great and takes care of all of my health problems. Hardly if ever had any problems with their servicing me! It seems that every Republican administration-Congress always tries ways to cut spending from the VA! Any anytime budget considerations come up VA funding-wise, they find excuses to vote against them. In reality, the VA medical system would not exist if not for Democrats!\nAnd please don’t give me this all liberals are communist bull! With Trump basically in bed with Putin, Xi and Kim Un, you know how he says he has love affairs with them, well–face it–they are all real communists. And anyone here who supports Putin and Russia (really still the Soviet Union) is in fact a communist or a communist sympathizer! And right now, its Republicans who fall into the communist category! It is the Republican party that does not want free and fair elections and supports a wanna be autocratic dictator in Trump! Trump has always said he wants to rule like Putin, and he sure as heck is trying really hard to do so!\n“We need fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. ” Hmm.\nI would like to see the exact cases made for each fired VA member accuse of “any fraud, waste, and abuse”. These employees need to be given the facts rather than the opinion of DOGE or the president. Did they provide specific incidences or just told them you loss because we suspect you of “any fraud, waste, and abuse”. Where is the Due Process within the Constitution that Trump himself applied to himself?\nThe Fraud part is at the top, with the person who got the due process and was guilty of Fraud. It is his second nature. To commit fraud is to lie. Therefore, Trump is a proven liar, and he will lie about his lie, like the Big Lie he did not lost to Biden.\nDoug Collins, prove Daft-Dodger Trump is not a liar. Prove to us that you served in the military and actually care for the disabled veterans. It is on you. If you do not respond here, then you show your lack of respect for people who served in the military., and people will not trust you.\nYeah? And trump said Medicaid wouldn’t be touched hours before endorsing a house plan to gut medicaid.\nI sure hope you’re willing to fight for this nation’s veterans Mr. Collins.\nHopefully, but time will tell. For those concerned with their information… really? Come on, your on the Internet answering this message and more than likely on social media, your information has been bought and sold long before DOGE had anything to do with it. The Patriot Act guaranteed that. Google and Meta are the ones you need to be concerned with.\nThe malpractice this administration is going to commit and the expense of veterans do to extreme incompetence and narcissism is going to be devastating and you, sir, are complicit and will be held accountable.\nWas this message put out before or after they decided to cut 1000 employees at the VA Administration..?? The date is the same.\nI, for one, am so glad that Doug is at the helm. Right man for the job, in my books.\nMr. Collins, please take a moment and actually listen to the people that are doing the job in C&P and see how it can be improved. There is still a backlog, these workers just got off mandatory overtime due to reduced backlog. Now with the firing/buyout there is a known fear that they will experience another backlog. Because whom is going to do the jobs of those people you let go? Then when those persons that are left to cover their work and those who left, and fall behind, then they are in fear of getting put on PIP and losing their job! The PTSD/Anxiety associated with helping veterans as a many are veterans of not knowing if you are getting a letter for firing, is unfair to those whom serve to serve others. THE BACKLOG IS NOT CAUGHT UP, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE AND THEY SAID THAT IS NOT THE CASE. Someone is fudging numbers!\nPlease listen to those persons who are doing the job, not the GS 14s and up, heck too many of them!!! if 19, 20 years olds can work for DOGE, clearly you can listen to the GS 12s and below. Heck, I have a few names to improve the processing!\nWhile you are at it, can we get 2 increases a year, or 5% will truly assist us!! TOO MANY Chiefs at the VA and that is a fact jack!! too many petty managers that will fire hard workers because NOW they can for their own personal agendas.\nNo one should be allowed to touch veterans benefits or to privatize the VA hospital. It’s quite alarming that the two people who wants to cut our benefits never served in the military.\nDon’t believe you.\nI won’t file a claim because of the Hassel I have to go through, I’m a Vietnam Vet and desert shield Veteran, Please cut all the red tape.\nIf there are ANY interruptions to my benefits, Doug Collins, I will hold you personally responsible. There will be no explanation that will satisfy. Cooperation with DOGE is all the proof I need to know who to blame. And I think I speak for many Veterans when I say, “The only thing I have left to lose is my benefits.”\nI’m excited that the President and Mr Collins are working together. I believe what Mr Collins stated. We have enough negative comments coming from the Democrats and the fake Media. They lie with no shame. President Trump is the best President in my lifetime and I served under President Nixon. Great things are going to happen in President Trumps watch.\nSecretary Collins,\nWith all due respect the VA needs to decentralize it’s VA Hospital management. Directors should be free to make whatever changes they feel need to be made without having to check with their boss who has to check with his boss. As a 20+ year volunteer and patient I have witnessed first hands this absurdity. Let managers manage and if they cannot, counsel, retrain and if necessary fire.\nPLEASE REMOVE THE PHRASE BELOW FROM THE HIRING PROCESS. This statement is embedded into every Veteran’s healthcare job posting.\nPursuant to VHA Directive 1193.01, VHA health care personnel (HCP) are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 subject to such accommodations as required by law (i.e., medical, religious or pregnancy). VHA HCPs do not include remote workers who only infrequently enter VHA locations. If selected, you will be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and submit documentation of proof of vaccination before your start date. The agency will provide additional information regarding what information or documentation will be needed and how you can request a legally required accommodation from this requirement using the reasonable accommodation process.\nAnnouncement #: CBTA-12690744-25-MTS\nThank you.\ni am a vietnam veteran and very happy to see the changes being directed to more services for our veterans 58,000 of my brothers sacrificed on that battle field they deserve the benefits they have for us it has been a long fight but it was woth it for the soldier who tookhis life at the trump tower was sending a clear message we need more or better services my prayers and thoughts go his family\nOkay, Please ‘listen’ to his statement. “Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut.” Maybe; but where they are going to slice and dice the VA, is reduction in VSRs, ratings staff for compensation, medical staff, hospitals and clinics. DOGE is looking for the “waste” in gov’t contracts, e.g., assistance with transportation, cuts or elimination of travel pay, costs shares will skyrocket up for medical needs, and we will pay for it out of OUR own pockets.\nMr. Secretary,\nI aske for proof VA appointment would not take longer to make. You did not respond.\nI asked you to guarantee VA and Social Security would not be lost on a dollar for dollar ratio as Pres. Trump attempted in his last term. You did not respond.\nI asked you to ask the president to promise VA health care, disability and social Security would not be negatively affected. You did not respond.\nI asked you to respond to all comments listed here on this page. You did not respond to my comment, did you respond to others?\nI asked you to not affect to retribution for these complaints on this site. You did not respond to me.\nI can only believe everyone comments will be used to lower all health care and disabilities from veteran complainers on this site. You collected our names.\nAs the president wanted to publish the name of anyone involved with the Jan 6 investigations, are you collecting name for retribution?\nPlease respond to each complaint and suggestion listed here. Assure VA will not be affected and the disabled veterans here will not be negatively affected. Ask the president to promise us. Until then, faith in you is not real. The news uses facts (except Fox uses hearsays). The president and staff uses innuendoes and hearsay, with lies.\nBe not one of these and protect disabled veterans and assure us what you are doing is authentic. Get the president to promise us. You promise us. You respond to all complaints positively. Or faith in you is not real.\nThere are 1679 comments on this site at the time of this comment. None show a response from you. Are you listening or is this a waste of time to you? I can only expect the worse since you wont truly assure us disabled veterans.\nNo response from Doug Collins yet.\nFirst, Mr. Collins, Secretary of Veterans Affairs. YOU ARE AWESOM, Thank you for taking on this responsibility, and We notice alreay a HUGE difference in Improvement since President Trump took office, and with you there.\nI’m also a consultant, and noticed a Lot of waste with paper being used and sent with Prescriptions. Rather than sending us Lots of paper that adds to the weight of postage, how about allowing us to just go onlinie since that info is already there.\nYou sound like a political hack!!!\nHow is cutting the VA workforce going to help us vets? The answer is IT IS NOT!\nLess people doing more work does not equal better care!\nDo your actual job – Serving us Vets & not Trump or DOGE.\nAre you trying to reassure us or go on a rant about the “media”? Very unprofessional and NOT reassuring.\nThey have a lot of political propagandalists in this forum. They only believe what they hear from others. The hackers only want to find out who is draining the coffers,If you are one then, you have a reason to bitch. If not then all the years in the military should have weaned you from the political tit and shit show. Its always been a SNAFU and until they let someone get it right it will be the same. The demo/socialists destroyed, piledged and stole from the US coffers and person that dont need your money are trying to fix it. Most of the persons on the cabinet are ex patriots or rich enough to not get paid for their service. Why the hell would they do that for US? I dont feel its a gainful reason to eliminate waste from a government that taxes the shit out of you, no matter how much money you make.\nI’m reading a lot of complaining, as usual. So let me say this. For YEARS, I have received VERY GOOD overall healthcare from my local VA. It’s much better care than civilian insurance plans that I’ve had in the past. ALL personnel have been nothing but pleasant and helpful during all of my visits. Thank you, VA.\nHaving endured pay delays and other suffering due to political budget shenanigans, it is hard to believe that DOGE led by an unelected official with no public accountability interference in VA management will benefit veterans. For decades Republicans and their wealthy supports have sought to privatize or deregulate government affairs to the detriment of the military, veterans, and the public.\nIts an awesome team that the greatest president of the US history has put together to gitter done. I really hope its not just another fight between political opposition.\nWas at the CBOC in Cottonwood,AZ and the picture of our President Trump was not up either, I see this may be happening across the country.\nI have told all of my Veterans that the Pact Act had no money behind it, as anyone that met the requirements the VA gave 0 % which means no compensation but they would take care of you medically. That is all it was good for.\nI have been a volunteer Accredited Claims Agent/ VSO for over 20 years. the biggest problem I think will save funds and a few trees is in the mailing. When I become a POA for a Veteran, I file the documents and when there is a decision or letter that needs to go to the Veteran, It is also in his electronic file that the Claims Agent can see in VBMS system. BUT, the VA sends a letter to the Veteran and to the VSO/Claims Agent/ Attorney who ever the POA is. This is not necessary as the VSO has it in front of them on the computer. Thousands and thousands if not millions of these secondary letters are sent for no reason.\nMaybe this will save a lot of funds and the eqrth.\nYOU CAN NOT BE CARING FOR VETS IF YOU LET A BONE SPUR COMMANDER IN CHEIF AND HIS hERMAN gOERIENG PARTNER RUN THE AXE OVER YOU YOU NEED TO STAND UP FOR VETERANS AS THEY ARENOT. OR ARE YOU IN LINE WITH HIS GOALS TO PUNISH US TO PAY FOR HIS TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH????\nThanks for the RIGHT information.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General.

Thank you Kent\n“clearing cases quicker then ever” yeah by denying them! waited 5 years for my cancer claim to be denied!\nglad i was hit with DU, got cancer and having the VA at least pay for my treatments….\nI am not sure I believe you. We have heard too many times that this won’t happen or that won’t happen in other areas and then jobs are cut. I also know President Trump has always wanted to privatize services, including Veterans Health Services. One stop shopping and home and community-based services streamline veterans’ health services by consolidating them into one facility. You and President Trump should pay a visit to the Veterans Administration and Hospital in Kansas City, MO. It is efficient, wait times to get services and in to see medical providers are optimum, we are treated with respect, always thanked for our services, and get good mental health and physical care. Contractors and sub-contractors are currently providing jobs to over 100 workers to build an annex to move all the administrative staff from downtown KC to the new location upon its completion. The VA has already seen cuts and there has been a hiring freeze for six years. Veterans cannot afford to have to go to various doctors and specialists in the community as many cannot, or do not drive and Medicare premiums would be costly.\nWho is to find “things we need to get rid of”? I feel certain that it is not a Veteran and if they are do they get their care through VA? I doubt it on both counts. How about you do something radical and ask those who go to the VA for what is and is not helpful. Do not just chose by cost and money, the way the current crew works, it’s all about money, ande them having it, not those who need it. May our democracy, country and VA survive.\nYea, right, after 40,000 lies from dump you want me to believe that a man appointed by a draft dodging traitor is looking out for my best interest. Bullshit.\nWhy is it taking so long to get disabilities evaluated?\nThe gulf war veterans need the VA Secretary Collins help in our quest. 2-21-2025 2;40 pm\nWhen you deal with bad PLs that do not change, it takes a good staff around the Sec of VA to show executive options. Not rely on Congress to do all the work. The Sec literally has similar powers as a President. So, CFR 38 ss 3.317 does not service connect because of the UDX aspect they could fix that. Gulf war is tied to closely to Undiagnosed Illness, VA countered this by making everything diagnosed even if its wrong.\nSo, it fails at 93% rejection rate which VA loves. All wars should be service connected by time, date, and location. Which they have begun to do with OIF / OEF under the PACT act. Only to find the PACT act exclusionary to 1991 Gulf War vets. it sometimes can literally be the title of the section of CFR 38 that hinders a rating and the ICD codes. Something I tried to fix on a VA federal advisory committee that VA blew off. I did the l same with the PACT act in 2021 when I said in the news media it had loopholes, and by September came the flood of zero ratings. The best most can do is 30% between gulf war and OIF, OEF – zero rating is often the end result. Its not fair.\nThe gulf war veterans need an open-door policy to act on our serious health issues.\nThe Whitehouse hotline and the VA-IG system doesn’t work unless Secretary Collins fixes the complaints system.\nA fast food chain and the health care system for veterans have absolutely 0 in common. It is insulting that the people that choose to care for us as veterans medically are now without jobs, ways to support their families and themselves. As us veterans individually, has any of the actions taken in the last 31 days helped any of us. Ask us. Because when you ask us, you will receive a truthful answer of you are making our healthcare worse, not better. Also a large demographic of employees that you improperly and unjustly fired, are Veterans themselves. You make no sense. You don’t care about us veterans. You make short videos saying nothing. You answer no questions. Show data. Show documentation. Your words mean nothing. Where is the proof to back up your false claims? Where are the receipts? Down right disrespectful. A spit in all of the faces of veterans. Shame on you.\nYea, like we are supposed teo believe you. Retired back in 2008, and still fighting to get benefits that I earned. Why am I having to fight for it? I met all the qualifications for the pact act, had Lymphoma, been to the places listed, and still got denied. PACT act is a crock of lies that the dems made to make it look like they care for veterans when the fact is they don’t, nor do the republicans. Have back issues that I have had ever since I retired, and well, because I never went on sick call for back problems, they didn’t service connect it. Guess it was nice of my back to wait til the week after I retired to start having issues. And those commenting well it takes time, yea I know it takes some time, but, how is it when they send you correspondence, they give you a week to have the proof sent to them or all the sudden they can give you a decision in a short amount of time.\nDear Hank: If you look back you will see that it has always been the Republicans at the White House always hinting at cutting our benefits and Social Security for the elderly. Trump and Elon are Republicans. Also, you might want to try a different avenue of applying for your benefits. I went through a VSO after being denied, while other went through other agencies that try to help veterans get what they deserve without a fee. Some even got lawyers. If you ever complained about your back to a fellow soldier or if they witness an event that probably caused the problem, you can get witness statement from them stating what they saw or heard. Good luck and don’t give up.\nHank, why are you blaming the current admin?? get help resubmitting you request!\nGary\nWhen I was having troubles like yours I went to the American legion. They will help fill out the paperwork and send it to the proper persons. They also have personnel embedded in the va to hurry the process along. Give them a shot they have come through for me several times\nI know that is hard, but it there is a reason I always told me Soldiers, no matter what, go to sick call. I can’t blame the VA for their choice when in fact there is no documents in your records. My bother had the same issue with his knee, never got it looked at, and the VA said nope. Your best bet, is to get letters from people you served with that can contest to your back issues.\nThat’s your problem. To get benefits, your problems HAVE to be service-connected.\nWell let’s see if this comment gets totally censored out like my first two. Under the guise of moderation.\nRetired in 93, finally got a 10% rating last fall. Now I get a small check monthly, oh, but same amount is taken out of my retirement, so potentially I get to maybe save on taxes. Over the years I have known many others who did get disability, strangely, none were retirees, another significant %, well if I comment it would be falsely attacked as lifestyle prejudiced.\nPACT seemed a no brainer. After all my initial claims except 1 were denied, further checking revealed all the denials were done without any medical records, no recognition of RVN service. i had to even get and file copies of all my DD214’s and they still got my periods of service wrong.\nPlease, some improvement definitely needed.\nI would love to believe your comments, but looking at the current administrations ability to speak out of both sides of their mouth, and past/current actions I want to see it before I believe it.\nLet’s talk about cuts or better yet severing an established service connection due to glaring VA errors. Service connection for my sinus cancer was granted and then summarily severed due to the VA erroneously asking provider after provider for an opinion for “skin” cancer rather than my sinus cancer. DBQ Derm does not allow for a positive opinion on a sinus or any other respiratory cancer and as a result my service connection was severed then eventually restored after one provider pushed back stating she could not provide her opinion for a sinus cancer on a DBQ Derm however even though I have clawed my way back to even 100% now I am still waiting for the VA to recognize that my dental issues due to radiation damage that I claimed in October of 2020 are service connected. Cutting out the errors that result in such awful decisions will go a long way to providing better care for all veterans\nIn plain English, does this mean that DOGE has access to my personal health records? If so, I demand access to all the members of DOGE personal records and even Trumpy. They can’t have it both ways.\nI want to know as well. What information are you, Doug, giving them?\nI want to see President Trumps picture hanging on the wall at my VA center in Mobile, Al. It is unacceptable that it’s not up yet. They said they ordered the pictures jan 22,2025… Why?? He was nominated President Nov. 5th. No accuses. I am very upset. Please make that happen yesterday. Thank you\nI’m sure you are looking for his recently released “Long Live the King” photo… We took an oath to the constitution , not some jerk who thinks he can be a king.\nI’ll vote for that.\nDefinitely, should have been waiting in the wings.\nBro, Please re-read your statement. a) it took about two months before Biden’s photo went up. b) “He”, was nominated in July (or August), and elected (won) the presidency on Nov 5. Your putz is getting his face all over the VA soon… sadly.\nThat’s your big concern? Laughable.\nI was at my local VA Office this week. It was a relief not to see his disgusting picture there.\nYou are among the dumbest people on the planet. You are triggered but silly stuff and spend your time online crying about nonsense. Grow up and read a book someday?\nYou Go Mike!!! Let Us know when that happens…\n“No accuses” people are worried about their benefits, they are worried that the government is not holding up their end of the bargain.. and you are upset about King Trumpy’s portrait?\nI totally agree with you\nIs that going to make him more of a president than he already is. Get over it.\nHis picture is hanging in the bathroom.\nYou wont have to worry about anyone’s picture in any office. President musk is closing down all the V A offices in the country. You’re lucky that’s your biggest problem. Most of us have more important shit to worry about.\nIn theory that all sounds great. But based on what is currently happening across the Federal government, I have major concerns.\nFellow veterans, read up on the Bonus Army. (https://department.va.gov/history/100-objects/object-21-bonus-army/)\nTrump and his cronies do not support us, and will do all they can to destroy our military. Here’s what he just did to our top military leadership: https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-fires-the-chairman-of-the-joint-chiefs-fd4a4d07\nStand up and speak out against Trump’s attempt to destroy democracy, Americans.\nYou and Trump are NOT to be believed…you are just one of his sycophant lapdogs who will do ONLY what is directly approved by Trump, his number one Lapdog-e Musk. Trump and Musk will cut our services and those in the VA who provide it. You will only respond by regurgitating whatever talking points provided to you.\nAsk Donnie T. how goes his famous heel spur that his daddy used to keep him away from military service. After all, according to Donnie T.’s own words that we–those who served are “suckers” and “losers”.\nNOTE Also: Musk is a native South African and immigrant who would not know the first thing about military service, where country comes before self.\nSpread your hate elsewhere! New admin takes time to sort out the mistakes of the previous administration!\nGary\nUSN Ret\nYour ignorance is absolutely breathtaking.\nI have set and read many of the comments and I think it’s hilarious that many of the comments are about having access to your private information. There is no way that you can so naive as to think you have any private information. All private information went away with the invention of the computer and the internet. probably 85% of you use your cell phone for transactions pertaining to money or with all of the little apps installed i.e. Tick Tock which pulls every bit of information off of your phone and sends it to China. the United States is constantly participating in conflict somewhere weather it’s on the news or not. I’m not saying it’s a perfect system but the Politicians that we have and continue to vote into office have done absolutely nothing for more than 50 years while becoming multi-Millionaires on a little more than average salary which the receive for life as well as medical benefits. so, for those complaining about Trumps administration after a month, Go call you Representative (if they’re not out in the street whining and singing like first graders) and ask them why they haven’t worked on this stuff. I spent almost 23 yrs in and have been through 19 surgeries, so I have earned the right to call you out.\nAt the risk of getting on a MAGA-DOGE future revenge list, as a disabled veteran I have to say that this disgusted me. It was purely partisan political apologetics. The “media up here” that he dismisses is doing its job of the Fourth Estate being a watchdog on government actions, and that’s why he has to be defensive. His boss doesn’t care about veterans, having repeatedly and publicly made it clear that he thinks service people who are maimed or killed or POW are suckers and chumps. And this guy should be fired for letting Musk and his DOGE minions into our data: I gave the VA permission to maintain my health care information for its use, I didn’t give it permission to reveal it to an unelected band of idiot thugs to mine. Maybe we were chumps to serve instead of paying quack doctors to certify “bone spurs.”\nMan you really need an attetude check. This news is all old false unfactual garbage.\nThe media were often proved right. While most media are probably biased, so are … who? Trump? DOGE? Absolutely! Cost cutting eliminates potential wasted spending on “loser” POWs and war-injured veterans. (quoting Trump). Sadly, we may all suffer in the end. I heard required follow-ups for suicidal veterans are delayed, sometimes by weeks or months. I’m sure there is waste potential everywhere, but let’s not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Trimming waste is hard work and takes time.\nI’m an army veteran ( peace time). I do have service connection for tinnitus and kidney cancer. Loma Linda VA saved my life. A doctor at Loma Linda said I was cancer-free. I sold my house. I moved to a new state. 6 months later I found out I had blood cancer through a biopsy from the El Paso VA. That was 3 years ago. Zero treatment for my cancer. Zero medication. All my pact act disability claims have been denied by someone in Waco Texas. I live in New Mexico. Oh yeah I’m a retired California state firefighter and EMT. Obviously these knuckleheads are retaliating against me, so I will never receive any of my VA benefits earned. I had to go out and pay for medical insurance just to get sleep medication. I have numerous medical issues and I will never even ask for help from the VA ever again. VA is junk. I recommend the leadership team and doctors and nurses be removed from the El Paso VA medical system indefinitely. The Las Cruces cboc ran by the El Paso VA Medical center is horrible. The nurses there call it the “Sh*t show!” El Paso VA medical system along with the Albuquerque VA medical system has it been a disservice to this veteran since December 2021. I will testify to this any day of the week.\nWritten by an army Cav Scout and retired Cal Fire firefighter and EMT.\nDid you think it’s the VA staff that gets bonuses for turn you down. Here in AL the head of VA disability service was fired a phew years ago because he received a bonuses for the longer wait time. Took 10yrs to get mine, it was in my medical record in black & white. Like you I went 1 1/2 years with cancer my first time before any thing was done. Now just yesterday was dx for my 4 round. Good luck\nHi, Jared. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWhy is this war hero a POW OF THE VA ADMINISTRATION?\nI know Mr. President Trump cares about very much, and is extremely busy cleaning up ( “finally” ) the mess. I’m hoping you free me so i don’t have to bother him.\nIt’s called being in “Lockstep”, to be in complete agreement or to conform with someone or something else; whether or not it is right or wrong. Did you hear how Virginia is going to financially assist those in their state who have been canned by Trump? It’s NOT the state, rather, it’s TAXPAYERS who are going to have to swallow this! That is, THOSE WHO STILL HAVE JOBS!\nMr Secretary, how do veterans, veteran families and caregivers contact you directly with their concerns? I read the OMB new director Vought’s plans for veterans disabilities. Now I can not steep at night over the worry. Vought is no friend to veterans. I would like to believe you sir , but I am not letting my guard down..\nI don’t believe you, nor do i believe Trump. What i do believe is that you will do whatever it takes to deliver tax cuts for the rich and cut wherever you can to get the funds for those tax cuts.\nSorry you feel that way. As a fellow veteran, you are intitled to feel any way you want. But as Secretary Doug Collins stated, the reality is what actaully happens, not what folks may think or feel.\nDoug Collins knows what he is doing and knows how to do the job of making the VA as lean and efficient as it can be. However, no one is “entitled” to receive something for nothing or take advantage of funds just because they have been allocated. I hope you have a blessed day.\nUgggghhh. …so SORRY to read your comments… hopefully Trump will acquiesce(sp?)/be hands-off. He certainly has many other great achievements/100x’s better than “let’s GO Brandon” as a President.\nThanks for clearing that up. Hurray!!!\n“However, no one is “entitled” to receive something for nothing or take advantage of funds just because they have been allocated. ”\nThis applies to Trump and Musk and the rest of the 1% way more than to ANY veterans receiving benefits or federal employess or other hard working middle class Americans. I hope that what is stated here by Sec Collins is true and that veterans retain their benefits and support from the VA, but it’s hard to ignore what is happening every day and the stories I’m hearing from friends, federal workers and VA nurses being fired without cause. The disruption in people’s lives by all this is real and not positive for them or their families. Why should we believe that we’ll be safe when others are not?\nSorry you feel that way. As a fellow veteran, you are entitled to feel any way you want. Secretary Collins, lied, because DOGE does have access to the medical records. He doesn’t know what he is doing because he has never ran an organization, let alone a government one. Last time we heard the words “Lean and efficient” a lot of veterans lost access to care. I guess you support that kind of thing though. Also, NO ONE IS TAKING advantaged of any funds that were allocated by CONGRESS. Love your gaslighting.\nFred,\nYou’ve been duped, pal. (Unless you’re lying on purpose. ?♂️)”Probationary” doesn’t mean “new”. A lot of skilled career employees – veterans included – are being summarily canned because the incoming regime wants to assert dictatorial power and give tax cuts to the rich. It’s not to benefit us, and there’s not even any way it *could*.\nTrump just called himself king! Wake up already. If you still hold to the Constitution we all swore to defend, then there is no excuse for you to be repeating this nonsense. The truth is out there, and the proof is a search query away.\nI appreciate the change from the new Secretary and look forward to the new concern for Vets. I am a vet, 80 years old and the only benefit I have used was when I bought my first home in 1973, I am fortunate.\nThey are looking to get rid of Medicaid funding. So, all vets with certain conditions living in elderly homes will not have the ability to pay and stay. A daughter of a vet suffering from alzheimer, whose home costs $16,000 a month, is scared for her dad. Medicaid pays 1/4 of the bill every month, and they can’t afford to take up the cost. There is no new concern for Vets. If you cut employees, all VA interactions will take longer.\n“I only used my benefits to purchase a home when they costed 10k, shame on other vets who need services. Only for me but not for thee”\nI completely agree, that is what his first term was all about, tax cuts for the rich. I wish some people would read ACTUAL news and NOT just your right wing echo chamber where you hear what putin wants you to. When will they realize ALL cult leaders are evil?\nWe are all just frogs in a pot now. Some of us can can feel how bad the situation is getting, and some of us will deny to the end that there’s anything wrong with Trump’s moves to consolidate power and remove all checks on that power. Putin’s Russia is his model, and we are heading that direction quickly. Surface level freedoms to preserve the charade is all we’ll be left with while the billionaires loot everything else.\nLike what Mr. Collins had to say, and I liked the way he said it. Direct and to the point in language you could understand. Not a lot of blah, blah, blah and say nothing.\nYes, very direct, but was it the truth?\nI Love it.\nSir,\nI’m attaching a picture of a woke hallway in St. Cloud VA\nDon’t know what woke is do you?\nWhat is “woke”? You explain that to me…is it so called ‘woke” because you don’t agree, or is it because something just might be true! I am a veteran just like everyone on this chat, I’ve this before just like many of you have but I guess depending on what side of the aisle you sit on will determine how you comment. Every chat always begins with the issues then it turns into a political blame game, or who is oh so great. Politicians are all about “self”, and people are perfectly fine with things that happen or don’t happen until it affects them, then it’s the other parties fault…aren’t you tired?\nAccording to the US Office of Personnel Management, military veterans made up about 30% of federal employees in 2021, and many of them had service-related disabilities.\nThis entire administration is complicit in mass firings of veterans. They don’t respect us. They don’t care for us. They don’t work for us.\nAll of you who believe they do and support them are guilty.\nIm sorry that many of you think this is twitter. One line commentary.\nYour going to turn VA off, and they want this. To make this location\nthe scape goat to shut down future channels.\nSome folks caught on and wrote there public letters to the Sec of VA.\nThat this is a public soap box. Others think a ugly or vulgar one liners\nis all that is needed. Those are the ones going to get us call cut off.\nDont blow your only chance to be heard other than knee jerk reactions and\nspew pointless remarks. There isnt anything else left and VA wants to\nshut this down too. So they claim people are rude, and so they can go\non ignoring us. Already trying this at the other sec post location.\nIf you have nothing, stand by some of these other people who wrote\nparagraphs of interesting materials. Show them some support. Reply to\nthem and show some form of unity.\nUnity on something, anything. All of you agreeing on one idea would\nchange everything. Not even a person, just the idea. Areas that could\nchange if you all said it together.\nCan go on 1 thousand one liners, or all of you saying one common idea\nat a time till VA deals with it. Vote as a group. Take charge. Get past the\npersonality part, focus on content. Something simple, super easy. Like\nopen door policy so you can be heard.\nVA wants to say it lost control here, dont let them. Its already showing at\nthe VA Secretary Doug Collins addresses Veterans benefits rumors in latest\nvideo. VA wants this quiet again, no problems. Silent hallways.\nRealize what is happening here. Censorship is already raising its ugly head.\nYeah…and our social security is safe too…President Musk will take his chain saw to all the benefits of Americans paying taxes, while the Manchurian Candidate Trump serves as the puppet!\nHistory has proven ithat if lies are told often enough, they become truth. SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS!\nThis guy is lying to us.\nHe’s not to be trusted. Now he’s also looking at ways to privatize our care – in the false interest of “efficiency” – when in reality it’s all about shifting the money to private insurance where we know care-denials are rampant and 21% is siphoned directly off of the top for overhead,\nFor a guy who has been on the job about a week, I hope he really knows what he’s talking about. There is a lot at stake here: I’m in the process of qualifying for a lung transplant. My condition is slowly worsening and ANY interruption in services will put me at risk for the rest of my life, bothe pre- and post-operation. There are lots of reasons for being incredulous, especially since my sources aren’t just the media. We’re forced to ride this rollercoaster to the end and I really pray that everything works out well.\nAnd we all pray with ya brother at arms.\nThere is very little chance that your hopes will be met by this man. However, there is still plenty of room to resist.\nFor one, you can educate yourself and others on the nature of “probationary” status in federal service. These aren’t necessarily “new” employees, and these cuts are NOT targeted to any reasonable notion of “efficiency” or “improved care”.\nYou can also contact Congressional representatives, or even attend a protest (health permitting). Let’s not throw in the towel just yet.\nI would like to know if you are a veteran ?\nIn theory that all sounds great. But based on what is currently happening across the Federal government, I have major concerns.\nHere at the Milwaukee VA, programs are already being abolished without replacements and veterans with PTSD are getting LESS care. The art programs here that have helped a lot of veterans are being closed and deemed as unnecessary. It is very important for vets with PTSD to have more than talk and group therapy, we need to truly connect with our emotions and art, music, and recreational therapy does that and connects us with other veterans and the community. Changes that are taking away programs that veterans care about is actively happening.\nI don’t believe any trump appointee.\nNeither do I,\nI can only hope the words you say are true but I don’t trust any of you MAGA radicals, show me! The trend on the right is to put down true patriots and cut everything so the rich can have everything, stripping away things that benefit the rest of us. We are all for trimming excess and have our taxes spent wisely but the problem is in determining what is essential and not, and how it is done!\nWhat is this about cutting VA benefit payments. We laid down our lives for this Country, what more can we do. I’m 76 years old and cannot work anymore, I have service related problems that prevent me from sitting or standing for longer than about 20 to 30 minutes at a time.\nDelta Echo India – hire: Collins\nDonald subservient.\nExpendable.\nIncompetent.\nThere is too much hatred on this website. You folks if you have a real problem at your VA, then immediately ask for a patient advocacy to help you with your situation.\nIn his first term it was clearly documented Trump lied or made stuff up on the order of 30,000 times. Now his co-president seems to spout stuff clearly not true. You do their bidding. How can I possibly believe anything you say? This whole government just makes stuff up.\nMore than 55 years ago when I was in the Navy we had a verb, a transitive verb I should add, that meant to discard without thought and depending on context to discard with contempt. It was to shitcan. Neither of our co-presidents served or have a clue about what it means to serve and the one who would be king avoided service and has clearly demonstrated contempt for those of us who. When it is expedient or useful I fully expect you and they will shitcan us without hesitation. I will enter all my information below so you can target me for shitcanning.\nObama didn’t serve – he said that he thought about it, but it wasn’t for him. Kamala didn’t serve – she said nothing at all about it. So, I only hear people slamming President Trump because he wasn’t in the military. Biden et al and Kamala lied much more than 30,000 times – probably 300,000 times – as everything either said was a lie or some kind of unintelligible statement that made no sense at all. The Biden admin broke laws constantly because they felt that the Constitution and Bill of Rights have no placed in the government of America. All they wanted was to make sure the com mie doctrine was in place everywhere they could get it. During Trump’s first term, promises made/ promises kept. He has made this his pledge again. DOGE is making public all of their findings – transparency is taking place every day. Trump has done more in 1 month than Biden et al did in 4 years and all of it is good for the average person – DOGE is showing where all of our tax money is being spent – it sure isn’t being spent here in America. The list of items is unbelievable – there are many people in Congress who are getting kickbacks of money to add to their coffers, millions of $$$. Trump wants the budget balanced, just as in any business. It will happen under his administration. Promises made/ promises kept. The promise list is getting checked off quickly.\nGetting appt. Less than60 days\nJust because DOGE finds an item due to noticeable $Dollar signs does not mean the entire item needs to be scrapped. The slash and burn attitude of DOGE is reckless and irresponsible thereby not good for the Vets and their families. DOGE is having a negative effect on our population.\nSadky I agree with everything you write.\nUP to this timrI have always received excellent care from the VA.\nWhy sadly? Like you the va has only done well by me since the day i returned from nam. Kudos and thanks to the va. I will however say that since 1971 the va has gotten better as time went forward\nDOGE is only having a negative effect on the population who didn’t vote for Trump. He won the popular and electoral college vote. DOGE is NOT being irresponsible and they are not harming any veterans or their families. My husband and son are disabled veterans. During the Biden admin, my husband couldn’t get in to see his primary care doctor for over 2 years. His appointment was canceled every time. Now that Trump has taken over, my husband has seen his primary care physician twice and he will have a cardiac appointment for the first time in 3 years – all of those appts were also canceled. So, things are looking up for our family with President Trump at the helm. The last VA secretary, Denis McDonough, gave the money that was allotted to the VA for the veterans, to Mayorkas in order that he would have more money for the illegal aliens. Our social security money has also been going to illegals and they have been given free health care – Medicare and Medicaid – which American’s have to pay for – even Medicare. So, I think you better read something other than what you’ve been reading or watching on the news. You’re badly mistaken about Trump – he love his country and will do everything in his power to make America a wonderful place to live, again.\nThank you very much sir. We all know the news media likes to put out false information to confuse the Veteran’s who haven’t any way to see the real info put out by the VA unless they go to the VA for an appointment. My son works for you all and he was worried and I told that his job was safe.\nDEI hire.\nDonald subservient.\nExpendable.\nIncompetent.\nI have read some impending doom remarks. I am appalled by some of the things being stated. Those of you waiting on your money, that’s not new, that’s the military units not knowing what needs to be done. Paperwork for retirement must be done 6 months out from your MDR. Disability claims take time with processing. I’ve been through it and if you don’t get the right physician and the verbiage isn’t correct it takes longer for them to adjudicate your case. All this again is based on the assigned people with individual cases. Remember you are not the only person applying for both retirement or disability. Since it’s only been one month as of today, please be patient with changes that are yet to come. The VA didn’t get this way overnight, so Secretary Collins is working hard to correct the negligence from years of not caring about the veterans. Keep positive and keep pushing for Veterans Rights.\nI agree. Been waiting 18 years but can still walk, talk and have all limbs. I can wait a little while longer. Cervical and Lumbar spinal replacement. Let those with better reasons to go first.\nAgree Peggy. I am a disabled veteran who fought the VA and won. My case was a lot of work on my part, the VA will not help and no one knows my case better than I do, so I treated it like a job . President Trump runs his mouth a lot so is misquoted a lot, that’s just who he is. He is NOT a politician, thank God for that. He has never disrespected us, and he will cut disability to veterans. DOGE has nothing to gain by looking into individual medial claims, that is not its mission. BUT to look into the VA itself, oh yes lots of DI there. Go to the main hospital and see groups of 2 or3 employees standing around chatting with each other. Obama did that–“created” jobs by splitting the job of one making it two.\nNo. While it’s true that this is a poor choice of forum for benefits issues, it’s not entirely irrelvant here. We already suffer obscene wait times and disturbingly careless denials of claims. “Probationary” does not mean “new employee”. It also includes anyone who recently received a merit promotion.\nThere’s no patience to give here, and asking it is harmful and insulting. These acts are not the march of positive progress. If the VA was actually overstaffed, that argument might have some play. But there’s simply no sense in which that is true. They are directly attacking on our benefits, in an underhanded and possibly illegal way.\nThere’s no honor or decency in the behavior of Trump or his loyal sycophants. Please stop spreading disinformation.\nI also was in Vietnam from January 1968 to February 1969. I was also exposed to Agent Orange. When I returned, the only help was to get a house or a loan to go to school. There was no medical help. I had a host of problems and didn’t know what to do, so I became a heavy drinker. Luckily I married a woman who refused to give up on me.\nMr. Collins, I’m copying a fellow vet’s comment. Heartfelt.(You know I do not know why I even wrote a comment. NO BODY reads these anyway. Videos and mailings are just lip service !!!!! They honestly think veterans are just too stupid to know any better. It is so aggravating dealing with the VA. It always has been)\nSincerely Vincent A.Velasquez\nMr Secretary Collins\nThank you for standing up for our Veterans. I believe with your expertise and willingness to do the right thing will allow our Veterans a sense of honor and dignity. I would be willing to help in anyway I can here in Arkansas. I feel with my 35 years of military expertise\nI can be of assistance in the VA system. Thank you for your time. Respectfully,\nMAJ Penny Smith (Retired)\nWhat expertise would that be? He has no medical training.\nThank you for your service, I think some people here are just mad because they lost the election. Give the man a chance, then comment. Lashing out without merit is just petty.\nThis is Bull S—T, our VA System is loaded with too many top level managers, out dated web site, not easy to navigate and slow in following up on care. I’m 86 , 87 this and it appears to me ., that gthey drag my needs out and make me do cartwheels and the deny, it appears that they can’t wait till I expire ? so they don’t have to deal with me. Our commander in chief just froze VA workings and when you go in the Drs Nurses and workers are not smiling any more. NUFF said, Anchors Away, Hooraa, Semoer Fi.\ni do not know how any veteran could vote for this coward. my family has a total of 68 years in the army. we are not suckers or losers.\nPlease do not take the President’s comments out of context. If you are going to post a snippet, then post the whole conversation. Otherwise, you open yourself up to a defamation and slander lawsuit. Our family goes back to Revolutionary War days. Take care my friend, thanks for your service, and have a Great weekend.\nIn context, he called service members suckers and losers and he has denigrated US on more than one occasion. Furthermore, his disgraceful actions have led to friction between our allies and the USA, caused the deaths of countless members of both the military and special agents out in the field, and has sowed hate and distrust within our own population, all while kowtowing to the most oppressive regimes on the planet.\nAnd lets not even start with what happened on January 6th, 2021, when he called on his supporters to attack the capitol in one of the most brazen insurrections in US history, while allowing for his own vice-president to face the gallows.\nThis man is not fit to be the president of the United States, is an active participant in the destruction of our government, and a puppet for foreign powers that enjoy seeing the chaos Trump is sowing in the USA.\nHe isn’t taking it out of context, friend. When a man says “I don’t respect you veterans,” believe him.\nMy family was of the original Virginia planters, and no one has ever reneged on their military duty. Your “boyfriend” has received SIX deferments (heel spurs) for service in Vietnam, yet his orange ass is all over golf courses! And, remember how the CRETIN refused to honor our WWI vets during the 100th anniversary while in France because “it” didn’t want to get “its” hair wet in the rain! Here’s your threat to the previous post, you SNITCH! (Please do not take the President’s comments out of context. If you are going to post a snippet, then post the whole conversation Otherwise, you open yourself up to a defamation and slander lawsuit). Put my name on your list, you coward! You’re thinking like the Clown in your making threats to fellow veterans. Remember who always had your back!\nSo why not post the context then, if that’s your sticking point? Maybe because it doesn’t make it any better?\n“In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.”\nLove the gaslighting you done.\nyou are lying , Trump never said that….. it was even never proven, quit spitting out lies\nThen you better tab Obama and Kamala cowards also. Obama didn’t serve – he said he thought about it, but it wasn’t for him. Kamala – she didn’t have anything to say about serving in the military one way or the other. Walz – he lied about what he did in the military along with some other candidates who also lied about even being in the military. So, if you have nothing to say about the above people not serving, then don’t say anything about Trump not serving. Also, you have taken what he said out of context, like all good little com mies and the legacy media. All of you are NOT supporters of our President, you apparently voted for the opposition.\nThis is awesome news. Finally, sense making in the government. Slash waste, fraud and abuse, and focus the money on where it does the most good. As for Elon Musk and DOGE, if the paid for political hacks in the Washington swamp and career bureaucrats can’t stand getting an audit…that should tell you something.\nThere are three parts of Government. Executive, Judicial, and Legislative. The Executive branch is headed by the President as such he has the authority to open anything to anyone he wishes. This is the way any large business is run. To be effective he must delegate duties since he can’t do it alone. I have received a number of letters in the last few years about data breach’s regarding my personal information, so I am afraid my secrets are already out there to a lot less honest people then those working for DOGE. Do I agree with all the things going on in Washington? No, but I am sure that no matter the person running the place in the last few years the Executive has be run by various people in a fashion that has been shameful and needs an adjustment. Unfortunately going after new hires is the only way to do this until a system is established to weed out the deadwood in some of the offices.\nTime will tell but given President Trump’s well documented history of mockery and distain for America’s veterans coupled with his near total disregard for the qualifications, political courage, or character, of his appointees, it is difficult for this veteran to remain optimistic about the future of VA healthcare.\nWell said.\nSo, here is the thing, you survive the President….that is how it has been for the last 30 some years…we’ve never been given a good choice…so you survive the roller coaster ride, I am hoping that we will come out better on the other side. But, I will tell you that no matter what happens, the VA (and all of us veterans) will still be here. I mean, hello, how much have you overcome since getting out of the military? I was in during the Cold War era, and even as a female I was treated horrible by civilians (so that is my vote for NO PRIVATIZATION)…the civilian world is full of a bunch of greedy a-holes that we have to deal with on a daily basis, so if we need to cinch our belt for 4 years, figure it out. You were not given the tools you got while you were in the military service to wallow around like a civilian, so honey’s SUCK IT UP BUTTERCUP. WE WILL SURVIVE, we did not learn the skills we learned while we were in to just turn into a big baby….we ARE survivors and we WILL survive whatever this presidency throws at us…\nAnd not for anything, but I agree with what they are doing, not HOW they are doing it, should have started with a FULL AUDIT….but, the waste in our government (wouldn’t you like to be able to give yourself a raise??) is out of control. I do hope that the country continues to back its veterans, because FREEDOM is NEVER FREE. It is paid for by those of us who choose to raise their hands in defense of our country & Constitution (not the government). So, stay true to yourself and don’t just go with the flow. Find what you need to do to keep your future bright, because it is UP TO YOU…I am scared of what will happen, I only have the VA for medical, but I will survive no matter what happens, because I survived being Active Duty! If you survived Active Duty, you can totally survive THIS!!\nI trust Musk and Trump to do for us what Biden only lied about.\nTrump promised to abandon our allies and take away American freedoms. You voted for that.\nI have been a Republican all my voting life, all the way back to the Young Republicans for Nixon’s 2nd election.\nHowever, I will not vote republican as long as Trump and his lackeys are selling our country.\nI can’t believe you and others are allowing this to happen.\nYou had two chances to stop it the first time around and did not! I did not realize it at that time either, but that is no excuse for what is happening now. He is killing people, don’t you see that?\nPlease show me I can vote GOP again. So, STOP LYING, and empowering liars. You’re handing our country over to, well I don’t even know what to call them.\nPlease wake up and stop him!\nWhen will you honor your pledge,,,,\n“against all enemies, foreign and domestic”\nYou are full of S–t\nVeteran’s medical records & personal information privacy was not addressed.\nWould like a straight answer.\nIs DOGE having access t this information??\nHe just addressed it and stated they do not have any interest in our info, they want to make sure that any contracts that are in place to service us veterans, that money is actually spent on us. Please stop listening to people who haven’t a clue or just spreading misinformation. By the way the SSA and IRS have people in the same capacity as DOGE and they look at your information. Do you trust them not to divulge your information. Just relax.\nI trust them more than I trust a bunch of tech-bros and a billionaire with hundreds of billions of dollars in potential government contracts to decide how our taxes are spent. Musk wants SpaceX and Tesla embedded in government spending so he can get richer. He doesn’t care about you, and Trump will go along with everything he says. I can’t understand why people like you continue to ignore the blatantly obvious conflicts of interest this administration continues to inflict on our country. Did you buy Trump stock, or his rug pull meme coin too? How many times must you be scammed before you wake up?\nMy friends work for VA and are veterans, their data was breached by DOGE!\nThank you for your input on our concerns over our benefits that might be cut!?….\nSincerely,\nMrs. James R Cales\nThey will not be cut!\nOf course they will! It’s in Project 2025, and so far they have been following to a T. People said it was not the president’s agenda, yet everything being done right now is straight out of the Heritage Foundation agenda. The budget proposes to stop any funding of Medicaid. Any vet in an elderly home or on long term disability depends on Medicaid to cover costs of healthcare. Vets in memory care will be left forced out of their homes.\nGood initial message. Let me know if I can help.\nI can’t believe what little faith you have in president Trump and musk after what you had under Obama and Biden. Neither one loved our military and Doug Collins is a good guy. I’ve watched him for a while now and like him a lot. It’s been a month give them a chance. The other two presidents have tired to ruin our country. I know it’s a long process and it’s hard when you’re hurting. My husband was 25 years navy and never wanted to put in for his VA” he said others needed it more. But we finally got him to realize how many problems he has. We’ll see what happens. I love America and president Trump.\nFirstly, I’d like to thank all my fellow veterans for their service !!\nIf you don’t believe that there is fraud, waste, and abuse of your tax dollars then you are absolutely right not to support Trump and his designated representatives in DOGE. You can join in with the politicians who are fighting against the audits of organizations like USAID, but unlike those politicians, you won’t be making any money off of it. The entire process is going to take time and will require some sacrifice, but the ultimate goal is to improve the economy, shrink the deficit, and put more money back in the hands of the taxpayers instead of other countries and economies. Refusing to believe the promises made by the president are somewhat illogical as he has most definitely worked to keep so many promises that he made during his campaign in the past 30 days.\nIn the end it’s all up to you and, of course, this is only my humble opinion, but I choose to believe that the purpose of the cost cutting and auditing of our government offices will eventually help us all to be stronger financially and fiscally.\nI would never see a fellow veteran hurt, and do not believe that in the long run we will be. If you disagree then is your responsibility to get in contact with your elected representative and make your concerns known. If you do not do this writing something here will not help you at all. Let your voice be heard where it will help.\nWe are strong and we are many !!\nI’m the wife of a highly decorated US INFANTRY Corporal. we’re in our fifties. My MOM has TDS. I am a 3xTrump voter& hubby voted Trump/Vance in 2024 after YEARS of political apathy …WHY is my Mom(&many others) he’ll bent on saying that Trump will cut Veterans’ benefits/cut seniors’ medicare etc etc…\nI’m honestly confused. I live in “stoopid liberal Colorado(Yea gangs of Illegals!)” It really seemed as though things were better 2016-2020…\nPatience is a virtue. It took four years of tyranny to completely destroy the US economy and security, it will not be fixed in a month. I wish all would look at the way it was in 2016-2020, he did his best with a democratic/Socialistic Senate and House. He knows what needs to be done, and now he has the citizen, senate and house republicans majority backing him. Just got a few bad weeds to pluck to get the garden producing real produce.\nAll I know is my 87 year old father’s VA funded homemaker services are ending this week. The VA did not call him or notify him of this. They notified the health care company that they would no longer be paying for services as he no longer qualified. Nothing about his condition has recently changed. His housekeeper stated that about 10 of her client’s home care services were cut this week. She states she will need to look for another job. When the VA cuts benefits it effects many different people. My father is not able to care for himself. I will need to do more for him now. This will make it more difficult for me to work. Everything has gone up in price and I am no longer able to afford groceries most weeks. Now I will not be able to take extra hours at work. I am poor now and it appears things are only going to get worse for the working poor as prices on everything continue to increase. I don’t believe what this man is saying because I read the recommended report that called for drastic cuts to the VA. I also know that Trump has made very rude comments towards Veterans on more than a few occasions. He has never shown any respect for Veterans, and I doubt that will change. I am sad for our country today and just hope that the US does not abandon it’s Veterans. God save the USA\nHi, Melissa. We’re sorry to hear about your father’s experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWill the Manila VA get upgrades . Not only are there older vets here\nThere is a growing community of DS,OIF,andOEF vets coming to the Philippines. Plus many at the VAhere wish they could offer more services (non-admin)\nMr. Secretary could you please look into what I am about to tell you please sir. The VA is making veterans like me that got separation pay pay it back by taking our disability checks away from us to pay back the separation pay. This separation pay was given to me almost 30 years ago and they are taking my disability check away from me that I need and I know a lot of veterans had this happen to them also. This isn’t right. As a veteran we shouldn’t have to pay back any separation pay. That pay helped me transition from military life to civilian life. Veterans like me depend on our disability check to help us each month. Please look into this and please get this stopped not just for me but to all the veterans, Thank You\nA VA debt waiver is a decision to forgive or cancel a debt owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). You can request a waiver if you can demonstrate financial hardship or that repayment would be unfair.\nTo request a waiver:\nComplete and sign VA Form 5655, the Financial Status Report\nWrite a letter on a separate sheet of paper explaining why you should be granted a waiver\nInclude supporting documentation, such as proof of income, assets, and expenses\nSpecify “Waiver” in Block “3” of the Financial Status Report\nInclude your file number and name on each page of documentation\nWhen to request a waiver\nYou have one year from the date you received your first debt letter or copay bill to request a waiver.\nFactors that may help your case: Low income, High essential expenses, Unexpected financial burdens, Inability to pay, and VA errors or misinformation.\nAdditional information\nYou can call the VA Debt Management Center at (800) 827-0648 for questions about benefit overpayments.\nI’m concerned about African national has access to my information not only on VA.gov. but also social security. I request that my name and info be removed from what ever info he has.\nIf you ever used PayPal he has it already.\nIt seems to me that you have never been independent and always pushed right wing policies. Will that change in your new position?\nwhat absolute bullshit. Trump Doesn’t Give a Damn about Vets and Musk’s Team of Juvenile hackers are attacking agencies that were investigating Musk. Paying Vet’s their Benefits or providing healthcare Doesn’t Profit the Billionaires one bit, and so will fall under the category of ” wasteful spending”. Trump has already Violated the Constitution averaging about Once per day since he Entered office, why would he stop at those of us sworn to uphold and defend it?\nOh! It seemed as though doge is a good things. I certainly do NOT want one more illegal alien crossing the border. Poor Jocelyn Nungarye, Laken Riley and too many others DEAD at the hands of illegal criminal aliens. We’re home owners, live less than 5miles north of EDGE OF LOWRY….THIS CRAP must end…our children deserve much better\nThey’re not doing a single thing for the American people, except taking our money. The president should care about ALL of the people. Not just some. He refused to send disaster relief to CA because we have a democratic governor. He has sent not one cent. That’s disgusting, and I’m sick of it!\nI would assume that you know for certain that DOGE is doing good things as you call it? Although I am in no way advocating illegal crossing into the US, those “Aliens” as both the president and you call them are human just like you…oh wait, their not from here so that would make them aliens…I see now! Do better\nHow can you sit there and blatantly lie. We were at our VA today half of the staff are gone. No one to help take him to the 3rd floor . You are a disgrace . You do not support the veterans only yourself and orange.\nShort and to the point – Well Done. Looking forward to the ramp-up of even better VA Healthcare. Best wishes to you and your team.\nWell done President Trump appointing Doug as our Secretary. I have nothing but the highest praise for our all three departments of the VA. Specifically, the VA Health and the VA Benefits Administrations. Excellent health care since retiring in 1991.\nDoug, you know where the Left and Democrats get their information. It’s truly sad when veterans feel disenfranchised. I’ve always recommended fellow Vets visit one of the well-qualified Veteran Service Officers (VSO’s) at the various veteran organizations. I am a Life member of both the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). America has great veteran organizations that provide support and guidance. BZ to you and your team.\nThis is a weak scripted response, as a Nam era veteran having served this country it is a disgrace what Trump and Musk and his bunch of cronies are doing to our country and hard working Federal Workers. Actions speak louder than words Mr Collins.\nMy uncles BOTH served Viet Nam in the Marines. I am still not convinced that “Let’s Go Brandon” would’ve been better for our Vets&Seniors’…. MY HUBBY is a Ver(US INFANTRY CORPORAL 1988-91\nMy husband is a disabled veteran and receives very good care at the VA. With that being said I know that there is much wasteful spending within our government. I wish President Trump would drain the swamp and not go after the Department of Veterans Affairs employees who only make 60,000 a year.. go after the big guys who are cheating the system. Why are so many people in Congress millionaires?\nThat’s not what DOGE said they have laid off 1000 employees though it’s not a large amount we have been having trouble with appointment’s and reliable transportation to and from appointment’s. So I guess I’ll just have to wait and see if things get any better which I seriously doubt.\nEver run this past the attorneys, Doug. Is this use of government resources for politicking? Does this violate the Hatch act? Just askin’, ole buddy.\nI’m a disabled Army veteran of 32 years, and a bi-lateral amputee. I’m still waiting on my SMC case to be heard, and I definitely can’t afford to lose what I do receive from the VA now. Trump should be hands off on a lot of things, and the VA should be one, as well as the Pentagon.\nUgggghhh. …so SORRY to read your comments… hopefully Trump will acquiesce(sp?)/be hands-off. He certainly has many other great achievements/100x’s better than “let’s GO Brandon” as a President.\nHe has only achieved in destroying our democratic govt. It’s gonna take decades to pay off all of the lawsuits due to the illegal acts of Trump and Musk. You just can’t fire govt employees, especially those who have employment contracts, just because you want to.\nSubmit a congressional inquiry to your state’s congressman. This expedites your claim. If i remember correctly, from the time congress sends your inquiry over, the va has 72 hours to respond? I used to work in claims department and I myself have personally submitted a congressional inquiry and it did get addressed right away. *stuff they don’t tell you*\nThank you Sir.\nUnder no circumstance do my husband who is a US military veteran and myself support Trump and allowing Musk an unelected private civilian have access to any federal agency or make changes that can impact our well-being negatively. You, the VA, have the responsibility of protecting veterans their families and dependents from losing or reducing their monetary, health and mental healthcare, and other benefits. As it is the VA system is very dysfunctional and nearly impossible to navigate through, making unlawful and careless changes to the system makes it more difficult to almost impossible for veterans to access such a vital component for their well-being, especially the elderly, mentally incapacitated, and those with brain injuries sustained while serving to protect this nation.\n?? Veterans Deserve Better – Why Is the VA Ignoring Its Own Laws on Missing Service Records?\nThe VA is failing thousands of veterans by ignoring its own regulations regarding missing service treatment records! 38 CFR §§ 3.303, 3.304, and 3.307 require the VA to accept secondary evidence (lay statements, medical opinions, post-service treatment records) when service records are lost or destroyed. Yet, veterans are being denied benefits because of the VA’s own recordkeeping failures.\nThe VA Secretary has no power to say there will be no cuts. The Elon/Trump dictatorship will cut whatever they want, without regard for anything except their own pocketbooks. They will cut our benefits long all while adding to Elon’s billion $ government contracts. Don’t pretend like anyone in this administration is there to do anything other than make money for themselves.\nI got ripped off by the VA for 8500plus. All I got was a run around,not even a disabled tag for my truck.\nI am retired DoD employee, and a Vietnam Veteran that is 100% TDIU and I find it very hard to swallow that we have DOGE who is going around pulling people from jobs. The people that they’re targeting are those who are on Probation, and the government hire these people because of the downsize that they have had over the years. A person have to remember that when a person retire, they need to train another person for that job, and in most cases they’re hiring two for the one person, because of all the work a excuse my words (an old timer use to do). I know as a retiree I filled the work for two or three personnel at time, and now a new person have to come on board an learn the work by themselves without the aide of an old timer. Yes, a lot of stuff has gone internet or through google, but there’s lots to be said about book knowledge and not just Google knowledge. I hate the fact this administration is firing people without knowing the work that is being performed. As far as the Secretary saying what he’s saying, I to will hold you to your words. After all Congress passed a lot of others to their word, and now they’re going around chopping people from their jobs, just be of trump says so or this person name musk. The word must to mean only a bad odor, and this guy is a bad odor waiting to happen. You may not like my words and I don’t care, I’m a veteran and retired federal employee who did his country proud, and I’m honor to have served both. Now, treat your veterans right and hopefully in the future the Veteran Organizations that support the clowns we put in office, will keep their mouth shut and not support any politician and see if they can elected on their TRUE words. If anyone comes after my ss, accounts or any of family information, lookout.\nThis dude must think we’re all stupid. The mere fact that he used this snippet to attack the media tells you everything you need to know about him. Donnie D*mb *ss doesn’t give a damn about veterans. We’re props when he needs us for a photo op and we’re disposable when he doesn’t. Never forget these words spoken by Donnie….\nOn disabled veterans\n“Why do you bring people like that here?

In addition to the combat injuries, he is now being treated for leukemia which was most likely caused by exposure to toxins and other hazards in Afghanistan. Based on the PACT Act, he applied for a higher VA disability rating due to toxic exposure, but he has not yet received a response to his applications for over six months. Could you please expedite this slow process.\nLeukemia is a high priority claim. Those are USUALLY expedited. I’d get in touch with your vso or submit a congressional inquiry.\nI was denied benefits for secondary ed because of my advance prostate cancer. informed the va that, I tried penis pump, pills penis ejects still waiting to here back from them\nThanks to everyone for their concerns.

Hey, I felt it was time to retire because I was treated fairly. So, here’s my question; Will the government\nallow the full amount of SS allotted to those, like myself, the framed amount over the time we spent in Private Industry work without losing that money, for working under the States PERS scheduled money allotted? Thanks\nfor your reply. Mr. Keenan PS. Word has it that President Trump is going to pass it thru to follow the new guidelines of Social Security Monies and Government Work Monies. Thank you very much for your reply\nI don’t believe that Trump really cares about our Veterans we need to spend a lot of money to take care of them which is exactly what we need to do ? problems though are that doesn’t help the 1%\nI certainly do not and will not trust any sort of message from The Traitor’s Cabinet. DJT, the draft dogger, called veterans like us “loosers and suckers” and naturally will not stop President Musk from destroying the VA. The VA is extremely understaffed yet 1000 employees from the Crisis Line were summarily fired. Action must be taken to restore democracy in the US starting with Congress stopping the illegal actions by DOGE and the DOJ arresting Musk for his violations of US Law including his fraudulently obtaining US citizenship.\nI cant trust President Trump or Elon Musk to speak the truth when they don’t seem to care about the Ukrainian nation and more about what pleases Putin !!!\nHere here, trumpy has lost his mind.\nHe’s not interested in Ukraine because he has no financial interests there like he has in Russia. And I guess post WWII, the Iron Curtain, and spread of communizism have been conveniently forgotten. Let’s see, Ukraine is a sovereign nation. Crimea was part of it until Puti stole it in 2014. You don’t annex by force or coercion. Puti didn’t stop with Crimea…. will he stop at Berlin this time. Trump makes America great again after he makes Trump interests great again. Putin’s puppet.\nI’m pulling into your way as secretary of the veteran administration. I’ve been trying to get my disability for the last 56 years. Haven’t got anything.

IF YOU ARE NOT DISGUSTED BY THAT, THEN YOU ARE WORTHY OF THE POST YOUR IN!!!!!\nI hope things get better with clearing cases. I’ve been waiting since July 2024 just to add my dependent and there’s not been a single update to it on the web site since it was submitted. I’ve called several times to inquire about it, all they can tell me when I call is that’s it’s “pending.” Secondly, it took nearly a year for my disability claim to be processed and came back with only a partial rating. I’ve resubmitted additional information, it that going to take another year to get feedback on? Finally, I’ve been trying to get a community care referral for a procedure that is authorized by the VA, and if authorized for one Veteran, it should be available for every veteran. However, getting this referral is proving to be very difficult with multiple hoops to jump through and the providers at the VA hospital not being very helpful or being cynical at best.\nI just find it disappointing that illegal aliens, those on welfare or receiving other benefits seem to get signed up and receiving these benefits with little to no effort while Veterans have to run a gauntlet of numerous obstacles to “maybe’ get the benefit they have earned.\nI wish Secretary Collins much success in his new role and I’m hopeful he can make the highly needed improvements. Hey, how about reassigning those 87,000 positions authorized for the IRS to the VA instead?\nI do not trust Doug Collins nor any other Trump appointee. Elon Musk, an unelected billionaire, is taking a meat axe to our Federal Government, firing people with institutional knowledge and civil service protections, while Trump shreds the Constitution and the Rule of Law. We will be lucky to come out of these next years with our democracy intact. Quacks and incompetents are being installed to head cabinet positions. Real people are hurting as a result of Trump and Musk’s actions. More cuts are in the offing and no program is safe.\nTime will Tell !\nGlad to hear benefits earned will continue. Perhaps vets can finally receive the federal mileage reimbursement for medical appointments vs the .41 cents per mile and a deduction of $3 each way. Fifteen years ago, homecare nurses here got $.58 per mile. Wonder what VA employees get for their qualified mileage reimbursement.\nOoooorah! You said it, now stand by what you’ve said and do it! Semper Fi!\nI see when he was asked about DOGE getting access to Veterans personal information how he really didn’t answer that question just like the rest of them avoid answering a simple question.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, you need to resign effective immediately and should be banned from any position within the VA or any Federal position.\nThank you for your comment.\nThank you Secretary Collins! I am looking forward to your leadership with this Department. I really appreciate your transparency and your energy! As we say in the Navy….BRAVO ZULU!\nFiring thousands of employees… but healthcare won’t be affected? How dumb does he think we are? Has anyone else been at the VA and heard anyone talk about being over staffed?\nTypical trump boot licker trying to save face while he plans to stab us in the back later\nI’m a 77-year-old veteran (1968-1975, Honorable Discharge). I just watched the President of the United States with his [virtual] arm around Vladimir Putin, announcing to the world that Ukraine started the war that has devasted their homeland and killed thousands, followed by a rebuke by Vice President Vance of members of the European Union who had the audacity to suppress AfD’s assault on a demoratic society, and a clear move to abandon allies of 80 years for a war criminal. So perhaps you can excuse me for being skeptical of anything coming from this Administration. The G.I. Bill gave me a career after service, for which I am extremely grateful. It is devastating to see what has become of a once-proud nation.\nThank you for your service. I wish you well\nAction has a Reaction. Ukraine did start the war and Putin said “OK, let’s go”, and moved Armored vehicles into position. Biden got USA involved with dollars and the game was afoot.\nWatch your back veterans! He sounds like a Trump suck up. Remember that Trump dodged the Viet Nam war and has no respect for veterans!\nTrump did not dodge the VN conflict. Bone spurs are identified by X-RAY not by a letter from daddy who was a land developer not a government official with pull. Clinton dodged the war by fleeing the country.\nThere is a special place in hell for you and the others that bend the knee and kiss ring. Sacrificing veteran care to line your pockets. Utterly shameful. You are a disgrace and I hope both sides of your pillow are hot in hell.\nFull cowardice on display. They break us in their wars and then get upset when it costs money to keep us healthy. DOGE and trump will cripple the VA. Firing thousands of “probationary” employees to save a buck in the name of “efficiency”… what a disappointment and disgrace.\nI was out drinking… I just woke up… what’s going on? aslo… how did you get my email?\nMr. Secretary,\nI was not deceived by the rumor reports but appreciate you prompt reassurance.\nAlso I regret that the VA is subject to such false reporting.\nI don’t understand what ‘website’ is required to leave a simple comment,\nThank you for the straight dope on the situation. Much appreciated.\nThank you for your service to America’s Veterans !! Please keep up the Great Work !!\nVery disappointing message delivery and content. Hypocritical and disingenuous when thousands of VA employees have been axed by an administration that is doing immediate and lasting damage across all Federal agencies. As happened with the Bureau of Land Management 6 yrs ago, there is no concern for the impact, only moving in a manner that eliminates opposition and any effort to reduce costs responsibly.\nMr. Collins, your political invocations show you are as crass and uncaring about Veterans as the angry orange you serve. You do not serve nor honor my 20 years (and 3 family generations) of Navy service.\nPlease inspect the Tuskegee va\nI found Mr. Collins remarks about veteran benefits being cut or threatened as a standard “talking point” that is the answer for any DOGE complaint about acting as a legitimate branch of our government. Congress needs to stop allowing him and his team to have access to any records of any Federal employees. Don’t trust the media but trust Trump, Musk and you? Your actions speak contrary to your message. Will you resign your position if this continues or will you stand up to Trump and Musk?\nMy experience with the VA where I live has been A plus for 35 years. I have watched them deal with staff shortages, uncertainty with funding and now the threat of having their position eliminated without a valid reason. I appreciate everything they have done in the past and worry about how the future will look.\n50 years in the VA healthcare system since 1969 Vietnam I am in Shock and want to Scream\nMike R, that is straight left-wing conspiratorial fear-mongering garbage. You’ve trusted an incompetent federal government with your personal information your whole life, and didn’t think twice anytime they’ve asked you for your personal information. It’s utterly laughable that you think Trump and Elon are going to take your banking to steal your VA pension.\nI’ve been waiting 3 months for approval…To have a tooth fixed!!! The government has ALL our information already.\nYou either work for them, are 100% leftist, or NEVER had to deal with the VA.\nQuit bellyaching…Most of us want the VA FIXED.\nWalter Cook\nDo you honestly believe there is no waste that can be addressed? They need to go over all the contracts from govt. contractors go bankrupt without finishing a project. Salisbury NC VA. Contractor won a bid for a 3 story parking garage. Stopped at 2 levels because of structural problems. And most of the 2nd story is unusable because of those same problems. The contractor got paid $10 million and declared bankruptcy. The VA needs to stop paying for shoddy construction. And seeing how the democrats are the first ones to call for cutting DD funding. I am more worried about them. The standard talking points I’ve heard over the last40 plus years is everything is good. While waiting weeks or months for appointments. especially to see a specialist. No communication between VA hospitals or clinics. Ask about it being computer generated and was told they don’t talk to each other unless specifically asked. There can be improvement. If I believed the media rhetoric the world under Trump would have ended in 2016.\nSecretary Collins,\nI am going to hold you to this. I am in a 6x month estimated waiting period myself for backpay owed. I, also, 100% support DOGE. It needs to happen, and that much is obvious to me. I read a lot of scathing comments below that make me think there are simply bad actors who aren’t actually a part of this crowd within them, specially the ones that have nothing to do with the VA or your message since it appears that anyone can comment here. I can tell you that it has taken many years to get as far as I’ve gotten with the disability process. It shouldn’t take actual years for this. That’s ridiculous.\nDear Secretary,\nI hope your words are of truth: only time will tell. Please help the displaced federal workers that need help as well.\nRespectfully,\nChief Johnson\nIt won’t be understaffed if you privatize it\nNEVER PRIVATIZE. VA offers the best care. Average wait time in Civilian Hospitals for new patients, 26 days. I never wait that long. The VA offers community care if they can’t see you in a timely manner. Privatized Care will cost taxpayers (you and me) lots more money. The care givers are not specialists in war time injuries. This is a money grab scheme.\nGood idea! But I am 1-Hr+ away from any VA facility anyway.\nWhy not just cut the VA down to just those required to treat and work with serious war injuries and severe PTSD. For the rest of us, make it so we can go to the Dentist, Doctor, etc. without having to wait weeks or months for approval from “Community Care”. I have been waiting over 3 months to get my tooth fixed. THAT is RIDICULOUS!\nBut, yes, privatizing would be better than it is now.\nSincerely,\nWalter Cook\nTrump/ Musk, sounds like brown shirts to me.and all off his picks have drank the cool aid.\nI served three tours in the Nam with the USMC, was wounded twice ,suffered broken bones and am a diabetic from exposure to agent orange. I do not trust you or any of Trump/Musk appointees, none of you are qualified for the jobs you have. I firmly believe despite your statement that if Trump/Musk says slash and burn the VA you will be the first to light the match . I believe that the VA secretary should always be a COMBAT VETERAN!!!!!! How can we trust a president who buddies up with a Russian dictator????????\n100% Agent Orange Killed Us In Vietnam We Just Haven’t Died Yet Sprayed and Betrayed 1967\nI agree with you he sounds like a Trump suck up! Please remember this in the 2026 election when no Republican is standing up to Trump!\nIgnorance. Remember this, no Democrat stood for us. Or cancer kids,gold star moms ECT. Y’all are all about me me me me. Pogs\nTotally agree, he’s going to prove to be another spineless jellyfish making excuses for commander bone spurs, who dodged the draft.\nSince when did he buddy up with a Russian dictator you ate up POS.\nYou did not address the firing of 1,000 probationary employees, many of whom at Vets.\nDoug , STOP! We know from the video you are a Trump Boot Licker\nAnd we also know you’re a liberal. You are using hate and media propaganda instead of common sense. We have a $70 trillion debt. Mostly to China. $5.6 billion a day interest payments. A almost $2 trillion deficit. Now give me any examples of democrat cutting or even slowing of any spending. And I’ll give you one to start. They always throw the Dept of Defense out first for cuts. Guess where the money for the VA comes from. It’s all part of the DOD budget. But the democrats always say they would never cut VA spending. But like many it seems to be a case of don’t touch my govt benefits. Go after someone else. right. There are many Vietnam veterans who voted for the change. I’m one . The country is going broke. The left doesn’t care and spends taxpayer money on their agenda instead of the people who need it most. Homeless Vets and other citizens.\nI don’t believe that it’s only Liberals as you call them that use hate or media propaganda instead of common sense. Yes we do have a huge debt, many people act as if it juts happened in the last 4 years. Government spending has always gone both ways, when one party is in office, the said spending is just right, but the other party is in office they are wasting tax payers money. We have a tendency to make excuses for whoever we voted for so hat we can feel good about our choice…but always remember, common sense is not common to everyone!\nWhen will choice program come back. President Trump said he would privatize the VA, I can hardly wait.\nMe too, John. VA incompetence is stunning.\nThis is embarrassing, you’re just towing the maga republican line blaming the media for your parties inability to lead. You sound like a used care salesman. Your fast talking isn’t fooling anyone but the fools. Keep your politics out of our medical care.\nQuick question, tell how firing people is going to improve the speed of getting an appointment?! Get your head out of this administrations a$$, the military is apolitical and so should be the VA. You’re an embarrassment to the uniform.\nWe have to take to the streets\nFor what. If the democrats would agree to cuts for their pork barrel agendas like sending 50 million to house illegals in hotels in NYC or for DEI programs in other countries. Building a roads to nowhere. Maybe the deficit and $70 trillion in debt would be addressed and our benefits would be better. Instead of attacking the ones trying to fix the mismanagement of the country for the last 50 years.\nWhat about the reduction of disability benefits due to household income thresholds with reductions of disability payments to start at houshold incomes of 125k and a reduction to zero benefit dispursed at 175k. That was voted on and put in place that is supposed to take effect in April of 2025 , but keeps getting pushed out and delayed, please address this.\nTypical Trump dog. No substance with more BS. Agency under staffed but does best it can. Then it gets cut more. Doesn’t look like anyone has any balls. Your just another puppet.\nWhere has it been cut. 1000 probationary people out of 475 thousand. Nationwide. If it’s like the FAA firings it’s janitorial and lawn mowing people. $70 Trillion in debt to China. $3.6 interest on that debt daily. Almost $2 trillion deficit every year. Is that BS. You find running a home or business in that economic state good? Which party always calls for the first cuts to be the DOD? Democrats. And guess what that’s where the VA gets its budget from.\nTrump spent $15 million to attend the Super Bowl. He spent $5 million to take a lap around the racetrack. Numerous times golfing while Americans are crying and unsure of the future. Disgusting. He cares nothing about us.\nI would like to know why the V.A. took the 100% rating from me and put me at 30% by in 1988 . Now the V.A. a few years ago gave me the 100% rating. I was in the Army 1966-1988 . August of 1968 I was in the Army hospital at Fort Polk La. The Army doctor said no more active duty for me. He said I had a bad Heart and could not stay in the Army anymore . So from August 1968 to October 1968 I had no duty . So I sat around for 3 months till they said I could go home with only 30% disability rating . With a bad Heart it was hard to find a job. In August 1981 the V.A. said that they are going to put a artificial heart value . I was rated at 100% 1981. In 1988 V.A. said that I wasn’t sick anymore. They put a valve in so I am OK . So from 100 % back down to 30% . So a few ago 2023 THe V.A. put back to 100% . So my Questions are Why wasn’t given a medical discharge in 1968 . Question 1988 to 2023 why wasn’t I given back pay . I have had a very sad life because of not being able to work .\nTypical VA BS. Over and hour drive for me so I use Community Care, but approvals take forever…But so does sitting at the VA.\nSounds like they should give you a LOT of backpay, but wouldn’t hold my breath. And what’s the deal with all these people in the comments bashing Trump??? He ain’t even been in a month. Not like he can make it much worse?! Bunch of Hanoi Jane wannabes trolling the comments!\nPraying for You and all our Brothers & Sisters dealing with the bureaucracy.\nSincerely,\nWalter Cook\nWas your bad heart the fault of the military..\nI hope all of you that have posted comments or asked questions including me know that the only ones reading these comments/messages/ETC are us and the waste basket, but its interesting to see that many of us have pros and cons on the VA service and the past and present Government. the race of the Turtle and the Hare that the Turtle won bec of caution, determination and a a real consistent approach Once again todays venture Haste makes Waste\nSecretary Collins, I am Henry Dittman, Major, USAF (ret). I just watched your Video Message, re Real Status of VA vs Rumor Mill Vapid, Vacuous B.S. Thanks for the update.. I look forward to seeing you and the NEW Leadership in VA providing support and help for ALL of Veterans.. I have confidence that Pres. Trump wouldn’t have selected you for this position if he didn’t have the UTMOST confidence in your capabilities. Press On, Sir…”Kick the tires and light the fires” and get this Bird in the air!!\nMan have you drank the cool aid!!! This guy is a suck up to Trump who was a draft dodger for Viet Nam! On the plus side the V.A has treated me with respect so I wonder how many of them will be let go?\nIf you look at the rest of the very unqualified people filling cabinet positions, you should understand this one is only marginally better. He’s still a Trump sycophant but if you think that’s okay, so be it. I don’t hold people who openly flout the Constitution in high regard.\nIt’s an insult to think THIS administration has Americas best interest at heart. When his only self-serving whims that DOUG and little donnie care about.\nJust a note. Most of us totally support President Trump’s efforts with DOGE. I for one am very thankful for my local VA and the truly dedicated staff (Topeka, KS).\nI have to believe the new Director of the VA is sincere in his remarks but I have to add my story. I’m 75, I previously applied twice for VA Health Benefits, denied both times. Since the PACT Act I did extensive research to establish and prove my ship did gunfire support in areas of Agent Orange exposure. After 40+ years I was granted VA Health Benefits under what is labeled “Naval Herbicide Service”. I guess no-one wants to say Agent Orange out loud.\nFurther research indicates I have several conditions related to NHS/Agent Orange and I have applied for compensation. That was right at five months ago. I do understand there are probably thousands now applying. Most of my Vietnam era group do not have much time left.\nI received a letter February 17, 2025 dated January 31, 2025 from the Dept. of Veterans Affairs saying they are still processing my application for compensation and apologize for the delay, I would be notified upon completion of processing. No estimation of anticipated date of completion.\nToday I read in the VA Director’s comments ” Veterans Benefits cases are being cleared even faster than ever”.\nDoes that sound like a disconnect to anyone else?\nRome wasn’t built a day, and good things take time. I want to believe the Director’s optimism will come tobe.\nMost of us DO NOT totally support Cap’n Bone Spurs, speak for yourself!\nonly 2 types of veterans exist that don’t support trump. 1 the stolen valor veteran 2. the never seen combat veteran with no pride in their country. put down the kool-aid and your M.A.P magazines.\n“Today I read in the VA Director’s comments ” Veterans Benefits cases are being cleared even faster than ever”.”\nwhat proof do you have of what you are saying or are you just repeating what the trumpers are saying? so much of what has been said as truth turns out to be lies. i pointed out the story in Military.com and for some reason it never showed up here. it is about the firing of over 1000 VA employees.\nI’m sorry it’s been delayed for you. I think the statement about completing faster than ever is because of the recent hiring of claims processors. Especially since the PACT Act, the submissions has increased. Compared to years past, they are moving quicker, slowly chipping away at the backlog in addition to working priority claims (think terminally ill, old Veterans). You can view the current inventory and backlog plus more online. Currently sitting just under 950k.\nUntil recently, processors were working mandatory overtime. Since that is no longer the case, the backlog and claims inventory may go up.\nI hope your claim will be completed soon so you get the benefits you deserve!!\nYou know I do not know why I even wrote a comment. NO BODY reads these anyway. Videos and mailings are just lip service !!!!! They honestly think veterans are just too stupid to know any better. It is so aggravating dealing with the VA. It always has been. The armed forces of America plan and hope everyone gets KIA. It’s cheaper. Much less Veterans to deal with. The only thing is they do need clinics for their budgets. It makes it easier to steal the money. Because it damn sure isn’t going into my bank account. When I see this BS rhetoric. It just pisses me off. I was so ripped off spent 4 years in. Did a good job. I volunteered for extra duty. I went to extra schools so I would be extra qualified so I could volunteer for extra duty. I was passed up for promotions because I am a white man. I entered the Army as an E3 due to four years of JROTC. I GRADUATED Lieutenant Colonel and battalion Commander. I earned drill team Commander for the last three years of high school. We won every drill meet. My Jr. and Senior years to give others schools a chance we went as exhibition only. Because we were so strong and flawless. I and team did not mind. I was even in honor grad in basic training as best drilled individual. I have letters in my file of accommodations. But my skin was too white. When I got to permanent party every single private was promoted to E4. Going through the ranks before me. I entered the Army as an E3 but time in service and time in grade did not mean a damn thing!!! I was even a sponsor for a few of the new E1’s. I was married for 2.5 years before ever joining the Army. Reverse racism really is alive and well. I shook the hands of all of the privates that out ranked me. I was happy for them they did very well and deserved the promotions however I thought I worked as hard if not a little harder due to my volunteering for extra duty. I just wasn’t dark enough. You know you have to keep the numbers in balance. Don’t want too many white men getting a head due to white privileged you know.\nOh Daryl…..so sad you are….and a racist too….white supremacist?\nI read your post. I agree with you. If you’re not black or LGBT or over qualified you get passed over. Black and queer privilege now. I’m praying things change. Thank you for your service. I served in the Navy.\nWow, you actually said that out loud, thank you for being transparent. Many people who have that mindset don’t they just simply smile and deny the most qualified person of color. I am unsure what world you experienced, let me know where this is at where people of color are moving ahead of white men, white women, asian, indian? Please we want to go, quickly!! Minorities always have to have more education, more experience and change our appearance to be considered. Hey all you blacks, listen up there is a place where we are getting put ahead of white men and women WITHOUT EXPERIENCE and EDUCATION!!! We going please tell us. Believe it or not, some people are actually more qualified than you, yep even black and brown folks. I know in my family alone we have: Neuro Surgeons, medical doctors, lawyers, chemist, educators, high ranking military enlisted and officers and News reporters for major channels, but they all have that 1 thing : EDUCATION and they have to EARN their positions and watch people with LESS get the positions. BTW, I watched young white girls get positions without experience because white men wanted their cute faces over qualified WHITE MEN, and us others!!! S\nI read both your posts and I totally disagree, if you really did your homework you will see that there are far more white soldiers in the military than there are black or any other race, and I know that LGBT isn’t a race or on any soldiers report card! Do I think that there is bias when it comes to promotions yes I certainly do, but to say that you have to black or queer (as you put it) to get ahead is just not true. Also there has NEVER been and will NEVER be Black or queer privileged in the military, and praying that things change says something about you!!!\nI am a third generation veteran who is currently APPALLED by the actions of the new presidential administration. Reading through the comments of my fellow vets, it is clear that the overwhelming majority DO NOT HAVE FAITH in Trump or Musk, or that their actions won’t end up hurting the VA. You know, so they can free up funds for giant tax cuts for the wealthy. What we really need now are strong advocates for the VA, not apologists for Trump.\nIts interesting about the Office of DOGE Government efficiency is a big joke i am from CA so i am very aware of\nGovernment efficiency i continue to watch one of biggest income state in the USA 5th largest in the world going downhill every day because of the ridiculous spending of taxpayers money Just like some of the large major companies that have gone bankrupt because no one is controlling the expenses I hope that the rest of the country doesnt follow CA I just hope that Trumps effort to Make America Great Again Hasnt gone to far in Haste Makes Waste\nit would be better to proceed with caution\nI have no faith in this new administration. The lack of professionalism is astounding. All my years working with Veterans I’ve never seen such unprofessional behavior by a top leadership. This isn’t a campaign rally it’s a honorable institution serving honorable Veterans. Secretary your statement about not reducing Veterans Administration funds is a very empty statement. 1000 VA staff members have been fired. Many of them are Veterans and some are Disabled Veterans. You are a not in service to Veterans. You are only serving the traitor Trump.\nWell, at least the news is good, we’re finally getting what we voted for, even if the video link doesn’t work ( yes, I tried it in both email and browser, it doesn’t let me watch it because it says I’m not signed in, even though I’m signed in over on YouTube. And it doesn’t give me an option to sign in on the video itself).\nYou are an absolute liar. Lying to veterans is a total disgrace.\nIf you think trump/musk care about you, you are not very intelligent.\nnever trust trump and musk to do what’s right for veterans. I understand there could be a real reason behind the job cuts, but I’m do not understand the inhumane way it was done — no respect\ntrump is a draft dodger and has already called veterans “suckers and losers”. He does not care\nYou sound like a liberal communist. Trump cares about Veterans . Biden had soldiers sleeping on a garage floor, Trump put them in his Hotel. He is cleaning up government waste and strengthening our military and stopping this woke crap. Things will be way better under this administration. I’m sick of ignorant people commenting negativity.\nHey Kiva, Sounds like you should do a bit of fact checking before you accuse people of sounding like a “liberal communist” and being “ignorant people commenting negativity.” How do you interpret Trump caring for veterans when he faked a bone spur to dodge the draft, calls us suckers and losers and does not want to be seen in our company? Maybe you’re watching too much Fox News.\nWrong, Trump doesn’t care about veterans or the military, never has, never will. Maybe you should wake up, read something other than drivel, and realize you’re supporting a draft dodging coward.\nClearly, your TDS has warped your simple mind. Clinton was a draft dodger and all you dimocrats still worship the Clintons. Trump never called our veterans “suckers and losers”. Where was your outrage when Biden said “clap, you stupid bastards” right to our active duty military? Typical dimocrat hypocrite!\nYou might look into just who the new sign in procedures are supposed to be helping. I am an 82yo Vet who has been using the MyHealth.va site for probably as long as it has been in existence with varying degrees of success. Now comes the new double sign, double verification system which is completely beyond my grasp. I have spent many hours trying to comply but as things stand now, On March 4, I will no longer be able to access my information. I suspect this is make work for contractors. How do you “make thing simpler by adding extra steps? Anyway, I’ll survive until I don’t. Good luck in your new position.\nHi, William. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThanks for sharing that was total BS. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nDon thinks we are suckers\nand so must you.\nI’ve had several issues with injuries/issues caused from the military service that have been denied several times. I really don’t expect anyone under Doug Collins or, Doug Collins himself to read this, but my faith in the VA is very little.\nHi, James. Thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThank you for caring for our veterans.\nI feel like we have one of our own (veteran) watching our six. All the best to him and president Trump.\nThis is the “VA”!!!! I believe are benefits will probably WILL be taken away. It’s just a matter of time. We do not get any raises! Except for COLA. That’s all we are worth. I do not believe President Trump will take it away but I know we will NOT be getting any raises!!!!! We are veterans. They don’t get raises. They aren’t worth any more money than they are getting now. We can’t say a word in fear of it being taken away. It has taken 34 years to break the $500.00 mark of monitory payment. That’s Thirty four years!!!!!\nThis sounds good, but doesn’t align with reality. Perhaps the large # of VA employees released occurred after this video was cut. Regardless, it’s difficult to believe that this downsizing will improve services. There has to be an impact when those who operate and support the Veteran Suicide Hotline receive notices of termination. Veterans are reporting scheduled appointments are being canceled. The messaging from the VA needs to be factual and convincing. Today that is not the case.\nBut no medical personell have been terminated from the VA. Only staff positions, most of which were working from home and did not want to return to the office. Regardless, these personell were offered a buyout which many accepted.\nPersonally, I have had no problems with appointment or staff having received 2 appointments in the last month. I think that we need to be a bit patient considering that the new administration has made many promises and is working tirelessly to keep those promises. Cutting waste, fraud and abuse….Money that is going to politicians instead of to the deficit or the taxpayer… is going to go slowly but I choose to believe that the process will ultimately prove to be a good one for our country.\nPoliticians never fight so hard as when their illicit money is threatened and a lot of our politicians really seem to hate the idea of organizations like USAID being audited.\nLet’s not make it a problem before it is a problem. If you really think that there is foul play afoot you should contact your senator or congressman and voice your concerns.\nJust my humble opinions…. Thanks for your service !!\nLarge number? 1000 out of almost half a million VA employees. Probably like the FAA firings. Janitorial and lawn maintenance staff. I’m sure that will create a care problem from the medical staff. Or those doing claims.\nDoug: Tell me what DOGE and the Muskrats are cutting and eliminating that constitutes waste, fraud, and abuse in the VA. Tell me exactly how you and the Muskrats are improving efficiency. I’ve had enough of ‘it’s gonna be great’ BS. No transparency, no TRUST!\nElon Musk literally posts on x all of the fraud and wasteful spending that DOGE finds. Just because you don’t bother to go read the information, doesn’t mean that it’s not out there.\nI am positively tickled that we are finally purging these money laundering mafias like US”AID” that have infested our government, squandering tax victim money on ungrateful foreign parasites.\nI’ll believe it when I see it. With all due respect, I don’t buy anything that comes out of trump’s mouth, which makes me extremely disinclined to believe anything that you tell me, Doug. You seem to be in lockstep with this administration, and I don’t trust them at all. Trump likes to give lip service about caring for the troops and for our veterans, but his actions tell another story. The bottom line is, you have to prove it, or it’s just more glad handing and empty promises.\nI would like to know why so many Veterans that spent as much as 25 years in the military and took a government job that are at the end of their probation was cut just because they are on probation.\nThey spent their entire life in the military and now fired, regardless of their job and outstanding skills just because they had not completed their probation period.\nVeterans are losing their homes because our President doesn’t want to take the time see what their job is. If you are telling the truth then make Veterans on probation exempt.\nGood Morning. Thank you for reaching out with this video. Unfortunately, your words offer little assurance to the disabled veteran/military retiree communities. You talk about “media” stories mentioning “possibilities” that veteran benefits may be cut, that “means testing” may be used to determine disability benefits, and the privatization of VA services in general. I read a lot and can honestly say I’ve never read a story about veteran benefit cuts originating in main stream media outlet. What I’ve read are main stream media stories reporting on alternative media sites bringing forth this type of information. Isn’t that the job of the media? To inform us? You say none of this is true. Not surprising, you’re the only person saying this. You come across as a fast talking late night TV Cal Worthington and his dog Spot type car salesman. Hello! Red Flag! Here’s the deal. We all know your unwavering loyalty to the current occupant of the White House(forgive me, in no way can I type or say his name) got you the job. It’s just too difficult for many of us to trust you for choosing loyalty to a convicted felon over the millions of veterans you now serve. Good luck.\nThank you so much for communicating with us Veterans! Please keep on doing this. Maybe a monthly meeting online summarizing what is happening with the VA.\nWhen will these benefits be published in a handbook print again with ALL contact information.?\nWhen will the VA have a functional phone system that is user friendly to discover these benefits that only a few have knolage off?\nMr. Collins:\nThank you for your video about VA benefits not being cut. Your information is appreciated.\nA suggestion….begin your videos with the information you wish to share. Do not belittle the media. Much of what you criticized the media for is exactly what this administration is doing on a daily basis.\nI am proud to be a veteran. And I applaud the VA for the excellent care I have received. And I hope the VA continues to care for all veterans in the best ways possible.\nI am an elderly female veteran who lives on my VA and Social Security benefits . If this administration touches either of these two things, there will be an uprising like you’re never before seen. We’ve worked all our lives to get here, broken down and barely getting by. And I’ll be damned if I (and millions of others) will stand by and allow billionaires to play with our lives and our money!! Our government had better put protections in place and stop this madness going around!\nThank you so much for running this explanation. WE never know who or what to believe when so many negative “reports” come out the “liberal media”. So, it is really important that our SecVA comes right out and clears up the matter. JRMack, IL Army Vet\nWow! So much hate and discontent on this forum. I’m surprised the VA allows. This content to be on a veterans administration site. So many people really showing their ass. Sad. To the folks who screen these posts I would recommended to your chain of command, that this forum go away. The hate and finger-pointing here solves nothing. There’s a VA phone number to call and I’m sure there’s a VA email to send your grievances to. This forum is nothing more than watching MSNBC.\nAgreed. US ARMY vet.\nAmen my Brother Veteran. We served with Honor and our president Trump did us right in his first term, and why would he change now. Anybody remember serving under president Carter. I do.\nYou could always volunteer to not come here or comment yourself first. How about that & not parroting far right propaganda? I vote for that.\nI applaud the VA keeping all comments. It’s important. To provide some context, I’m a retired veteran (25 years, from E-1 to O4), and just yesterday, I was speaking with my neighbor and good friend who is 86 years young. He had tears in his eyes as he asked me if his 30 years of service (ending as CMSgt) meant anything, given the state of the government right now. Grow up and read the comments. You might learn something about people who’ve sacrificed and then who get the runaround, or worse. Not everyone has a great story to tell; some have reasonable grievances and concerns.\nVince, I totally agree with you!\nTell me how these DOGE clowns and Musk are qualified to tell Veterans what is a waist of money on them? Musk has never served in the military. He knows nothing of sacrifice or hardship.\nMusk is a naturalized South American……and the richest man in the world. Donnie despises him because he is richer than Donnie. His time will come\nMy faith in the VA is now in question. I don’t trust the officials in charge under this sorry presidency and administration. Waiting for the next Russian hammer to fall. I’ve had wonderful care for the past 30+ years and now I’m concerned. I’ve already had medication issues over the past year.\nI’ve already had medication issues over the past year….That would have been under Sorry President Biden.\nI appreciate all the good work that you and the new Administration are doing. Here’s a stupid question, tho – why is there a higher threshold & harder process for us veterans to get the help that the government’s already promised us, when they already have all our paperwork and we already proved ourselves to them, than it is to get welfare, even as an illegal? ??\nDoes *any* other government agency penny-pinch down to a fraction of a percent? Is that *really* a necessary part of the process when tax victim dollars are walking out the door by the billions and trillions unaccounted for (until DOGE), squandered on thankless foreign parasites?\nmy prayer is that your leadership will I have been trying to get my case settled since 2014 my claim was successfully remanded 10/2024 but still no settlement information to this date.\nIs the Russian hammer in the room with you right now? Geez, are you hearing yourself?\nDid anything happen to our VA benefits in the first Orange Age? No, my veterans disability claim was finally fully recognized only after president Trump with the VA into shape, and VA Healthcare massively improved (and then went back downhill under Creepy Joe).\nSrsly, seek out the mental health services on offer, this paranoid hysteria is not healthy, and is frankly unbecoming of a former servicemember. The Cold War ended over 30 years ago, let it go.\nThank you! People bashing Trump and saying stupid ignorant comments are ridiculous! A bunch of liberal Commies…\nWell, you folks keep on calling liberals commies–Right? Well how about Trump supporting Putin against Ukraine and Europe! Last I knew, Putin is a commie! But I bet you people love him as Trump does! Yupper, Putin is innocent regarding his invasion of the Ukraine. And it is Zelenskyy who is the Dictator and the Ukraine which started the war? Donald has serious mental issues it seems. And as for the VAMCs, if not for Democrats, they wouldn’t exist. Republicans time and time over the years have never voted to increase funding for veteran services! And in fact the opposite is true. They love pulling the wool over veterans eyes by putting forth their age old argument, that my cutting out waste it will help veterans, when in fact, what they really mean is that they believe way too much money is spent on veterans care and services.\nAnd as for you all complaining that you are waiting years for VA approval of care for your conditions, just read this and then go thank your Republicans for trying to do nothing to help our veterans:\n“The legislation is an attempt to hide the fact that House Republicans already voted to immediately rescind $2 billion from funding for claims processing and appeals, health care both within and outside of VA, research, and education and training for veterans as part of the Default on America Act.\nThis bill:\nDrastically underfunds by $14.7 billion the Toxic Exposures Fund, created with bipartisan support in the PACT Act to ensure veterans exposed to Agent Orange, burn pits, and other toxic substances will always be cared for.\nUnderfunds other veterans’ medical care needs by allowing the transfer of $4.5 billion in medical care funding to areas outside of health care.\nCuts funding for critical military construction. The bill backtracks on our promises to our servicemembers and their families by cutting military construction by over $1.3 billion compared to the current level.\nBuilt on a framework that fails to treat veterans’ medical care as its own funding category, thereby jeopardizing veterans’ health care.”\nBut regardless, thank you all for your service!\nBut I guess it was ok when it was Biden or Obama getting bashed…People have the right to their opinions, you don’t have to like it or agree but its their right, it doesn’t make them commies (as you call them), it makes them American!\nDear Secretary Collins,\nRegarding the 1000+ VA employees you just fired, what are you doing about them? Why fire them with NO heads up, in the dark of the night, no severance, or opportunity to move to other positions? What about those VA employees that you pulled the rug out from under who are Veterans that wanted to serve the Veteran community by working for the VA? Those who you fired that are Veterans, disabled Veterans, who moved cross country specifically for that job? For those who are living paycheck to paycheck that now may need to seek out homeless services?\nFrankly, if you want to cut costs, try examining the obviously CORRUPT Compensation and Pension “examination” process!!! I’ve been to numerous of those hideous “exams” where the “examiner” flat out LIES on their DBQs/opinions!!! Seriously, they flat out LIE!!! And even though the Veteran is supposed to have the benefit of doubt, the VA ONLY goes by the lying C&P “examiners” who strategically move the conversation from the Veteran’s symptoms, issues, residuals, etc., etc. to get the Veteran off track and then say, “Well, we’re out of time, now. Thank you for coming in.” And they got their nice big pay check and bonus from the VA!\nThe Veteran NEEDS to be able to have access to the blank DBQs ahead of time, to submit DBQs from their own doctors who know the Veteran better, and have immediate access to the C&P “examiner’s” completed DBQ/opinion immediately following it’s completion… PRIOR to the VA making a decision, so the Veteran has a chance and PLENTY of time to respond appropriately! That whole system is corrupt, corrupt, corrupt, and causes far too much stress and anxiety to Veterans who already experience much of that! And I know I’m not the only one who knows this.\nSUGGESTION – reach out to YouTube channels: CivDiv and Veterans InfoTap (or Veterans Daily which is a collaboration between the two).\nAll that said, I understand the reason behind the job cuts, but I’m at a LOSS for the nasty, deceitful, and inhumane way you went about it… much like running those employees, and their families, over with a bus!\nPlease do something to help them get back on their feet after this disaster? Are you going to help them with job placement services? Food assistance? Rent/mortgage assistance? Please do SOMETHING for them!\nAlso, PLEASE do something about the anxiety inducing corrupt C&P “exam” process!?\nThank you for your attention, and for tolerating my “passion” and deep frustration with this “system”!\nThank you for your service, and God bless!\nSandra (Sandy) Sutter\nHow is firing long-term employees ( a lot of them are Veterans themselves) helping to streamline our services? Will you stand up for us when things are wrong? Or are you just going to let Musk cut our programs that help Veterans????\nMR Collins,\nHow can you possibly believe, we believe,\nthat Trump/Musk will leave the VA unscathed?\nMusk is tearing thru the Gov’t agencies at alarming speed, with NO oversight. He is not an elected official, nor does he have the authority to de-evolve the Govt just because Trump has such a big grudge against everybody.\nMusk is overbearing and has ABSOLUTLY no cares for/about US Servicemembers. Neither does Trump.\nWill you RESIGN if your statements prove UNTRUE?\nBy the way this was on the latest feed from Military.com , “VA Crisis Line Employees Among Those Fired Amid Federal Workforce Purge”\nGood afternoon, Sir. I just read about the lies that the VA is looking into cutting down service for us veterans. At the same time, you just stated that is not true, thank God, please keep doing whatever you can for us Sir. I wrote a letter to our REAL President Mr. DONALD TRUMP, about the fact that us veterans must wait years after we applied for our disability. I applied back in May 1923, and I am still pending for that to be resolved.\nI personally, have seen other veterans that have waited for a very long periods of time, and the representatives that are performing this process, at the VA department, I am not sure of what the problem is, but it takes years to receive their so needed and well-deserved disability pension after serving our country, and plenty of us, like in my case, I was exposed to Agent Orange during my service in the Army while in Korea during the times specified by the V.A., within the notification that I received in order to apply, the VA informed me that I qualified to apply for a disability pension.\nI have submitted every piece of documentation, including letters of support from all my doctors’ Nexus Letter on my behalf my documents that the VA asked for, but I am still waiting for a positive resolution to my case.\nI am now wearing a pacemaker because I had a stroke back in 2023, receiving an IV Infusion once a month, and according to Doctor Viviana Temino, MD Section Chief, Allery & Immunology under her treatment since 2014 and I must continue receiving the Infusion for the rest of my life do to the fact that I was exposed to Agent Orange, also now I have spots on my lungs do to the same exposure and I am also been treated with Sulfamethoxazole 800mg 4 capsules a day for the infection in my lungs for at least six months. Furthermore, I have to take numerous medications every day, three different inhalers because of COPD and Asthma, blood pressure medication, blood thinners because of the stroke because different blockage in my veins, including my brain and to top it all, I also have been seen by the Psychologist due to all the stress and a counselor once a week because all the waiting, going into three years. Medication for my stomach, (acid indigestion). Under the care of DR. Eduardo J Lopez M.D. with the Blue team at the VA Hospital, him, Dr. Lopez, also reiterated the fact of that my treatments are forever Dr. Italo Novoa M.D., my cardiologist, and I am constantly going to the VA hospital for all the treatments that I need plus all the medications that I have to take daily because my immune system has been destroyed by the effects of the Agent Orange that was, not only this chemical agent was sprayed in Camp Stanley because of this camp was so close to the DMV zone, but also was stored in the same camp, Camp Stanley.\nPlease Sir, we can use all the help that we can get.\nThank you,\nArmando G. Torres\n[Editor: Please do not publish your SSN or other personal information on the internet. I have deleted it from your comment.]\nAre you claiming to be over 120 years old and that agent orange was used in Korea rather than vietnam? ? Something about your story doesn’t quite add up.\nI know how you feel. Took me several years to even get my records. Vetrecs kept telling me they didn’t have them.\nWith all due respect Sir, you must be the oldest veteran alive. Thank you for your service.\nIn other words, “DOGE” which doesn’t really exist, does have access to our personal records. Thanks for clarifying.\nthey are screening emails. Trump: “Senator McCain was a loser “he got caught” You Trump-loving vets need a reality check. Trump was Never a friend to vets. His only friend are stacks of 100 Ben Franklins. He refused to visit the American cemetery when invited in France…and then labeled them “Suckers & Losers”\nFour more years of lunacy. I pray we still have a country after he’s gone. Don’t forget, he is challenging the 8-year term limit. He wants to be a Putin or Stalin. Die a King.\nIt’s funny, after president Donald J Trump took office, my veterans disability claim was finally fully recognized, and I got enough of those Benjamins that my wife and I were able to buy two homes.\nJessica, please look into the mental health services offered by the VA, this hysterical paranoia is not healthy.\nAs for mccain, well he should have known better to stay a hero rather than letting himself become the villain. Please, enlighten me as to what is respectable about an old man wanting to throw young men into a meatgrinder of *his* political ambitions?\nSpot On Jessica!\nNice try! Got any other fantasy BS you’d like to share with us! Got to admit that people like you sure have learned from your dear leader, how to lie so well!\nTDS – was debunked!\nhttps://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/06/27/biden-trump-first-presidential-debate/about-those-suckers-and-losers-00165625\nJessica, quit telling lies….. Trump loves the Veterans….. sucker and looser was more then once debunked as a lie…. you people get all upset bc he wants to clean house. you know there is a lot of waste in the VA….. office staff is the once who got let go, didn’t want to go back to office, nor medical people……. I had never problem with my VA in Asheville, you believe anything the left made you belief…… you had no problem the media told you Biden was fit for 4 years, I bet you voted for crackling Camel\nTrump did not refuse to visit the American cemetery in France.This excerpt from American Military News offers an explanation: “President Trump reportedly had no say in the decision, as the Marine Corps and White House Military Office made the determination collaboratively with the Secret Service that Paris’ overcast and rainy conditions posed too much risk for Marine One to fly to Aisne-Marne, which is about 60 miles northeast of Paris.”\nHow many of the staffers fired were veterans themselves?\nCan you tell me how many veterans have already been fired from government jobs\ni am a Viet Nam veteran. i was exposed to agent orange. I am receiving benefits because of this exposure. please continue your vigilant concern regarding veterans benefits. Thank you, John Brich\nI see you are a TRUMP fan so I do not know what to believe.\nFirst and foremost advice, stop the politics. This video and message grated on my severely. An assurance that benefits will not be cut would have sufficed. I assure you, inserting politics into the MISSION of serving veterans will only lead to undesirable outcomes. I previously worked at the VA at the management level and political stances and opinions are not to be voiced publicly.\nThank you for the reassurance, good luck, and best wishes in your new position.\nFor the moment, I will take the Secretary at his word that VA benefits will not be cut. In comment on his remarks about DOGE and the press, I emphasize the following: First, it is the responsibility of Secretary Collins and his staff to fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. Our tax dollars fund this audit and investigative function of the VA and other law enforcement agencies. Elon Musk and DOGE should not assume this duty. Second, the rule of law and ethics in government matter. Musk is riddled with conflicts of interest as a large government contractor and an owner of regulated businesses. Numerous Americans have lost their federal jobs based on the untruthful disparagement of federal agencies and disregard for the rule of law. We have regulations that provide fair procedures for the reduction of the federal work force and expenditure of our tax dollars, which have been dashed by DOGE. (BTW, the name “DOGE” is an unethical promotion of Musk’s favored cryptocurrency and misleading because it is not a Department of government.) Third, demonizing the press has long been a tool of regime change. Information is power and both Musk and Trump control significant media outlets. Secretary Collins should not attack the press, especially when transparency in government is in peril. (As an aside, our names and emails are required to post on this site. I do not consent to allowing anyone connected to DOGE to have access to my email. )\n“An” email address is required, but it doesn’t have to be yours. I’m using Senator Rand Paul’s\nI’m so excited about our new administration straightening this mess out. I’m a veteran and a RN and know first hand the system is broke. Change maybe hard but it’s very much needed! You have my full support! I’m thankful accountability and common sense are now being used, years late but better late than never.\nI have no faith in the VA as long as Elon (the Pillsbury Doughboy) is in charge. Keep politics out you say? Impossible. Everything about the grift-meister Trump is politics. Victim politics. Retribution politics. If put my name to this post, guaranteed he and his band of adolescent hackers will ferret me out and deep six me in the VA system. Trump IS a pathetic example of a human.\nDo you deny Trump & Elon are using the presidency to profit beyond their wildest dream? Wake up-smell the coffee.\nWhat does any of that hysterical paranoid rant have to do with the good news from the va?\nPlease, look into the mental health care services that are on offer.\nWhy would we trust what you are saying? Time will tell and I hope you are legitimate, prepared and successful in protecting/improving our care. Thank you.\nI had to wait 3 months just to get a dentist appointment. I’ve been waiting 3 months just to get community of care to approve a doctor that I’ve already selected. What the hell are you fools doing? No thank you King Trump. I don’t like what you’re doing.\nMy husband has to wait longer than 3 months!\nHi, Carl, thanks for commenting. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nRight!!! The firings have already started in the chem dependency program. Doug will role over like all the rest of the lackeys.\nP.S. I have been under the care of VA medicine at Lovell FHC for 20 years. I would not trade it for any amount of money. I’m not going to bore with how they discovered my Agent Orange cancer on my very first visit, or how they rebuilt a badly mangled foot from and accident, or any of the other dozens of services they have provided me over the years. I have sat in waiting rooms and listened to vets my age and younger complain about waiting 30 minutes. Complain about this. Complaining about that. OMG….millions of people in this country never get to see a doctor and these entitled little f-cks just complain about services they get for mostly free. I’m going to offer a totally white American suggestion. If you are so f-cking unhappy with VA medicine, take your sorry -ss back out into the private healthcare industry and die sooner.\nThe worst thing VA did previously was ordering referrals of Veterans to community service. VA administratorts , prior to referral, never checked the delays in the private sector service being requested, which in Albuquerque are ~twice the delay at VAMC. VA administrators never insisted on getting reports from the referral doctor, and paid for private care before checking that reports were received: payment should always be deferred until reports are in the VA record. A delay of 6 months to being seen in the private sector can change a cancer prognosis from operable to inoperable. All attenmpts to “privatize ” VA should be strongly resisted. In most cases VA offers the most rapid access, excellent care ,and adequate follow-up.\nA reduction in force is a reduction in benefits. Our VA office wwnt from 4 to 2 people, and changed the blood draws from appointment to walkin. My friend who has advanced parkinsons had to wait 2 hours for a blood draw. He is in no shape to wait that long. Please try to keep in touch with ground conditions so you wont look so out of it.\nBro, IDK if you noticed, but the VA offices have been short staffed ever since the red-plague lockdowns, just like every place else.\nIs there anything that this Musk “presidency” would lead you to believe anything they say ? unvetted..not elected…has added billions to his private funds…please, we had to take tests (ergo the ability read and comprehend) to join the military…we are not stupid!!!\nDid you pass a basic civics test about how the American government actually works??\nDo you understand that Elon Musk is *not* the president, nor was he on the ballot, nor can he ever be POTUS, because he’s South African by birth?\n“I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans.” So we “get rid of…”, people. Firing approximately 1000 staffers, is sure to help with veterans health, claims, well being, etc. Great quote from the White House clown show.\num….you do know there are 371K VA staff in America right?\nReally want efficiency get the contractors out of VBA. My experience is unimpressive. I was referred to a contract nurse to assess my heart. Nurse did not take an EKG. Nurse asked me about medication and measured my scars from the heart surgery. Later I received notice that I must have an echocardiogram and drive about 40 miles to the contractor’s site. I live less than a mile from from a hospital with clinics. Finally I was told I needed to get a echocardiogram and have it faxed by a suspense date. Called my cardiologist and arranged for the echocardiogram. Contractor is churing account for profit. Sent to a NP with post doctorial work in PTSD and the NP was to evaluate me for hypothyroidism. Said I had no symptoms. I suggested I had no symptoms because I have been on medication for years and treated by the head of dendrochronology at the Univ Maryland Upper Chesapeake Hospital He wrote a letter that said I he has been treating me for this for years and stated that I had something that was 30% disability in the law. VBA questioned. Seems the VBA contractor has a list of service providers and picks the next on the lit rather than a provider that is near the veteran. Look at that scheduling process.\nFunny my simple dependency update has been sitting untouched since submitted back in July 2024! Can’t imagine those actually needing something done when a simple dependent correction can’t move.\nReferring to Mr Thomas Lee your remarks\nSound like the cry babies protesting about our commander and chief that’s finally draining t he swamp\nAre you a disabled Vet? I am and it sounds like you are not…\nI am a disabled vet and agree with his comment\nWow the true TDS is someone who worships an orange, privileged, racist, silver spoon, veteran hating, criminal draft dodger.\nI agree with all the people pointing out that the Muskrats are not qualified to do any adequate work on saving money… except for moving it to Musk and other billionaires — and the criminal draft dodger, as you rightly point out.\nI also think that military leaders should hold strong to truth. If all people would speak up, we could stop the tearing up of our country.\nDOGE under Musk has only hackers. They have NO forensic accountants to look at the data they have stolen. The are yelling fraud and waste but can’t prove any of it, and they are not being held to account. I don’t believe that the VA should show then a thing unless there is oversight by competent independent accountants and others who understand how things work. Musk and his bunch no nothing about how government programs function and they have no idea how many people they have already seriously hurt. And they don’t care.\nAnother LIE from the musk trump regime\nAnd your evidence for this is where? Surely, as a fellow former servicemember yourself, you would have enough integrity to not be making false accusations, would you?\nYou and the new administration are cutting VA workers without justification ( or even knowing what they do) how is this going to help veterans ?\nAnother trump liar. Its sad you are lying to our brave veterans. And horrific that you support the self proclaimed King!\nHe doesn’t care about anyone including you. You are a pawn in his ugliness. He will get rid of you and retaliate against you too.\nVeterans deserve to be treated like hero’s, not rump and muskrat.\nI feel sorry for your family, they must be so disappointed and shameful you.\nI am extremely skeptical of what the Secretary is saying. What exactly is doge doing? What has the Secretary permitted them to access? There appears to be little or NO transparency!!!\nMr. Secretary, No, DOGE is not a government entity and the VA should NOT partner with musk.\nYou will be striped by so called DOGE and the veterans will suffer. Mark my word.\nEach tim Trump has said that something is off the table the cuts happen anyway. He said he would review his list of insurrectionists and if they were violent they wouldn’t be considered. Welllook what happened. Now he’s looking at Madicare. My dad CMSgt. Z.C. Littleton is 93 and served in the Air Force in SAC and involved in many operations during the Cold War including Operation Chrome Dome and in and out of Vietnam while we lived at Naha, Okinawa and Clark, PI. Don’t blame me if I don’t trust him at his word!\nWhat insurrectionists? Are you talking about the political prisoners that were kidnapped for simply exercising their First Amendment rights at a public government building? Yeah, you sound like another big mouth civilian Army brat who never actually took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\nNaval officer Robert A. Heinlein was absolutely right, it was a mistake to allow civilian political power over us by something as unearned as birth.\nAirman….you are so wrong. Killing a cop and causing multiple injuries to those protecting our democratic process, was not ‘Patriotic”. They should all still be in jail, not pardoned.\nCDR USN (ret)\nCDR, the only shooting was done by a Capitol police Lt who has since been promoted. He took careful aim, stepped forward and shot Ashley Babbott in the neck. Ashley bled to death as the camera rolled. WE saw this happen LIVE. And there were Capitol cops with long guns right behind her. A cold blood case of murder. That Lt should be in jail, not promoted. Only Capitol cops brought weapons on Jan 6.\nIt’s well documented that the VA recently fired one thousand probationary staffers. This means that benefits are already “cut” for those veterans who need VA services, as the pipeline will get even slower. I feel for my fellow vets who rely on the VA for healthcare and related services and I worry this will only get worse.\nWhy does the VA only allow 100% disabled people to access dentistry?\nthats avery good question i wanted to ask that My guess is that the VA Dentist clinic is most likely an outside referral\ngroup and the VA doesnt want to pay for anyone not havent 100 % disability\nThat’s actually a fantastic question, the answer to which I have searched for far and wide myself. The best that I’ve been able to find is an answer is that way back when, the dentist industry lobbied tooth and nail to not have to accept certain forms of insurance, and here we are today.\nThough that still doesn’t explain why the va’s *own* in-house dentist office is so hard to access even for those of us who are at 100% disability.\nHow many veterans died of Covid 19 from misinformation?\nSir, someone needs to advise you that the Veterans Crisis Line has been cut by approximately 1,000 employees. These people provide intervention when a Veteran is contemplating suicide – a recognized epidemic among vets. Please use your authority to get these people their jobs back with back pay. Allowing DOGE (an illegal and unconstitutional entity) to damage veteran healthcare simply cannot be tolerated. Any and all veteran deaths will be at your doorstep and for you to answer.\nFunny because already up here in Connecticut I’ve been knowington VA thinks I’ve already changed. Their people who are sending emails out to Veterans saying they’ll be out of the office until further notice people aren’t getting through it can be an hour and a half sometimes before you get through to somebody and the folks just seem to be in some kind of turmoil there. And I’ve actually heard it said that yeah we don’t know what’s going on but something’s going on. So when he started his conversation with Trump is doing what he said he was going to do I knew we were for an -ss wipe yeah I don’t think we need to believe this guy look at what’s actually going on they’re cutting people from the Veterans Administration I was told that the only people there weren’t cutting at one of the veterans Administrations are the nurses because they’re essential but yeah they’re chopping people left and right\nWe shall see! Are you sure that there are not medical professionals losing their jobs at the VA???? Because that is not what I heard! Not even those on a probationary hire??? Historically, the Republican Party has given nothing but lip service to the vets! Check it out see how many republicans voted against veteran’s bills! Prove me wrong! Rest assured if I or any other vet suffers any reprisals the news outlets will be notified.\nYou understand president Donald J Trump is not the Republican party, right? He’s the fire we elected to burn the GOP to the ground, and on its ashes build an actual pro-America party.\nBut let’s talk about how many bloodthirsty Democrat cowards sent our people to die in unjustified illegal wars ( fun facts, every American war after World War II has been unconstitutional because it hasn’t actually been voted for by Congress), or how Democrat Golden Boy JFK wantingly sprayed agent orange on our troops knowing that chemical warfare was illegal.\nthey didn’t vote against Veterans, they voted against the pork the Democrats added to the Bill. They only said “veterans” to blast Rs. The worst R was mcCain who voted against Americans, including veteran.\nRemember that his boss called us veterans “suckers” and “losers”.\nDon’t be a sucker or a loser. We worked hard and lost much for the benefits we have.\nHis boss has a 50 year record of reneging on promises. Do not believe him or any of his mouthpieces.\nIam a veteran never had any problems with VA or care . One think I believe tho is that Combat Veterans should never have to beg or depend on anyone but the Goverment to take care of them if you are a combat Veteran you deserve everthing you need to help get your life back and their spouses and kids should also be on the health insurance. Combat Veterans are entitled to more period\nDoug Collin’s word is not enough. There is a $6 billion budget shortfall for 2025.\nOn February 13, 2025, the VA announced the termination of over 1,000 probationary employees with less than two years of service. These dismissals affect various roles, including researchers in mental health, cancer treatments, addiction recovery, prosthetics, and burn pit exposure.\nI don’t trust a word from Collin’s as he was selected by Trump both of them are pathological liars.\nIn their Budget they show $9 trillion in cost savings. No comment on where the savings are coming from;. Trump is not sharing this as he is simply arraigning as none of this will matter anymore.\nMr. Collin’s,\nAnything that has to do with improving the VA and Doge is an oxymoron! Cuts to help improve? Layoff notices at the Milwaukee VA or any other VA facility? Vets have seen this disrespect from our Commander in Chief before. Do not insult me with this BS. You should know better.\nHmm, tell that to the vets working at the VA who got laid off for BS “poor performance”. Vets are speaking out how some of them got stellar performance reviews only to be let go days later. Way to look out for us vets. As some have pointed out, especially those who were laid off with disabilities, there is legal recourse for wrongful termination.\nMy husbands appeal has been waiting for a judge for years. His body is breaking down due to his past military career. He is in constant pain. He fought Multiple wars and conflicts. Gulf war veterans are being pushed aside. He was one of the first to cross the burm to Iraq in the ACE tanks. He don’t even try to talk about Somalia or the other conflicts. These men deserve better. Please help these soldiers. They fought for us and risk their lives for us. The government doesn’t have time to waste. Make our Veterans a priority!!!\nAmen ! Praying your husband gets his help asap.\nfirstly this site should not be used to attack the media or your political enemies Mr Collins. secondly I’d like to say that I have been very satisfied with the service that I’ve received from the VA both in Iowa City Iowa as well as in Des Moines\nSUBMIT A CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY TO YOUR STATES CONGRESSMAN. THEY FORWARD YOUR REQUEST TO THE VA AND THE VA IS REQUIRED TO RESPOND WITHIN 72 HOURS OF RECEIPT!! This action should expedite the claim. It did when I did it.\nI find it interesting that the day after this article posted, another article talked about VA people being laid off and the crisis line purged. Anyone who thinks our benefits aren’t on the chopping block is drinking the koolaid.\nAnd you expect us to believe this? VA staffing has already been cut by Trump. We have fewer VA representatives at different levels than we had two months ago. You are completely right about the media and how they work. But their spin on things is nowhere close to the spin that the government puts on things expecting us to believe them. And it has been worse these last two months with all the government firings and the cuts, human and financial, at many of the government offices. Why do you continually believe and treat us as if we are so stupid we cannot figure this out and are not able to know the truth? And the truth about DOGE and their requests and demands for personal information does nothing to help any of us, but is another verification of us losing our personal and private lives and information. This information they receive will do nothing but hurt American individuals. That can be verified easily by looking at the person that is in charge of that.\nThe VA already does not have enough employees in healthcare to provide veterans with healthcare services they need. Which means if Doug Collins and the VA are working on good faith to improve veterans access to healthcare, they should be hiring new employees, not firing va healthcare workers.\nAnd a lot of those unnecessary VA workers y’all just fired were veterans, disabled veterans, and spouses of veterans. Y’all are actively harming the veteran community by firing these folks.\nDoug Collins and the federal government can do all the hand waving and all the complaining they want about the media. I have eyes and ears. I don’t need the media or government officials interpreting reality for me.\nDoug Collins is up here pissing on veterans, and telling us it’s raining outside.\nI find these statements to be very bland and general in nature and appears to be a casual sound bit and a shot at the Fourth estate. The What quality control measures for contract performance were in place when you took office? How much time did you personally spend verifying this before bringing in an outside entity to do this routine job? Why don’t you use your inspector generals to do this task that they routinely do? How many VA employees have been terminated to date to “improve service”? How many of those terminated employees were veterans? This appea\nExcellent information grate to have you on board Honorable Collins.\nGreat report I am a 80% TBI Disabled awarded 100% Unemployability Benefit. USArmy Military Police in the Vietnam Era conflict.\nThis from The American Prospect:\nIf left unchallenged by VA patients and caregivers, veterans’ organizations, and members of Congress, Trump’s appointee will continue to slash and trash services for veterans long after Elon Musk has likely returned to the private sector.\nOn the same day that protesters assembled outside his new office, Collins dismissed 1,000 probationary employees at the VA, while claiming that this move “will not negatively impact VA healthcare, benefits, or beneficiaries.”\nIn a quick rebuttal to Collins, Murray pointed out that those laid off included staffers working on treatments for vets with cancer, respiratory problems, missing limbs, and opioid addiction. “I’m hearing from longtime VA researchers in my home state of Washington who are right now being told to immediately stop their research and pack their bags,” Murray told the press.\nWho got all the money for healthnet in 2017 ?\nWe all know who you really work for, so save the empty promises. Why not be transparent and just tell us when your billionaire business daddies are planning to sell us down the river. I would rather be able to prepare for losing my benefits so I can at least try for a soft landing.\nI hope you have enough of a spine to stand up for us to the Musk/Vance Whitehouse because we will not forget, and we will not forgive.\nYou can talk to me about the weather, which I have no control over, or you could outline the services you’re making available to help me deal with the weather…and yes, part of that is making sure service providers have the support they need to be effective at what they provide. This felt a bit too focused on the weather.\nVery party line here – I take issue to the kids at DOGE having such access without being vetted. I would think that there would be forensic accounting involved – not hackers if the intent were to find waste.\nI’m on the same page as you. Although I don’t take issue with “vetting” per se. I take issue with granting what amounts to top secret clearance to guys with backgrounds that should be disqualifying.\nI mean, take Elon Musk as an example. Soldiers and veterans can lose jobs/clearances for pissing hot, but if you’re rich enough you can do drugs on a podcast and I guess that’s okay.\nMine has been stuck at level 5 since Dec 30th 2024.

There is always room for improvement and the outside eyes of DOGE are probably best suited for determining what is best. What has been televised as cases of waste, fraud and abuse are mind boggling.

He, like virtually every other trump appointee are all going to kiss his a** and sing the praises of Musk.\nI agree!!! 57 days for a primary care visit, unless special circumstances or 100% disabled you can’t even get routine cleaning at dental, specialist without referral is not possible at my VA. Pulmonary only 2 days a week at my VA despite pact act. There is a local clinic that sees no new patients without being on waiting list for year or more. 80 miles one way to VA. Trying my best to move most to community care. Not best choice but 2.7 miles away. Did get Pulmonary care moved to community care. Have had my CT, Pulmonary fitness test and pulmonologist visit all within 10 days versus weeks. Same old story with most people here.\nLast, the question regarding vietnam and agent orange deaths. Here is just my personal story. Raised in town of less than 1000 people. Tons of fathers were WWII vets so lots of us went. 5 died in country, 7 more since of AO exposure have died. I have severe COPD, one of friends severe Parkinson, 2 more with kids born with spidabifada (sp). Same with every small town around me. Until PACT VA flat didn’t acknowledge. It’s going to get worse. I’m 75. Like the vets before us most vietnam vets dying quickly. Damn shame I believed the promise of health care for life when enlisting.\nUnfortunately, my comfort level is not very high.\nI would at least hope for status quo at a MINIMUM.\nAnother LIE from the trump musk regime!\nI would like to see spouses having CHAMPVA able to be treated at VA clinics. They are lifeline of assisting their disabled spouses.\nAs a DAV Chapter Service Officer I am very pleased that you have not hesitated for a moment to set the record straight. I have already heard from veterans that are concerned about their disability claims and THANK YOU for getting in front of the issue. ANYTHING that you can do to assuage their concerns by using every means possible to communicate with them is appreciated.\nI’ve had very little problem with the Va. they have helped me get my health back. I have talked with many other veterans and they seem to appreciate the va’s help. I don’t know what I was doing without those doctors and nurses. I believe Trump will do a great job for all of us.\nTim I am with you 100% on that. I am a combat vet . 100% disabled and have had and having outstanding care through though the VA. A lot of the post here just sounds like Dem. talking points. I remember a President in the not to distant past, that said, let the injured Vet pay for his own care, after all he volunteered for it.\nI don’t believe Mr. Collins has a clue. Anyone who praises Trump, says he’s doing a wonderful job, and DOGE is doing a great job, does not live in the real world. He is a Trump ass kisser. Laying off people who provide help and support to veterans is not a sign of waste, but is a way to discard veteran’s needs. Being on the job for one week and making the comments he did doesn’t instill my faith in him.\nThank You Doug! Please keep us informed. Looking for wonderful things for our Veterans , spouses, widows/widowers, families! We need to know that our President Donald Trump and you have got our backs.\nNo they don’t have our backs, they’re kicking our -ss.\nLOL . . . they “have your backs” alright because that is where they are going to stick the knife.\nI need very little care from the VA. I am very satisfied with the care I have received for 50 + years. I very happy with the changes which have occured over recent years. I know and it is a matter of common sense that people are proned to take advantage of any system. Vets and non Vets alike. I am glad this sort of thing is being vigorously addressed because the ones who do need it most suffer. Thank you, Mr. Collins\nI HAVE HEARING AIDS FROM THE VA I USED TO GET THEM SERVICED AFEW BLOCKED FROM MY HOME\nNOW THE VA WANTS ME TO DRIVE 75 MILES TO LEBNON TO GET SERVICE.

We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nTime will tell the tale.\nRead comments, lot of bitter vets. I am a disable vet. I will not jut anyone on 14 days on the job. When my check gets cut or I cannot visit the VA clinic the I will beleive the media. DOGE is trying to cut waste and abuse I don’t care how old they are just find it, $600 million for sushi . Every president since Regan has promised to cut the budget finally someone is doing it and we are bitching. Only Hon Discharged Vets, disabled or abled, should work in the VA!\nI beg you all to research the nonsense you see on Facebook and Fox news, which you then repeat as fact. I recommend politifact, which is non-partisan. Elon Musk never said that he found $600 mil spent on sushi (https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/06/facebook-posts/no-fishy-food-bill-elon-musk-didnt-say-pentagon-sp/). Don’t get me wrong. I am NOT a Trump fan. I do not believe that Secretary Collins is being truthful. DOGE is a train wreck being used to hurt hard-working Americans while lining the pockets of million/billionaires. I do NOT think Elon Musk, has any business in our government. But, you’ve GOT to stop gobbling up the nonsense from FB and Fox and regurgitating it.\nHe’s lying like the rest of the unqualified people Trump has infiltrated our country with.\nThe Congressional Budget Office recommended ending TDIU benefits for those 67 and older. This is a joke, as Social Security benefits are continually being reduced and it is meant to be a supplement to retirement, not a retirement. In addition, TDIU Veterans do not receive retirement plans like they would if they could hold a job, so they likely would not be able to live on Social Security alone. Someone needs to fight on these issues.\nAlso, I attempted to add my 18 year old daughter in August when she enrolled in college, so she could use her DEA benefits. It’s been six months, and despite having all the necessary paperwork, it hasn’t moved passed initial review. I contacted the White House Hotline and requested assistance. The response I received from the Regional Office was “wait your turn in line.” Six months to add one dependent is absurd.\nLet’s talk about the 2017 Mission Act\nReferring to Mr Thomas Lee your remarks\nSound like the cry babies protesting about our commander and chief that’s finally draining t he swamp\nAs a 90+ YO Korean Vet. I’m sick of the bitching and bellyaching from the cry babies who think Biden did the American Veterans a great service. How did he handle the withdrawal from Afghanistan? My take is that that after visiting a Naval Air Station that celebrates gay and lesbian behavior with signs that they should be proud of their degenerate behavior. What is this costing us veteran in lost funds and access to healthcare? Get educated and thank God we have a chance to turn this country around. Don’t give up and KEEP FIGHTING.\nLet’s talk about the failure of Healthnet 2017\nExcelente News Sir. I’ve trying to get and increase in my disability % over 20 years (imagine it) and nothing has happened. This time I had to hire a lawyers so he can help me with this issue he charges 33.3% of what ever I get… if i get it. My health issues have increased since then; i don’t what to do anymore.\nI have received excellent care at the Tucson VA for over 20 years, and would not like to see their ability to care for veterans in a professional, timely (yes, timely), and caring manner impeded. So far, what the “lying” press has published about the manner in which Trump and Musk have handled the so-called elimination of fraud and waste – without having a clue as to what has actually been taking place, or delving into the ramifications of knee jerk reactions to their “revelations,” seems spot-on. Good luck on seeing the ongoing chaos bringing and semblance of positive results and improving the operations of the government.\nWe still have low information voter’s. As you can see by their comments. They have TDS and there is no treatment or cure. They don’t remember when the lines were so long and TRUMP pushed thru the community care program.\nIt’s only a month. Take your meds and give it time. Make common sense suggestions and not bully / attack the ones trying to get their heads around this mess, it’s been going on for ages. Give it time.\nP.S. there are several people who just walk around the VA appearing not to have a purpose. Veteran, nurse or whatever : they need terminated.\nThere should be more cameras on records actions of veterans and the staff at the counters for appointments and greetings. People on both sides are unkind. There needs to be accountability.\nWe veterans have been pushed against thru the system and had such a hard time getting even our records. Be specific about issues!\nDon’t be pricks!\nClueless. Look around. Research. Even Google. Shame.\nWow, did you drink the orange kool-aid! Poor fool,\nThey fired and investigated the DEI consultants’ spending and found that they were spending 8 million dollars a year on DEI programs when some VA hospitals don’t have full staffing for medical teams. Talk about crossed priorities. When there are hospitals so undermanned that they can only provide limited service, that isn’t the time to be picky about the diversity of its potential hires.\nYou’re so clouded by their constant stream of bs that you can’t see the forest for the trees. Musk will cut whatever he wants because your guy Trump has no spine. He backed down to Putin just like we all knew he would, and he put unqualified, traitorous morons in positions they don’t even understand.\nYou really cannot choose a provider through community care. For primary care, I found myself in a waiting room with immigrants who are on the public dole. I don’t know if providers are chosen by bids submitted, but don’t be surprised over where you end up. The doctor, by the way, mumbled to herself never having seen such “clean” urine, as she was looking over the results.\nI would like to believe that he is being truthful and above board about VA benefits not being targeted for cuts, but the American people were told the same thing about Medicaid and now it’s on the chopping block. So I’m going to have to wait and see while reserving judgement because this administration has burned us before.\nWe need your protection as our current president call us suckers. We never forget. DOGE is political bullsh-t getting rid of the IG;s can only lead to corruption.\nPlease find a way in your heart to continue being a peacekeeper and not perpetuate propaganda. Let’s help this administration make America a better place. There is so much work to be done.\nPlease find a way in your heart to wake up Tamara. Have you not been paying attention to what’s going on in the government offices since Trump Took office? Mr. Trump has never had anything good to say about veterans and has called us idiots for serving our country. What branch of service did you serve in, Tamara? The truth is out there, take off your blinders, open your eyes, and get your fingers out of your ears, please.\nIt’s an insult to think THIS administration has Americas best interest at heart. When it’s his only self serving whims that DOUG and little donnie care about.\nYour newsletter is N- propaganda. U.S. veterans know how to treat N-s. Fck you.\nBS trump is screwing Veterans.\nI read most of the comments and was not surprised at what I saw. Some never addressed his video most were very bitter vets, understandable as I am a disable vet, but I can’t take it out on a man that has been on the job 14 days. This man was in HOR and before I start throwing stones at him I am going to give him a chance and see what he does. I will get it out of the way so no one has to guess, I voted for Trump and would do it again given the alternative. I find it interesting that people are worried about their personal info, your info is all over the place now. They know when you go to the bathroom! As for DOGE we will find out but they really don’t care who Richard is what they want to know is Richard ripping off and or scaming the american people. Reality is,read you own notes, Collins can do no worse than any of his predecessor. The only advice I would give Sec Collins is that he ONLY hire QUALIFIED VETERANS to work in the VA. There are plenty out there that are disable but want to work. Still plenty others that want to work. Some work in government right now that may be let go look to the VA if you are a Hon Disharged Vet. Think don’t cry!\nThank you Richard!\nDawn Nance\nArmy 1978-1981\nThank You Mr Collins I’ve been with the VA for about 50 yrs . VA has always treated me with the utmost respect and fairness . The hospitals I have been in gave excellent care . It makes me very proud to say I am a United States Veteran . Thank You Timothy Foley\nThe operative questions just who is to determine “What’s not needed”- some 19 year old kid who never served a day in the Military??\nwow there are a lot of negative comments on here , much like the old bots on twitter , I wonder if the same concerned people had any negative comments about the feckless D.E.I. hires from the last four years? My personal VA treatment is excellent, I hope this success reaches all vets that need it.\nSo true. Those that are in our right mind, appreciates common sense thinking.\nDOGE is conducting an illegal heist of our personal data, and by allowing these uncleared, unvetted, unqualified criminal vermin to access our personal data you are an accomplice to innumerable Federal felonies. Resign.\nSir,\nIf I recall, the young rascals working for Musk at DOGE came from Space Ex with much higher clearances and IQ’s than respondents in this column. WE HAD TO WAIT FOUR YEARS to find out what Biden had been up to, how about we give Trump and Musk four months?\nYou are so right and don’t think these kids aren’t going to sell your info to the highest bidder some where down the line when Musk is done with them. Follow the money……always sound advice!!!!\nComplaining about the President is not helpful. Mr. Collins needs your issues and your recommended solutions, not a diatribe of your feelings to make you feel better. The VA has lots of problems but if you are not going to help solve them them you’re the problem. – 34 year Marine vet.\nYour words are well spoken, Marine.\nWe’re not paid to solve them, but nice try passing blame to the disgusted vets that are commenting here. Take your trash to FB or X.\nI have a serious concern when the current Trump VA fired so many veterans whom were fired without notice and now become jobless. This is not respect. In my life I have never used any VA services and only I have asked for assistance to change mistakes make on my DD-214 and NOTHING has been done in the last three years. Nothing!! I am 77 years old and I served during the Vietnam war era. So as a Native American I am still strong, health and waiting for VA response and results on my DD-214. As old as I am I need the corrected document to apply for a bank loan. Thank you and may peace prevail and the saying goes “United we stand divided we fall.”\nHang in there Doug! Just ignore the comments from the ppl terminally infected with TDS. Their disease blinds them to the positive realities Trump is bring back to our country and repairing the damage done by 4 years of a dementia ridden DEMOCRAT being in office. Refreshing to see someone with testicles putting a stop to DEI, drag story hours, illegal immigration, weaponization of DOJ, etc, etc, and on and on. The LUNATIC LEFT is finally being put in check. Absolutely amazing how many ppl are blowing snot about DOGE saving BILLIONS of dollars of OUR tax money!\nWell said!\nHe is ignoring them. Have you seen any replies? Dougie boy is laughing all the way to the bank.\nChaplain Collins, please remember…God is watching you. Something you seem to have forgotten or chosen to selectively ignore thus far in your political career. A large number of your words, actions, attitudes, etc leading up to now don’t really peacefully coexist with His word and He will judge you. Simply a friendly reminder for you to maybe do some self-reflection and prayer. Which holds primacy for you…God or “politics”? Have a blessed day!\nI hope this is all true, as a VET who has just got qualified to be on the VA health system I am looking forward to using the VA health care system to help reduce my cost of health care and provide quality health care for me as a Vet. of the Viet Nam Era. As a new enrollee I will need to learn how to best use the VA system that will benefit my health care and cost there of.\nSecretary Collins: Thank you for your continued service in this important position. Our active duty military needs to be the most efficient , lethal fighting force on planet earth and space. And when their active duty time is complete as mine is , the men and woman need to transition into a well run VA and insure the injuries they have sustained are properly treated. God Bless you in this effort.\nJames Carter (USN 1974-1981)\nhear, here! Let us just thank god that time exists. This guy will go the way of all and we will recover. have faith that another day will come and we will prevail. It’ll only be two years until it all ends and we can make things right. Vote in mid-term elections in order to make this joker a lame duck president, as Milania already knows him to be: limp.\nI don’t believe a word any Trump appointee says. They are all liars and cheats, and only out for the bucks.\nThis tells me you believe everything that the media tells you and the Democrats tell you. Grow up and smell the coffee our government is no different than the corrupt governments in other countries and this current administration is pointing this out that some federal employees are corrupt some of our politicians are corrupt and taking the hard earned money that should be going to people that need it like disabled veterans. Instead of wasting it on people that have been dead for 150years. Just look at where Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security have been giving payments to people that have been dead in the millions of dollars that have been sent to whoever that should’ve been going to people that really need it and those of us that are getting close to retirement age. The system is going to be bankrupt because wasteful spending of money the people that are dead and the fact the new generation of Young adults are not having children to be brought into this mess of the medias that lies. My wife left the media in 2003 when Robert Murdoch walked into her office and told her to get rid of the accurate information of who, what, where, when, why and to credible sources willing to go on the record with their names in face to be published. It was all about getting the story out no matter how inaccurate it was to pay her salary she immediately quit. This anonymous source bull***** needs to go..\nIf you look at the people that are yelling the loudest they’re the ones with their hands in the cookie jar taking the money from the disabled veterans and people that need it truly in this country….\ntrump and musk are the loudest in the country\nPossibly of dental care ?\nI have 2 complaints One I called for meds and after waiting one week I called back was told they would order my meds, waited another week to finally receive my medication. I was with out my medication for 3 weeks, second I had an appointment at the Nashville VA. I put in for my travel and was only given a partial. The reason was stated I could have gone to a closer facility. I do not make this appointment the VA does and It was my cardiologist,??????\nThat is a prime example of what goes on everywhere. Thank you for commenting.\nHi, George, thanks for letting us know. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nI’m really surprised that a former military member would act in such a childish way in a forum that asked for comments, feedback, and opinions. What I’ve read is really embarrassing to even be in the same ranks as some of you people. Practice your writing skills and come across like a professional that hopefully you once were when serving. In order to balance the budget everybody needs to suck it up and expect cuts in every department of the federal government.\nApparently you think Trump is a honest person who respects women and people in general; and what did he say about soldiers and veterans ( we are dumb and stupid). So far the appointees to these cabinet positions are unqualified and uninformed in the organizations and departments they are now running. Of course he wants you to tell him what to do, he doesn’t have a clue. The current actions of this administration are not thoughtful, informed actions. Its the opposite and I quote, “we will drive them out of government service” that’s not the “will of the People”.\nActually it was suckers and losers.\nThis is your opinion, same as the rest of the posts.\nThe Vietnam war will of been over 50 years this coming May. My records have been scrubbed along with thousands of brothers with classified operations. I first started having “Agent Orange” in 1994. 6 bouts of cancer later, I still can’t get benefits. Is there going to be another delay of the Army releasing Vietnam classified service records. Please remember, Us of the classified operations. We are the “Sprayed and Betrayed” but each one of us would go back in if our nation needed us.\nI have great faith that Trump and his rookie Collins are planning BIG cuts to Veterans benefits and services!\nConcerns are being raised regarding the potential impact of new VA Secretary Collins on veterans’ benefits and services. The new secretary’s background and political affiliations are drawing scrutiny, particularly in light of potential budget constraints and policy changes within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, described as a staunch supporter of former President Trump, has previously expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, raising questions about his approach to healthcare for veterans. Furthermore, his past involvement in contesting the 2020 election results has led some to question his commitment to upholding democratic principles and the interests of all veterans.\nIn this video, Collins said he had been there only a week and there was already a problem (rite!) and then said not to listen to the media just to trust him bro. Some find his statements uneducated and unprofessional. Collins also rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.\nIn December 2020, Collins was one of 126 Republicans who contested the results of the 2020 presidential election. This action has been criticized as a dishonor to the House and a failure to uphold their oath to support the Constitution.\nWhile Collins has stated his commitment to serving veterans, his initial remarks have been met with skepticism by some, who are concerned that potential cuts to benefits and services may be on the horizon. Veterans and advocates are closely monitoring the situation, seeking clarity on the future direction of the VA under his leadership. Collins is the author of The Clock and the Calendar: A Front-Row Look at the Democrats’ Obsession with Donald Trump, published November 2021.” Not a good or popular book….\nIt is important for veterans to stay informed and engage with their elected officials to ensure their voices are heard as these changes unfold.\nMJ, 2nd Ranger Bat\nI support president Trump 100% Keep up the good work rhat you and your team is doing!\nFrom a vietnam veteran ??\nPeople are focused on the wrong thing of course thanks to media. I trust Doge to cut waste like they are everywhere else. What I’m concerned about is the proposed budget cuts recommendations written before the Trump administration that came out of the Congressional Budget office for 2025 to 2034 as a budget defeceit recommendation that would affect veteran benefits.\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-12/60557-budget-options.pdf?fbclid=IwY2xjawIkR6dleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHRH3c9KA4ojmwI3goVoZoj1NJUw5bnKSWzbsJu_WYJvP5_M1kyQSmSWHlw_aem_AOyjVclZFk48KhugaNMtQQ\nWith regards to DOGE and the benefits situation. There is a report that both the 30% rate is getting cut from compensation and that Unemployability is being taken out as a program moniker for the 100 % IU. What’s the truth, just what is the truth about the cuts announced in MilitaryNews.com. You’re praising DOGE as a watchdog group of sorts who are sorting through the contracts. A group of 20-something engineer grads are able to do accounting? Please.\nSecretary Collins, thank you for your service.\nI suggest a examining the connections between exposures to jet fuels that contain neurotoxins and cesium additives in JP-7 to the increase rates of advanced prostrate cancer.\nMany of us were unknowingly exposed to these toxins since they were classified top secret in years past. Anyone working around these aircraft were exposed because the aircraft did not have sealed fuel tanks and without being provided protective equipment due to the fact the additives were top secret during a special access / need to know program. We were exposed directly to the fuels and aspirated the fumes and burning exhaust of these fuels and ionized additives.\nWithout knowing of the hazards, we had to bring our fuel soaked uniforms home to be washed which cross contaminated our homes and further exposed our family members.\nCan we get some of the Doge money found to pay for dental work for vets. Our teeth take the brunt of all issues. PTSD sufferers grind our teeth, when we are sleeping, angry or just plain trying to figure out something.\nI have great hopes for what you will be doing for the Vets\nRE ptsd and teeth grinding. My dentist had a really thin tooth guard made I wear every night. Its actually helped me to stop grinding as much somehow (and it protects my teeth). If I stop wearing it I clench and grind again. Its worth trying one.\n60 day waits for Primary Care appointments are Unacceptable. It was less than 10 days till Republican s started chopping funding needs. Staffing and morale are at all time lows under Trump, are YOU going to stand up to Trump for Veteran needs or just cow down like the rest?\nBut it is in the Heritage Foundations budget proposal for 2023 amount things that Trump is currently actin upon. https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/policy-proposals.html\nStop blaming the “media” for when you say you’re doing “this” and then you do “that”. And Strump doesn’t know what he is doing anyway.\nRite brother\nAbsolutely! Truth!\nPlease keep politics out of Veterans Affairs. All you needed to say was you’re not cutting benefits. And then keep your word.\nThe funding comes from the Federal Government. Which is political.\nI totally agree to keep politics out of this. It’s a travesty he even brought this up. Focus only what you’re doing, not on a political leader’s policy you do or don’t support\nYeah, I caught that too. Once he said, “under Trump’s leadership,” he gave himself away.\nDon’t trust a thing that this administration says or does. Hope I’m wrong but so far there is no evidence to that.\nVery pleased and relieved our benefits are not going to be cut !! I had 11 hours a week for home health, which was not enough. You cut my hours back to 9 hours per week, which is terrible. I am wheel chair bound and have only my 85 year wife to help me the rest of the time. We get nothing but run around from the VA about who to talk to about more hours. The VA sends us to the VA advocate who sends us back to the VA primary Dr. (which they can’t keep) We have a beautiful new VA clinic here ,but it is not fully staffed. Sure wished we had the right person to talk to.\nThis outcome is exactly what should occur. I have attempted to explain this to others, but fearmongers prevent them from listening.\nMr. Collins, do you serve the veterans of the United States military and their families first or do you serve recently self-appointed king first?\nStop the Co-pay requirements for Vets Medical, doctor visits, and drugs!\nSir, you may believe what you stated (at least when this was recorded by you). However, Musk and Trump’s words and actions (including cuts of crisis staff and access to veterans’ personal dada) do not jive with your statements.\nthe va does everything to hinder old vets.I used to get online with the VA clinic in Niagara Falls ny..now I`m so confused with the changes .I can`t just get to my local va clinic anymore..Good going VA you made it hard for old vets\nSince you’ve only been there a week, I’m assuming you are a trump appointee. All trump and musk do is lie lie lie. How do we know if you are telling the truth. Nothing they have done is even legal. There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nI am assuming you are a Democrat….. all you/they do is lie, lie, lie. Go see a doctor for your chronic TDS!\nObviously, you thought Biden did a good job which means your opinion is moot.. The days of the Biden crime family is over with Their just auditing the government which is long overdue Relax and watch your country get saved.\nI agree. Dental Benefits would be so helpful. I need over 10K in dental care. The dental insurance offered is not economically or practically viable. It takes 6 months of pay in before benefits can be used, it has high deductible and co pays, it limits care per year such that it would cost at least as much if not more. It would delay and stretch out care beyond what is medically advisable. I now have problems with my jaw, TMJ. I think they call it (likely the result of arthritis in the jaw), but cannot get care without my teeth being fixed first. Like fellow veteran Tyrone Burns, I also need extractions and dentures. If expanding benefits is true, not just spin, please consider dental care for all veterans.\nI don’t have the same faith in Doge as Sec Collins has as it relates to cuts. So far they (Doge) are not attempting to gain procedural knowledge of any organization before making cuts. I agree waste should be eliminated, but done so intelligently.\nHow Many Nurses Have Been Fired At the VA?\nWhy Did Trump Say He Is The King?\nOkay. I’ll believe that the benefits won’t get chopped. However, I still don’t like, and don’t trust those tech guys at DOGE who have access to personal information, be it mine or other veterans like myself. And I especially don’t trust Musk. He and those tech guys that work for him know nothing about doing any kind of audit. He has another agenda which involves making him rich(er). He is also in league with AFD (Alternative for Deutchland). In other words, he is in league with white supremacists, or he is one himself, which to me, means ha cannot be trusted.\nHow many Doctors have Been Fired at the VA?\nGet rid of DOGE and Musk!!!!!\nHow Many Vietnam Veterans Died From Agent Orange?\nHow Many Veterans Have Been Fired?\nId like to know how many commissioners took the buy out, quit, or got fired. Im still waiting for my HLR to be seen, 3 duty to assist errors going back to 08.. lets git r done\nDental help would be nice for all vets.\nWhy Are Veterans being Fired?\nThank you for fighting for us! Keep up the good work and may God be with you in this struggle to take care of those of us who stepped up to serve this great nation!\nLet’s see, my physical therapist ran by MyMichigan Health care (a Community Care referral) after a year and a half of therapy, recommended an exercise bike to help with my service connected disability and from a failed surgery to my neck that left me extremely weak on my left side and wheelchair bound. My PCP also submitted a referral for the equipment. It was DENIED bymy VAMC Prostetics Department. I appealed and after 2 years, I gave up and bought my own. No reimbursement for the equipment. Next, I am wheelchair bound, I have tried to get a chairglide put into my entertainment area of my house, I was issued 2 in Colorado. They sit in my garage currently and all they need is to be installed. The VA here installed a new one going to my bedroom but says they can’t install the ones I have that were issued by the VA to the entertainment area of my house because they can only issue 1. So I have these two sitting in my garage now and can’t afford to pay myself to get one installed to the entertainment area (basement). A quote to install is roughly $1,600. Again, being wheelchair bound, I have carpet in my home, and I’ve been trying to get help (2 times DENIED SHA/SAH) with the removal of it so my wheelchair is easier to navigate in my house. I was offered the $6k HISSA (sp) grant, but when I got a quote to remove the Carpet and replace with hardwood or similar, the quotes were at the lowest $24K and that was just the hallways, living room and my bedroom. I keep getting letters and emails about all the wonderful benefits that await Veterans in my situation, but when you apply for the benefits, like with the exercise equipment, flooring and chairglide installlation, you either Beg the VA until you give up and buy yourself or do without because this just seems like the old “bait and switch” game. Yes, I am 100% (Actually combined 750%) disabled per the rating scale. I only get paid for 1-100%, I took a 50% cut in pay from what my job paid me annually to accept the VA’s 1-100% rating because I was declared unemployable due to PTSD, TBI, White Matter Disease, Meniere’s, Depressive Disorder and sedentary lifestyle brought along with it DMII, OSA and heart problems which have required 3-stents.. If you mean what you say, why are us Veterans being put through the vigerous hoops? I am glad you are cutting back on the unnecessary cost to run the VA. I just hope the differences are returned to the Veterans as you say because as I described above, it has been really challenging to get the benefits I need and in the begging process have had to reach out to my Patient Advocate (which is a joke), my Congressman on two occasions, OIG on two occasions and am about to reach out to them again because service connection hasn’t been awarded for 6-post-op secondary disabilities that weren’t present before the surgery and didn’t start with treatment/medication until after my condition begain deterriorating Post-op! I am only 1 example as I am sure many others have experienced my plight first hand. We just feel at the mercy of the VA when we are confined like I am and rely solely on the VA and I’ll tell you personally, it is a daily, stressful experience which no doubt will lead to further decline based solely on the stress and depression I stay in.\nLYING SACK OF SH-T!!! Fire our hospital staff,REMOVE benefit at 65 no MONEY F-CKED on Medicare!! F-CK YOU TRUMPF SUCKING TRAITOR!\nLOL, the VA can help with that anger management but your TDS is terminal.\nLeave Terry alone. This is not funny.\nT rump is a fraud and so are his programs. All you are doing is dismantling the government to give muskrat and his friends more freedom to rob us. The day when we get tired of this is coming and you need to think about where you stand (hint, long term vision is better than short term).\nI think the administration is doing exactly what we voted for.\nYou have my support. 100% service related, Vietnam\nThat’s a bunch of crap! He is in Trump and Musk’s pocket\nWhat about the1,000 VA support personnel that are being cut? How will that affect our medical benefits?\nJames H. Donahue\nCAPT, USCG (ret.)\nit would be nice to see full Dental Benefits for all veterans , not just retired!!! Dental health is probably more important than anything as far as sickness goes. not having to rely on anti-biotics and painkillers because of improper oral hygiene would be a great plus for our overall health. i could use dentures or implants and a few more extractions to get healthier and an improved digestive system because of being able to chew food properly!!\nSecretary Doug Collins keep protecting Veterans benefits. Even my family says President Trump is going to cut your disability benefits. I say no they aren’t going to be cut. Secretary Collins keep up the good work. Lets take the money for luxury hotels for illegal aliens and take care of homeless veterans. George Miller Vietnam Veteran.\nMy 76 year old Viet Nam veteran husband called the VA yesterday (02/19/2025) for an appointment with his primary care physician and the earliest appointment he can get is for 08/01/2025!! AND the VA Eye Clinic is closed and not taking appointments at this time…..if this guy is trying to tell you that things are fine at the VA and deserving veterans are getting efficient and quality care, he is dead wrong and many of these veterans will be also with this type of care provided to them!!\nMa’am, this exact reason you explained above, is why Community Care exists. I couldn’t get an eye exam either, so I received a referral to get one at a civilian clinic. Just ask for the referral, and if the VA tries to give you a hard time, stand your ground. Also, if your husband cannot get an appointment in a reasonable amount of time with his PCP, again, have his PCP get a referral for your husband to see a physician in the community. This is what community care is for.\nHi, Donna, we’re sorry to hear about your husband’s experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nIt is sad to see that a Christian Chaplin would align himself with the likes of trump. When you earned your master’s degree in divinity from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary you must have missed the day they taught Matthew 4:8-9. Because when trump offered “All these things I will give you” You choose to fall down and worship him (trump).\n“Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.”\nI would love to be there on your judgement day and see you explain that decision you made to God.\nYou really should keep your political thoughts/feelings to yourself. “We the People” elected President Trump and he is doing “EXACTLY” what we asked him to do, like putting Doug Collins in as Sec of the Veterans Administration.\nsuck, suck, suck….taste good??\nIf there was a rumor going around my units that we were going to deploy, we deployed. I don’t know about everyone else, I just know what I know. Why would Veterans, Retirees and VA workers be on pins and needles for no reason. What about the “Women Clinics” closing due to DEI? Just our imagination? I’m going to wait and watch.\nIn fact doge is just a front for a fraudulent scheme and have illegally entered the government IT systems.\nA whole lot of worrying over nothing IMHO. DOGE, Musk and Trump do NOT want your money. They are not there copying all your info down (sheesh), ANYTHING to do with the VA is safe…including spouse stuff, etc. CALM down folks. STOP believing the lies.\nAnd to Richard L. That free time you speak of is due to your king sir..\nEither you are the VA website is a Liar ! The web page for Veterans announced at least 1000 people have Now Lost their Jobs but You sir Claimed No CUT BACKS have occurred!\nThank you so much. I am very apprciative of the work that DOGE is doing. It’s also reassuring to know that our benefits will be secure. Thank you, sir.\nI appreciated the video because it introduced me to the new Secretary. I appreciated Secretary Collins communicating his enthusiasm to take charge of the VA and his desire to allay the concerns of some Veterans. These concerns have been created because they have been duped in to believing what they read in newsprint and see on TV. It’s a significant challenge to educate them and build a confidence in the VA so they can know that the VA is getting its stuff together and can effectively help them get the help they need. Maintain the attack! VR–Leland Klein\nDear Mr. Secretary, how about dumping some of the crazy policies put in place last year under the previous administration, like child-proof hearing aid batteries! Sounds smart, but they’re Veteran Proof too!? Once opened, the VA provides pouches to store them in (not child-proof for sure! So, it makes it easier for a child to ingest a bunch of batteries, instead of one at a time! Please fix this & take a look at other things we deal with daily. You are much appreciated & I so appreciate you reaching out with the truth!\nHow can we trust that benefits will not be cut when DOGE shut down entire agencies without any evaluation of programs and mass firing without any justification, explaination or accountability? Yes, eliminating personnel reduces cost but has nothing to do with fraud, waste or abuse.\nI’m glad to hear that at least one part of the government isn’t being destroyed.\nSorry sir but the lies that have come out from the Republican administration do not give me comfort that your statement is truthful.\nDear Secretary McDonough,\nI am writing to bring to your immediate attention the unacceptable conditions at the Little Rock VA Medical Center. As someone who deeply values the well-being of our veterans, I am disturbed by the state of this facility and the substandard level of care being provided to those who have served our country.\nDuring recent visits, I have witnessed and received reports of the following issues:\nUnsanitary conditions, including dirty patient rooms, inadequate cleaning, and persistent maintenance problems.\nLong wait times for medical appointments and procedures, resulting in delayed treatment and worsening health conditions.\nStaffing shortages, leading to overworked healthcare providers and inadequate attention to patients.\nPoor facility conditions, including outdated equipment, broken infrastructure, and a general lack of upkeep.\nOur veterans deserve the highest standard of care, yet the conditions at this VA hospital suggest a failure to meet even basic medical and sanitary standards. I urge your office to take immediate action to investigate these concerns and implement necessary improvements.\nI respectfully request a formal response outlining what steps the VA will take to address these issues and ensure our veterans receive the dignified care they have earned. I am also willing to discuss this matter further and provide additional details as needed.\nThank you for your time and commitment to our nation’s veterans. I look forward to your prompt attention to this urgent matter..\nHi, Charles. Sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThe truth and nothing but the truth with our Veterans, Thank you Doug Collins for being transparent with the lying media(Cnn,Msnbc,etc..)\nAmen to that\nTo see so many veterans, who are helping other veterans, be fired from the VA (especially those helping prevent suicide) is disgraceful. To see our country’s leaders spewing lies and abandoning our allies makes me sick. I joined the Cold War Army and served 32 years, and never thought to see us capitulate to despots and believe their lies and propaganda.\nIndividual ratings equal 120 % , yet my overall VA rating is 80%. Cannot work due to TBI, PTSD issues yet the VA cannot see unemployable as they themselves won’t hire me.\nDont give up… They (current administration) want you to, and are likely going to try to change the way the Disability Ratings are Calculated and Evaluated to reduce them and “Save Money”. 2016- 2020 was a awful period to try to get a fair disability review done.\nHave you gone through the VSO in your county or the VFW? Don’t go through the VA yourself when trying to get benefits. A VSO in your county is the best thing you can do to receive benefits owed.\nWhy are you allowing a non-appointed civilian into the VA at all and allowing the minions to look around at our personal information. President Elon Musk should not be allowed through the doors of the VA. He is an immigrant and does not have the authority to be in Federal Buildings without an escort of some kind and to think that you or anyone would allow a group of teenagers and 20 somethings with computers into the building and snoop through personal records is shameful. Resist the ELON.\nI sure need to get my widows benefits…my husband Wayne Mosby passed away 09/06/2023. I would appreciate your help. Thank You\nThe questions is: Are our benefits going to be taken away in accordance with the Project 2025 guidance related to VA?? recommend reading it…\nThank you Secretary Collins for the video.\nI appreciate you clearing up some of the liberal media lies.\nThank you for working so hard to protect our Veteran benefits.\nBTW, The President’s Executive orders have not trickled down to all VA facilities yet.\nI still see VA employees using gender pronouns and LGBTQ flags at VA clinics.\nAs a Veteran and VA employee, I truly appreciate all the hard work this administration is doing to protect and defend the rights of conservative Americans that solely seek to follow Biblical Beliefs, God’s beliefs.\nAgain, many thanks\nIt is a matter of trust. Doug you took the first step in gaining my trust. I look forward to hearing from you in the future.\nDear Honorable Sec, V. A., Doug Collins,\nAnother Combat Wounded Veteran (CWV), has died today. Some CWV’s will die, as a cause of caustic or failed V.A. Medical Services. Some CWV’s, will fall prey to SUICIDE, (due to the same reason cited in the previous sentence), “ADDED,”‘ by THE IMPACT of the voluminous FLAWS, FAILURES, DEVASTATIONS, DISRUPTIONS, HORRIBLE DISASTERS, INSULTS, and THREATS, to We the People, and especially to we military veterans, that was willfully created by the EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, & ADMINISTRATION OFFICES-circa 2021-2024. Most of which was to repeat, and employ the antagonistic mantra of the “EXECUTIVE OFFICE-circa 2009-2016, TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE AMERICA, from being OUR REPUBLIC, to a DESTRUCTIVE form of NWO-SOCIALISM.”\nThis depressed and overly stressed 80 y/o CWV (Vietnam 01/31/1968-@0200- TET’SURVIVER.), understands the opening paragraph WAS QUITE a RUN-ON SENTENCE…. but just the effort to cite a TRUTH … has given me calm, at least for the present moment. Though it is beyond any shadow of a doubt, that this CWV, has been the recipient of several VERY EGREDIOUS V. A. MEDICAL Services over the years, since I retied, relating to my never ending depression, dental, headaches, vision, and urinary tract V. A Medical Services, compound errors, that I must endure, as I am privileged, to survive with each new day my Creator THANKFULLY provides. Also with Gods love, mercy, forgiveness, direction and Guidance, to overcome my falling prey to suicide, while enduring so many emotional and destressing hardships, that has befallen on me over the years of writing that check, in Service to my Country.\nDoug Collins, Thank You for your service to Our Country, and I pray GOD SPEED your LEADERSHIP, Counsel, and CONSERNED DIRECTIONS to improve the present, V. A. Medical Services, especially to the many younger Veterans and CWV’s, that they will receive the best , and better, V. A. Medical Services, than was provided to us older CWV’s.\nHang in there young man, we are still above ground and for that we should be thankful. I am also a Vietnam Vet 66-67 SGT USMC with health issues related to my time in Vietnam, specifically tied to Agent Orange and I fight my health issues daily but I am thankful to God for he has kept me going all this time. I only started using the VA two years ago but they have been very helpful since I started using them. Hopefully Sec Collins will make the VA even better. You stay strong young man, you haven’t lived this long just to give up now. Thank you for your service and God Bless You. I will pray for you.\nI think we are going to be hurt financially and you know you are lying to us. Please stop telling people to tell us they thank us for our service this also hurts when it’s spoken with out sincerity\nOur concern is that the VA speeds up the approval for disability applicants\nF-ck your so full of bullsh-t Collins\nSure wish the VA would honor us vets that must keep medicare and supplemental medical insurance coverage. I pay over $450.a month for this as my two agent orange illnesses don’t rank me high enough for any none service related coverage. VA not honoring medicare is just a way for them to get more veteran at very low cost. Link up, please—-!!!\nI would have felt some belief in what you said if you hadn’t mentioned the draft dodging “orange felon” throughout your remarks\nI would like to know how hard are you going to get the Pact Act to cover burn pits for us Vietnam Vets? I would also like to know how hard you are going to push your former Representatives and Senators to pass the language correction initiative to the Pact Act, Section 804 being introduced this week by Representative Murphy and Senator Tillis?\nGreat.Democrat Media lies .\nSecretary Collins,\nAs a 2001 retired navy veteran, I want to thank you for the reassurance regarding veteran benefits.\nI am compelled to express concern on another matter, that being Elon Musk heading up DOGE. I consider it a conflict of interest for him to determine what is efficient use of my tax dollars while according to every source I read states he has to date received $18 billion tax dollars for SpaceX and Tesla.\nCould you look in to this or forward it to the appropriate government department please? Based on the various media sources I have read, it seems 47 (forgive the fact I have so little respect or value for him I refuse to even type his name) and Elon are collaborating on an agenda that is leading our nation to an end for democracy and towards a fascist state.\nThank you for your time and attention.\nIt’s about time that fraud and waste and silly DEI policies are rectified. Clearly instigators have to create false narratives to panic people.\nYou should know veterans fall under DEI as well. Diversity, Equality, Inclusion. That is why places are able to give “points” in the hiring process for Veterans.\nNot convinced. I predict that within six months we’ll see movement toward privatizing veteran’s healthcare or limiting it to combat vets.\nSince this guy is a trump appointee, I don’t believe a word he is saying. You said the magic word privatizing.\nSince you suffer from terminal TDS, I don’t believe a word you are saying. Sit back and immerse yourself in more Rachael Madcow, MSDNC, CNN, etc. Pathetic. Must really suck to have absolutely zero deductive reasoning. Hope you are able to reconnect to reality.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins\nI have listened to what you had to say and if you are truly ready to help Veterans then please contact me via the following email address. This address is one that I rarely use but I do check for answers to questions I submitted to other organizations.\nI am a veteran that has extreme difficulty getting around and I do need Community Care but currently the Northern California Health Care System could care less and in most cases have denied Community Care even though it was approved before. I do have Tri-Care For Life as part of my retirement benefits from the military and I have begun a transition back to Tri-Care to make sure I receive the care I need.\nAugustus, we’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWe were lied to about Vietnam and have been lied to since about defoliants end results. Many of us have AO related problems that VA keeps denying after numerous claims we have put in…backed by DAV…I learned early on to never trust anything the govt. says…and I sure as heck don’t believe anything coming out of the White House, or Congress,anymore.\nWho are the DOGE people reviewing VA contracts and what expertise do they have in federal contract administration.\nWill the VA post the specific contracts being identified by DOGE for elimination or reduction.\nHow many VA personnel (federal employees) has DOGE identified that their positions are being eliminated and what services did these personnel provide.\nYour administration has promised transparency in these actions, and thus far I have seen none. Promises that VA benefits will not be impacted without evidence is poor assurance.\nYour effectiveness as an advocate for veterans is yet to be proven.\nNow let’s see if he means it or if he tells alternative facts/untruths.\nHe is full of sh-t.\nJust wait and see what Bone Spurs does to the VA. Already fired over 1000 workers in a time the VA is understaffed and trying to hire skilled workers. The closest thing that we see to a real Dr is a NP or a PA. And they don’t stay around for long . They are the real benefit we receive but if you can’t hire them or they are fired, we are f-cked. Which we are as of now.\nSo Doug, you just keep spewing the same sh-t that comes out of Bone Spurs and let’s just see how successful you really are.\nSay hello to Elon. That POS.\nPlease Please look into LOWERING COMMISSARY PRICES at Ft Bragg, NC…(other bases too) MANY of the grocery prices are higher than the civilians counterpart grocery stores. THEN on top of grocery prices…we pay an additional “6% building fee” which is a tax no matter what its called. The VA has so much buying power…seems the buying contracts need looking into.. Meat (beef)Prices are especially high.. At Ft Bragg/Camp Mackall we have so many Active duty soldier families & Veterans..there has to be a away to LOWER prices at commissaries across-the-board. Thanks for ALL that you are doing! :)\nJust curious then. If commissary prices are higher than grocery stores, why not go to the grocery stores? That’s what I’ve done whenever I lived near bases. Commissary prices are ALWAYS higher. Also, this man’s job is not in the scope of reducing grocery prices at the commissary. The commissary is under a different department. He’s in charge of the VA. Groceries have increased in all stores, commissary or not.\nI responded to my call of duty in 1967 spent 1 year carrying m60 machine gun in Viet Nam, paid my dues, just like thousands of veterans and a 100 % disabled, no draft dodger and or billionaire should have right to to attack military veterans who provided them the right and freedom they have enjoy today . keep veterans in your mind daily, not these idiots that that want to screw us and never served . Keep in mind veterans are going to stand up and for there right as this administration is mirror Russia more and more on a daily admiring Putin, pardon me if you voted for trump, but this is happing on your watch\nThis video is a shamefully political plug for Trump and DOGE. It begins typically by blaming the media for running with stories that they just aren’t commonly running that benefits will be cut. I read a wide range of mainstream media across the political spectrum on a daily basis and have not encountered a single story about veteran benefits being cut, but Secretary Collins probably found one somewhere. Collins doesn’t cite a single source or example and then builds a cringe-worthy political endorsement on a falsehood. Keep our military apolitical!\nWhat don’t our veterans need? They have sacrificed life and limb to fight our wars! What could possibly be cut back? How much is it going to cost for the cooperation of the VA. I am concerned to say the least.\nI am concerned that they may cut our DIC benefits. My husband did 2 tours in Vietnam, he wasn’t drafted and spent 20 yrs in the USMC and died of Agent Orange.\nTouching our DIC would impact so many families who sacrificed their loved ones.\nYou can cut the two employees that ask the Covid questions at the door of the clinic. There are more screeners than patients. That would save millions.\nNeed to look into the Biloxi/pensacola VA. they do not understand how Community care works! “8 months to get orthotics. Finally after sending an email I had a supervisor repsond and flat out tell me so many employee do not show up for work an when the do they don’t work. This awesome supervisor and transfering beause she can’t take the extra hours doing others work anymore\nHi, David, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThank goodness as my health care needs improved.\nI feel that we have to give up our benefits just to keep Trump happy. That is a no no, we did not volunteer to go to Vietnam in 1966, we were ordered to go and came back not the same. As secretary of Veterans Affairs are you representing the veterans to help them keep their benefits. There is going to be a lot of Veterans in an uproar and Marching on Capitol Hill. Trump can give up part of his pay since he is a veteran. You have veterans that can not work to pay their bills and and other necessities. Veterans work hard and came back injured and now we have a billionaire in white house giving advice to our so called Cammander in Chief , sticking his nose in our benefits we earned, they belong to us the veterans.\nTrump is NOT a veteran. In fact he used connections to dodge Vietnam.\nJust like Clinton avoided military service, just like Bush avoided military service, just like Biden dodged military service, etc, etc. Oh and by the way, President does NOT accept one penny of his salary as President. He donates it. The only president to ever do that.\nWell said!\nHe is also the only president who openly takes bribes – totally corrupt – hence the 34 felony convictions; wastes millions of $$ golfing more days than not, steals from charities, is notorious for never paying his bills, believes he is a king, calls Veterans ‘suckers & losers’, has total disdain for the military, lies about pretty much everything….. but sure, stay in the cult until he throws you under the bus because he will.\nVeteran, well said, Trump is a charlatan idiot and so are all his MAGA followers.\nSOMEONE SHOULD EVALUATE THE HOSPITAL IN DECATUR , GEORGIAN…THE FACILITY IS OLD AND FILTHY…THE TROOPS DESERVE BETTER…..\nThank you, VA Secretary Doug Collins! It is great to hear directly from you about what is the truth. I wish other Secretary’s would do the same. I am a 23 year Navy veteran and was less than a month from being cleared as Program Analyst probationary for the Federal Aviation Administration (Aviation Safety) and was just terminated last Feb 14, 2025.\nI am one of three who review and process the medical exams for the Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) here in the Pacific Northwest (we take care of seven states). Program Analysts along with the Flight Surgeons ensure that our ATC’s are medically qualified and we issue their medical clearances before they can control air traffic. Our job is critical as we protect the “safety of our national airspace”. Our Regional Flight Surgeon along with the Federal Air Surgeon is trying to get me back but they are not making any promises. In my opinion, it is about time that someone look into all the fraud, waste, and abuse in our government.\nPresident Trump and DOGE should have done things differently as far as letting people go. It is a long process to get hired for a federal position and then in a blink of an eye just get terminated. A blank statement of, “DOT FAA finds, that based on your performance you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the DOT FAA would be in the public interest” is totally inaccurate and contradictory to what was submitted to HR, “I certify that the performance, conduct, and general traits of character of this employee have been\nfound satisfactory and recommend that the employee be retained beyond the probationary period.”\nThere are a number of veterans who want to keep serving our government (single parent and those who moved to another state etc.) and at the end of the day, this is the thank you that we deserve? We the People…\nSir, I don’t believe that our VA is being served by the current occupant of Maralago and his henchmen scraping our data, destroying beloved institutions, leaving this once great land into some future serfdom.\nPlease reimplement customer service feedback for each VA encounter so veterans can address issues (good and bad) at the time of occurrence. An advocate should review these feedbacks and address, resolve, or elevate, any issues raised.\nAnd what of survivors benefits?\nSecretary Collins,\nWhile I understand that you are a political appointee, serving the men, women, and family’s of the US military veteran community and the Civil Servants who work for the VA must come first.\nThose members and families are from all walks of life. They come from every Political party. Every State. Every Religion. They may be Gay or straight. They may have voted for Trump. They may have voted for someone else.\nThe one and only thing that should concern you is taking care of them.\nYou talk as if the men and women of your Department are the enemy.\nYou pay homage to President Trump multiple times in this video.\nYou use propaganda and misdirection to avoid having to address and answer real and relevant questions.\nYou try to convince everyone that “The Washington media.” is at fault, that they are manipulating us, and that they are not to be trusted. You are spreading propaganda and stoking the fires of distrust.\n“They take a possibility, and then run with the story.”\nSo using your approach, if the media reported about the four 12 December, 2024 Proposals submitted to the CBO, about reducing, cutting, eliminating, means testing, and taxing our Disability Benefits, you would claim what?\nYou clearly make the claim that they should not report this information as a possibility.\nAnd yet they have been developed, written, and submitted for review to determine how much money could be eliminated from Disability Benefits, in order to fund “OTHER” budgetary priorities, such as pre planned tax cuts. These Tax cuts, as proposed, have been determined to disproportionately benefit the small percentage of U.S citizens in the upper echelons of income.\nBut you say that this “Possibility” should not be disclosed, or shared or reported.\nI find this greatly concerning.\nIn my humble opinion, you are coming across like a used Car Salesman, Yes Man, who lacks the courage and willpower to be anything but a placeholding marionette. Someone else controls the strings and the words that come out of your mouth.\nYou need to be a Leader worthy of the position you hold.\nI’ll believe this when I see it.\nI know for a fact that claims have not been moving faster. With the PACT Act there are more claims needing attention and VA was hiring but on a hiring freeze and looking to terminate those who were hired in the past two years. Stop lying to us..\nOverall my experience in scheduling an appointment has been from 1 to 10, I give it a 6.\nI have used the VA for the last 55 years and always had the same criticism. The telephone answering system where you are transferred from one extension to another showed a lack of caring:\nthe attitude is to transfer the call to someone else where you have to give the same personal information over and over again\nAlso, the specialty clinics are understaffed so the average wait time for an appointment is 3 weeks and up. meanwhile, the person is in pain.\nWell the people who work at the VA are on pins and needles day to day. Did you tell them what you just said in this video? They are waiting for the other shoe to drop. Musk and Trump both want to go after the VA. What about the one thousand people who were already let go?\nI see the hateful boomers are in full swing talking trash about our president. You can clearly see that they have way to much free time to watch cnn or any other main stream media like NPR. You folks need to get outside and pull the talking points that you regurgitate out of your behinds.\nGrow up, you are being spiteful and regurgitating lies.\nStop it.\nFocus on helping veterans and keep your gross political views to yourself.\nSF\nAre you a veteran? Are you concerned about your earned benefits? The current actions being taken by this administration are clearly evident as not in the best interests of the VA employees and the veterans. You better read the Project 2025 chapter on the VA and then wait and see what occurs. We have a right to be concerned about what is happening, Considering the Russian relationship and unqualified individuals being placed in the Cabinet positions. Currently serving Republican Congress are not doing their job, they need to go. The Constitution I swore to defend is under attack.\nyou are disrespectful….\nYou must be disillusioned and not able to think for yourself. Disrespectful is what is happening to our country right now. I am vewry concerned….Illegal access to the Treasury Dept. The firing of a person because they are in a 1 yr prob period. Calling himself “KING”. Individuals in Musks employment being placed in every Department to observe and report on activities. Ignoring the Constitution. Who knows how much of the peoples money DOGE employees will steal from the Treasure. The bottom line here is the VA is important to a lot of people and the benefits matter, so I have issue with ANYBODY trying to reduce them or take them away, You should to, IF you are a veteran.\nI am a Veteran, I am a employee of the Fed Gov, I am a retired Veteran. I am not foolish enough to hope that Trump is going to care about me or any benefits I have earned. I am not lazy, I am not stupid, I have put 40 years of Service into this country. Who are you??\nSecretary Collins,\nI appreciate you sharing this video. In the video, you mentioned there will be no cuts to benefits. So to clear it up for everyone reading the news, these comments, Project 2025, and Agenda 47, I have a few questions.\n1. Will Veterans who are or will be social security retirement age lose any of their service-connected benefits. There are different posts out there that reference portions of Project 2025 that calls for them to be reduced to 30% or lose 30% (go from like 100% to 70%)?\n2. Since DEI is being eliminated in the VA does this mean that women’s clinics and women specific doctors and procedures disappear from the VA Medical Center System?\n3. Will Veterans who receive military retirement and VA disability compensation be put back to a pre-2005 timeframe where you could not draw both at the same time?\n4. Will Veterans who can’t prove their injury was directly related to work while in the military not be afforded service-connected disability anymore?\nThe hypocrisy will kill you!\nSome Trump supporters are actually intelligent people. The problem is years of right wing propaganda have them brainwashed.\nPlease STOP with the political garbage on this site. That’s not what this site is for. I voted for President Trump and I am “NOT” brainwashed.\nMy disabilities total 130% but my benefit payment is 80% due to the VA convoluted combined ratings formula. Also my colon cancer is not an agent orange presumptive despite what the American Cancer Society says. Perhaps the new director could look into these anomalies.\nThe Bill above my comment is a different Bill than me.\nWHY does it take 25 years to get an answer about my claim and you say you are working quick\nI had no doubt that the Trump admin was going to take care of veterans and keep their promises. That phony media machine is incapable of telling the truth. It was under the first Trump admin that I finally got some of my benefits expedited. Everything has been on hold for the last four years and now the needle is moving again. Thank you Mr. Collins.\nShould we join the January 6 “patriots” and surround the DC pig pen and show our disappointment with the Trump musk man love team? Neither one wore fatigues for our great nation which is why they’re tearing it apart. Don’t drink the kool aid!\nNo, this time they wouldn’t label them “patriots.” You’d be thrown in jail as an “insurrectionist” or told to get a job.\nIt’s great that you are addressing concerns of many but don’t tell me that you are above trump/musk in making decisions that may affect many veterans. I wouldn’t believe anything these days because truth and integrity seems to have no place in government.\nWish the VA video was shareable!\nIs any of my personally identifiable information being shared with DOGE personnel? Will it ever be unsecured?\nThank you so much Secretary Collins for clarifying, although I’m not surprised. Thankful to have people in charge that care about us folk!\nwhy is the VA allowing a vender set up in the lobby of the Loma Linda California VA hospital and sell his wares of military hats, shirts license plates holders etc ALL MADE IN CHINA!!!!! as a Vietnam vet i find this very offensive. is this allowed in all VA hospitals??\nThank you, not knowing what the DOGE is or can do is confusing. Please continue to keep us informed.\nThank you for standing up for the veterans benefits and I wish you well as the Secretary of this department. We need a strong VA secretary.\nWe shall see. I have learned to not hold my breath, as it seems to be sucked out of me with every inspiration of a new president.\nyou have a very serious credibility problem\nIf you are cutting personnel you are cutting services. That’s all there is to it. The organization is already understaffed, just because it’s doing better doesn’t mean its up to snuff and removing human capital endangers the work already done. The people at DOGE know nothing about veterans, healthcare or our needs. Get them out and lead, don’t let them run some AI search and cut needed contracts because they trigger some 1984-esque word ban.\nYou’ve been there a week. Nothing you’ve done has impacted a veteran out here in the world. You may have a concept you think may work, but “clearing cases” absolutely is nothing you can take credit for. We don’t need that officer sunshine blown up our asses. We need results. Post another atta-boy-me when you’ve actually done something that shows you helped us. Cutting staff certainly isn’t going to get you there. Soon we’ll be back to 1 million backlogged compensation claims like it’s 2013 all over again. Freezing hiring won’t either, as the turn-over rate for the VA is high.\nI wanted to watch this video to see about potential cuts to my VA benefits, not to hear a speech about how wonderful donald Trump is. Stop the maga ra ra bullshit, you are suppose to represent ALL veterans, not just the ones who voted for trump, and Elon has no business looking at my imformation, period!\nJust entered VA Health Care system after retirement. VA care givers are pleasant to deal with but the VA system is not connected very well in my opinion. I only have Kaiser Health to compare it to. I have been chasing MRI/X-rays for both knees and legs for two months which was ordered by the surgeon in December and I have exhausted myself to the point of thinking about leaving the VA health and paying for part B Medicare. Anything outside of general care by primary doctor is a challenge with no follow up or phone calls on next steps. The only real help I have received to resolve my issues came from La Shawn at the Clinical contact center.\nis there any truth to the idea that for every 4 people leaving the VA ya’ll can only hire 1 replacement?? also , is the government trying to Privatize the VA???\nYou’re a rubber stamp for your one and true god TRUMP. You’re a disgrace to the humans you’ve served with and the ones who continue to serve in the US armed forces and the VA.\nYou cannot guarantee anything! We don’t believe you! You serve your god as a chaplain while simultaneously erasing humans careers, retirements, and the ability to live. Service to our country is a noble duty so many of us have all taken on, IT DOESN’T matter what you identify as. YOU HAVE A DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE.\nI like Doug Collins! He’s on the same wavelength as President Trump! No nonsense, straight talk, an honest love for America…back to good old COMMON SENSE!\nLet me know how you feel about all that in a year.\nI have great hope and belief that President Trump and his administration, to care for all people.\nPlease explain why retired military (Veterans) lose their “Tricare 4 life” benefits if they do not pay into MEDICARE part B. If a veteran is 100% disabled, (service connected) why does he/she need MEDICARE?\nIf VA is the “primary provider” why do Veterans need Medicare B?\nI’ve performed a little research on Medicare Part B in comparison to Veterans healthcare, and Part B is required to be paid by a majority of others also obtaining other exquisite Government/Military benefits, with those individuals being pretty much ordered to pay.\nHowever, those separated are typically not ordered to pay into Medicare Part B. Reading in between the lines, if the boss of a company is not paying into it’s employees’ healthcare plan (eg. Medicare Part B), how can he/she legitimately supervise those below them for whom are (struggling/risking health and) paying into Medicare Part B. On the flip, maybe I’m just giving the system an excuse, but seems only logical as owners of companies can easily exploit the system, having the system paying for their everyday careless mistakes from subsequent employee health injuries.\nAlso noteworthy, keep an eye on something called guaranteed healthcare. VA healthcare is not guaranteed, to a certain extent, and can likely be cut at anytime, forcing the individuals back into the civilian Medicare healthcare whelm. I don’t like gambling, and guessing those at risk (eg. non-service connected) should probably sign-up with Medicare Part B.\nFunny thing, nobody preaches the above requisites. Obviously though, Medicare Part B is expensive for the vast majority, and it is sometimes a decision between food on the table and a roof over your head; with a hell of a lot of other people wanting and taking from you, whether time or money.\nWith Trump lying so much, I dont believe nothing. When you say resolve the VA claims, do you mean fairly or like with Ukraine?\nPlease dont touch the benefits I EARNED. They were NOT given to me.\nI have a case that has been at the board of of appeals since February 22 waiting to be heard by a Federal Judge with a case number that has not been heard yet. I am a 100% Veteran and I get the same ole story every time I call about it. My spouse is drawing aid and attendance for taking care of me now. What seems to be the problem just asking. It seems that to me that veterans are getting put on the back burner hoping we will die before anything is done and it is too late. Sir for so many years we gave everything for our country and now when we need help we can’t get it or those that work for VA think they are giving us something for free that have never served or sacrificed as we did.Sorry for the rant but that’s how mostly all of us Vets feel.\nI am a 23 year Vietnam Veteran, who has had his life shortened by doing the right thing for our country. I am 100% disabled due to Agent Orange, which was lied to us that it would not effect us in any way, thank you President Lyndon B. Johnson, a POS democrat. After reading some of the comments on this post, I am amazed at how out of touch so many of these vets are with reality. They say that their benefits have been cut, and they have under the Biden Administration. Trump in his first term extended benefits for us. He has been in office a whole 6 weeks, and has cut so much graf out of the tax payers budget, not the VA budget, and will cut more bulls##t out of the ash and trash that Biden introduced in his kickback schemes during his first four years. I am from a small Oklahoma town, and my small VA clinic has seen more improvements in the last two month than it has seen in the last four years. Calling Trump a lier and boggyman is so far from the truth, and as for GODE, Trump would have never introduced it if he didn’t think it would benefit the citizens of this United States. He sure as hell isn’t doing it for the money, he didn’t even accept one pay check the last time. I suggest that before you go around and bash the President, do your homework first. And yes I voted for him….. twice and I do not regret it. As for you nay sayers, get a grip, get a life.\nSPOT ON RUDY\nYOU ARE CORRECT! Thanks for your Service, Rudy!\nYou’re lying. Benefits might not get cut for now, but access to care will slow as workers are indiscriminately fired. Firing all probationary employees WILL leave a mark and since the Department of Gaslighting Everyone is rummaging around in data banks of sensitive information, it’s only a matter of time before some poorly supervised stooge steals it or leaves some back door to be exploited later when all the commotion is over. You’re not fooling anybody.\nStop watching MSNBC, Mr. Thorne.\nI was feeling pretty good until I saw the word “DOGE”. They do not do anything positive and are only out to destroy.\nWell, if you read Project 2025 and make it to page 646 there is a discussion of what to do about the budget. This section is heavily focused on cost-cutting and infrastructure reform and they call the existing VA Healthcare campuses unaffordable and inefficient. With that in mind they want to cut them and rely on Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).\nSo, close the big campuses (hospitals).\nProject 2025 is about cost savings, not about improving your experience with something you earned by risking life and limb for your country.\nThank you for calling this out so clearly Jay. Project 2025 is no joke and calls out the “cost savings” that all Trump’s cronies envision. They tried to outsource and rely on Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in the first term and are making a renewed effort to do it now.\nShifting our care to CBOCs means longer waits and receiving care from providers who often don’t understand the unique needs of Veterans. The time to write to your elected representatives is NOW, especially if you reside in a district that voted for Trump, to reach out to your Representative and Senators to let them know you do not want your benefits cut. You can find them here: https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\nI’m glad you can fall into lockstep with your man fRump. Oh nevermind he has heel spurs so he can’t do anything anywhere near the military. I don’t think you have any idea what DOGE is doing especially in other locations. I hope you don’t F… up the veterans benefits but right now you can’t be trusted either.\nCollins is full of sh-t, like a typical MAGA f-cktard. He is part of the push to privatize the VA and sell it to Wall Street and Elon Musk. F-ck him, f-ck Musk, f-ck Trump. These scavengers are traitors.\nYou got that right Mr. Paul!\nReply-Russell It seems everyone on here is waiting.There is no need in being nasty, sounds like you are mad at the world. Mr Collins has only been in the job a week\nGold Star Wife\nIf you want to thank me for my service properly fund the VA Health Care System. Fill the medical staffing positions that have been cut. Take care of veterans. Meet your contractual obligations. Thank you.\nSec. Collins, I’m very excited to be working for the VA under your leadership. I should receive my start date this week. I’m a Master electrician in the state of Washington looking forward to applying my expertise at the Vancouver Washington campus. I’m also an Air Force veteran like yourself. Keep up the great work you’re achieving and thank you on behalf of all veterans.\nDon’t speak on my behalf. Stick your own head up his -ss if you want, but don’t drag me in there with you.\nDOGE is not part of our Congressional government. It was not officially authorized or funded by congress.\nVA has been short of people for a very long time, then we’re finally authorized to build their staff so more veterans could get help and quicker. Now these no nothings about VA health care come in and start down sizing.\nCollins is just another Trump minion doing what he’s told to do. Not a real LEADER for the VA. No substance to his video other than, just believe him.\nActuallly Tim, DOGE was started under Obama under a different name, the United States Digital Service. The more you know…\nHow do SES (Senior Executives) within the VA get their own flag? 90% of the work done at VA is by rank and file employees. I agreed w/ Trump when he said “drain the swamp.” Our Union (AFGE) agreed with him as well, however “the swamp” is at the top. I supported Trump up until Jan 6.\nSES employees at the top making $200,000.00 a year for doing nothing for Veterans at all. This was especially prevalent within the VBA (Veterans Benefits Administration) where managers (“coaches”) were sent to central office in DC just to screw the system up worse. I worked for VBA for 26 years. Here’s and idea for Elon/DOGE – put EVERY employee on production and have them account for their workday just like I had to for 20+ years.\nI trust this guy less than a second lieutenant with a map. Anyone believe this crap? Protect yourself and your family. Back up all your information and medical records. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins is a wrecking ball that doesn’t have the benefit of knowing what he is wrecking, and he doesn’t care about you or anyone else but trump.\nYou are obviously an American hating progressive communist.\nI work for the VA and can tell you they gutted a lot of Compensation depts to give to Contractors instead, contractors were never supposed to be doing the bulk of these exams. Now they get to make decisions no appeal, they make appointments for Veterans but don’t tell them and then say they never showed to the appointment. The project 2025 already said they were going to “look” at Benefits, you know what that means I don’t trust any thing this puppet says!\nSounds good, but how can you believe what any person trump appoints says. They are only saying what trump tells them to say, when trump’s actions indicate differently. A reduction in funding and removing 1000 employees can only increase wait times for appointments and treatments, adding to the workload of the already over worked and stressed VA staff. Upto now, at the VA hospital in Louisville kentucky, I have had excellent care and treatment with respect as a Veteran. I would hate to see the quality of care regress to what it was several years ago, when Veterans were not recieving timely care and would die. If this would happen, it would not the fault of the VA staff and employees, but trump’s and his appointments.\nThis does not address any transparency issues. This continues to devalue the role of news press, which is their role to inform the people of what our government is doing. I don’t see improvement in VA benefits, nor facilities. Your job is to ensure Veterans are getting the care they deserve based on their sacrifices for this Republic. They swore an oath to defend the constitution, not a king, nor his servants.\nGet up off your knees and raise your head. Praising a dictator is not in the job description of a VA Secretary. We’ve heard too many lies from the “king“ and his serfs. It’s not what you say, it’s what you do. We’ll be watching.\nUnfortunately this was posted as a reply… this is to the VA Secretary.\nBiden’s administration passed the PACT act and my local VA hospital was running smoothly and efficiently. At the time, I said that any vet who voted for, in Tammy Duckworth’s memorable nickname for him, “Cadet Bonespurs,” had to be insane. It turned out that more than 60% of you voted the for peabrain. You reap what you sow.\nRich, you cannot believe everything you hear on MSNBC. Set back and watch, see what President Trump does and THEN you can comment with some authority. “We the People” voted for President Trump and he is doing exactly what he said he would do, what “We the People” asked him to do. Why are you so upset, young man ? President Trump has only been in office for a few weeks, lets give him a chance before you condemn him.\nThank you for your service\nSemper Fi\nSGT USMC Vietnam Vet 66-67 100% disabled\nCommunity Care services is a absolute disaster , appointments on wrong g days and locations as well as no regard for patients available and made aware of at last minute !!!!\nDon’t believe them. President Musk & Trump are proven liars. Please remember the oath you took to protect our country’s vets.\nI was wounded twice in Vietnam, one sustained from a bouncing betty mine and one from an incoming mortar. Got neither purple heart, it’s been 58 years without benefits deserved, toughie shitski no?!!\nRespectfully, Secretary Doug Collins?! Do you really believe that anyone trust what you say in this video. You were appointed by a criminal, liar, cheater, stealer, and everything that goes against the core values on the US military. Your message is not very asurring and somewhat unprofessional when addressing the men, women and transgender community volunteers of our military forces. FAKE NEWS sir! You sound like a MAGA (not a republican) mouthpiece for a PODUS (the New King of the US) that should have been locked up and sentenced to jail, just like any other American in the US who has committed the same or like type crimes. Best wishes to you and a an empire that is getting ready to fall, just like the Romans did from greed, crimes against people, emperialist, and capitalism at the expense of tax payers dollars.\nRetired US Navy Officer, please take your Left wing political garbage somewhere else, it’s not wanted here. Not what this site is for.\nSGT USMC Vietnam Vet 66-67\nI don’t trust anyone appointed by trump, and that’s the way it is.\nI know it’s all made up by the media. You’re trump’s nominee so I don’t expect anything else from you. They will be making adjustments to the VA for “efficiency” This will change some benefits that Veterans receive and some of changes will not be in the best interest of Veterans. I hope you will make another video when these changes are implemented and explain why these changes are for the benefit to veterans. And by the way the administration stated they are using the 2025 Plan that most likely make changes for Veterans.\nI’ve had a claim pending since Oct, 2024. This guys is politician he is only telling what he is told to do to keep his job.\nGiven the fact that nobody knows what Doggy is doing and the capricious nature of this admin’s actions, I have no faith in anything that was said here. The US has a long history of screwing over veterans and this will be just another chapter in that book dating back to Washington and the first Congress denying promised pensions.\nI served 6 years, part of which was during war. I used my private insurance for my health care until after I retired . It would be good to realize that all of us veterans were trained to look out for those around us first and ourselves last. When I needed my VA benefits was when the cost of my regular healthcare threatened to take all of my substantial savings. I applied and was granted VA healthcare in recognition of my service. My medication bills went from over $1,800 per quarter to less than $100 for the same period. Keep in mind that many vets have always done what I did. We put off using our benefits until after we retired. That means the population of veterans who are being seen by the VA are more likely to have chronic diseases and need care for problems that require far more attention than the average American.\nThank-you President Trump and Secretary Collins! Most Veterans appreciate everything you’re doing.\nIf you don’t like what President Trump and DOGE are doing, it’s probably because you’re a recipient of the FRAUD, WASTE & ABUSE they are finding.\nNot hard to believe, you love trumps delusions. Sad part is his dislike for vets, especially those, who have been wounded. Cannot be seen in a parade, where the president may be seen in a photo. And to think he could not serve, due to his little toe problems. Stop with the false bullsh-t of expecting them to clean up the abuse issues. Lest we forget, the 4 trillion tax breaks for the Rich. I guess you would not mind giving, your\nretirement benefits to the cause? Would you? AJ Duke.\nSincerely Mr Collin’s (VA Secretary) with all due Respect…Congratulations on your Appointment of the Greatest most powerful Nation of Veterans in the World, but with that being said, We will hold you accountable & responsible for protecting our Benefits & Healthcare for all of This United States Veterans…Our livelihood & Healthcare depends on your commitment & Decisions as our VA Secretary ( Again the Greatest Veterans & Fighting Force in the World) DOGE Is only a Word to us Veterans & it should be to you also..Congratulations Again (Actions Speak Louder Than Words) Thank You & God Bless\nplease check my va-hotline message which explains in detail what change i feel should be made to help vets like that don’t want to be buried in a national cemetary. in my case i am 91 and already paid 11000.00 to prepare my remains to be burried next to my mother and father at a cemetary [ not va burial cemetary} and presently provisions othe than a upright stone and military ceremony are available to me . it is not fair i am sure there are many vets doing the same with no financial help..legislation should chang e to help vets like me doing the same expenses before they die. thank you peter pace\nGet up off your knees and raise your head.

I don’t think so.\nWhile I believe Secretary Collins that there are no Vet benefits being cut, I don’t believe much the rest of the BS he spouts. There have already been cuts to VA staff, including some who are Vets. Allowing Musk and his band of tech geniuses access to anything to do with the VA is ludicrous. I was on active duty in the Army from 3 May 1967 to 23 December 1970, which included two tours in Vietnam. While I was doing that, Trump was nursing his heel spurs and avoiding the Draft. Collins appears to have much more loyalty to Trump than to me and my Brother and Sister Vets.\nThe company that I work for does a lot of work at New York VA facilities. The waste I see is unbelievable, mostly due to laziness and lack of knowledge and using the system. I heard firsthand that two overhead garage doors had to be replaced at the facility. The facility super was given the task of getting a price. Several local contractors were asked for prices the best price was $18,000. Since the contractor was on the VA’S list of approved contractors, they had to go thru an already approved Veteran Contractor. The price turned out to be $32,000 dollar to do the same job. The contractor that showed up to do the job was the same contractor whose original price was $18,000. Waste at the VA.\nSo wastefulness from contractors and not the federal employees. That is what federal employees always say. Their hands are tied as to what to buy from whom and entering into contracts. But, will they actually deal with contracting fraud and abuse, of course not! That would be auditing accounts of big companies like Boeing and Space X all the way down to small companies like the one you mentioned.\nI am a VA patient with the Seattle VA Medical Center. I do not believe a thing coming from the mouth of a Trump appointee. DOGE is a hit job on the entire government by a non-elected, power-hungry oligarch. I will not be holding my breath for the “improvements” to care that this man describes. What I look forward to is a return to sanity in the federal government, a government not headed by a complete incompetent. In the interim, I will wait for the knock on my door from the goon squad.\nSpent 56 minutes on hold Tuesday for a 1 minute conversation to schedule annual eye exam. Might want to look at your numbers, bud.\nDude, you have clearly been drinking the Kool-Aid. And a lot!! You have no idea what that job is about. Be a leader instead of a puppet for propaganda for the tear down of this country.\nFlightj\nTruth! 32 years with Uncle Sugar and I never had an issue with VA Medical in 4 states, SE Asia and Europe. And I am 90% compensated since 06. As a beneficiary, YOU DO YOUR PART and the VA will do theirs.\nBy retirement in 2014 I had had my fill of babysitting grown-ass male and female and a handful of other than” Soldiers who could not even tell you their contractional MSO nor their ETS! Bitching and whining about being told what to do. YOU tell the VA what YOU need, WHY you need it, PROVE it and it happens.\nDont step up and simply say, “my computer’s BROKE”, for example! It was NEVER Uncle Sugar’s job to hold yer and hand and coddle You!\n@Flightj – that is because he is a “There we are then” person, purposely appointed by MAGA, the future King Trump or Vance of the USA. Definitely NOT TRUE Republicans. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/twat?q=TWAT\nGet the phone system at the Malcom Randall Hospital FIXED!\nVA disability needs a overhaul In how they determine vets are service connected. Range of motion is not the “ONLY” way to determine one has lasting injuries just because it helps weed out claims so the government can turn their back on veterans. Thats one instance. Hearing loss – you put anyone in a soundproof box and then turn on sounds, of course you can hear them, but if your in the real world this doesn’t apply. In the real world so many other sounds are also going on that make hearing at a loss and not how we used to hear prior to military. Some age does apply and that could be taken into effect, but the current system is flawed. Only able to apply for one Mental issue? So if i have PTSd and also a mental aspect due to pain in another area, they cannot be applied together? sorry pick one. The whole program needs to be overhauled to help protect veterans. We waste a whole day for a simple dr visit if we go to the VA and the people working dont give 2 sh-ts about us. Then to get seen out in town by a truly qualified Dr not trying to just save a buck and push pills, well no way. Denied. or if on the choice program, We shouldn’t have to go get pre approval to see my choice if my out in town doctor determines i need treatment. How about if you get 12 visits to a chiro, but chiro says you need more. Denied. you should be fixed by now. Just ignore all future request that are sent in. Its a basic waste of resources and funds to keep the VA. Just give us the ability to go in town to our own choice of Doctor to be seen and get healed in our manner, Even if not the typical doctor pushing pills and its one that uses natural medicine or plant medicine to cure.\nThis man is a Trumper. I dont believe a word he says and I am very concerned about my veteran benifits\nThank you for putting that video out. I liked the “to the point” straightforwardness of your comments. It does make me feel more at ease hearing the truth.\nDurham VA dental clinic does not answer their phone nor do they return voicemail calls. I have left 7 messages in the last 3 weeks and no response! I am 100% permanent disability and am eligible for dental care but the clinic in Durham is incognito! Help!\nHi, John. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nI’m glad he is in office. I’m a Vietnam Vet. I have a disability case that as gone on for about 1 yr. I am now type 2 diabetes. This should be a slam dunk because of agent orange. The VA turned me down this first time. I appealed and they admitted their error and it’s still has not been resolved. This shows that cases are not getting done quickly.\nThey never have! They are understaffed and the Feds are not in the business to approve any case easily as the VA is the second highest spending in the government.\nWhen you allowed Musk (a fascist and Na–)-and his band of juvenile hackers, access to our VA data – you already betrayed the Veteran community. Your slick videos and worthless press releases will never gain you the credibility and respect that is essential to lead. Project 2025 targets Veterans benefits. We are not stupid -we can read. I suggest you reread your oath to the Constitution. As a Veteran, from a Family of Veterans – I cannot imagine why any sane person would support a convicted felon, rapist, draft dodger as our CIC. A person who has absolutely no respect or appreciation for service – and openly mocks disabled Veterans, will never, ever be worthy of respect. Do better.\nI felt like you were trying to sell me a car and slash the prices. And by the way DOGE is not an official department. All you idiots think that two billionaires care about low income and middle class workers. They are the reincarnation of capitalism and the abolishment of government. Guess what ?! The VA is government! Supported by federal money! You sir are completely unprofessional and your statement meant nothing. I hope for the Best Buy expect nothing but the worst from you and your dictators Elon and Trump.\nYou hit the nail on the head. Never buy a “car” or whatever else they are are sell. We are all doomed.\nI can tell that you are a Democrat and have very low IQ. It is your type of thinking that has almost destroyed this country. President Trump and Doug Collins are both working hard to save this country and the VA. Please move to Iran and talk bad about their leadership and see how long you will live.\nHere, Here. Agree whole heartedly. They are following project 2025 by the book, in case, well it seems that no-one has noticed. After, or once they finish, decimating the Pentagon and DOD. We are next. The DOGeS, have hip waiters on. And some teen hackers who know coding and computers real good will be barking down the doors of freedom and liberty, soon! We must unite, against this domestic enemy, and stand as one. Lets make noise and show what joke jr-6, was.\nFast talking used car salesman. Don’t buy into the lies. We’re screwed.\nWe had an oversite group in place with inspectors general for our government. I do not want DOGE who has no legal right to be in any VAs information or looking into how the VA is run. Get them out of our business, there is no way we really know what they are gathering and keeping. You say the savings will reinvested into bettering benefits, but there is no words to that or any guarantees from money hungry billionaires. Please put a stop to this invasion from DOGE. Your message did nothing but confirm how undercover they are invading our government agencies with no legitimate right.\nWaiting for 6,8,10 months for a benefits claim is not a good look for the VA. The backlog is not sustainable and very frustrate those in need. Let’s find solutions.\nFiring more people is definitely not the answer, when they are already understaffed.\nI’m thrilled and excited about President Trump and Doug Collins doing the right thing. I trust both and I know that they will Make America Great Again.\nThanks for your help.\nThank you Secretary Collins, for having our backs, for putting the truth out to the veteran community, for working hand-in-hand with the great work that DOGE is conducting, and for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our Great President (President Trump)!!!\nYou are very much appreciated Mr. Collins and we are so grateful that you are our Secretary of Veteran Affairs!\nSincerely,\nB.K. Gilbert (Retired EOD Chief, USN)\nThank you, Mr. Secretary. Looking forward to the administration’s success!\nThis message seems to skirt around possible data breaches regarding veterans personal information. DOGE has already broken numerous laws and it’s difficult to imagine that an unelected immigrant from South Africa cares about Veterans personal information being compromised.\nVietnam vets were screwed during the Obama years. In 2019 the Blue Water Naval Act of 2019 was passed by Trump and immediately the VA improved. Trump was given an overwhelming mandate to turn around the mess the Zombie president has left us.\nThis video is well-timed and provides good reassurance. But, can we trust it? The tone was overly partisan toward the Trump administration instead of being a nonpartisan head of the VA, which is NOT a partisan subject.\nFor the record, it was Biden who got the PACT act through and never talked poorly about veteran status (like DJT talking about John McCain’s status).\n???????????????\nThank you and thank God for Trump and Elon Musk. I hope DOGE will fix the Biden problems at VA.\nAll the hate directed at Elon and Trump is hilarious. Clearly bots. None of them address REAL veteran concerns. Like the fact that we can’t even watch the video without a YouTube account. We can submit anything about our problems with the webservice because the pages don’t load. We can’t ever get directly in touch with our teams anymore, it’s all online, and as previously mentioned, the pages don’t load. Not even to submit a bug!\nSince you are a Trump appointee, how can we be assured that when Elon Musk and his minions come calling, you will not capitulate to their demands?\nYou are lieing\nAny Vets that voted for Trump Jon Un now complaining about what he and his cronies and Musk are doing to our country with their ‘scorched earth’ project 2025 strategy (just like Putin or any other dictator), are just as complicit in this traitorous, authoritarian condescension, destruction of democracy and abandonment of American citizens. Don’t even try to argue that Trump/Musk/Project2025 and this congress is comparable to previous administrations. That s**t won’t fly. The average American voter is the dumbest (and most destructive) imbecile on the entire planet, bar none, with no idea what true patriotism is. It is they who are to blame, and it is they that must change their ways if our nation is to survive.\nWOW, right on the money. I could not have said it better. Thanks for speaking up. When do we march?\nYou are obviously an American hating progressive communist.\nI hope THEY are listening. Can’t believe grownups (MAGA GOP) are too scared to stand against tyranny, corruption, and now forsaking our allies for the war criminal Putin.\nOh my gosh, No Hope. Seek Help, SOON !\nHe talked but didn’t address concerns! The rumors are in Projection 2025! Firing Veterans from the Pentagon! I am sick of this.\nBenefits may not be getting cut but services are. The recent releasing of probationary positions as a RIF has very seriously impacted the Mental Services Department of the Danville IL VA. And now it will take months if not years to get positions filled again. Someone needs to rethink the hirring practices. It’s oudated and to slow. Veterans need better now, not in 6 months.\nI hope Director Collins is wise enough to reverse the firering in some areas and restore staffing before it’s too late.\nVeterans are depending on you.\nI, along with the rest of the veterans, will be holding you to this statement.\nIf this is a temporary distraction by you while they decide how they are going to dismantle our benefits, there will be a reckoning. You will have to explain why you did not protect and expand our benefits as you are now saying you will. Keep this in mind. We certainly will.\nYou don’t have to understand our lack of trust in this administration, you are tasked with building some level of trust in a country gone mad.\nBenefits should increase whenever they are supporting service connected health issues.\nI see all these negative comments about poor service and claims which have not been resolved for years, however, the criticism was never voiced during the past 4 years, during the Biden era. Did these cases suddenly occur now that President Trump is in office, or Mr. Collins coming onboard recently? My opinion is, those who are complaining are politically motivated and not a true measure of veterans nationwide. Regarding DOGE and Elon Musk, who was appointed by President Trump to oversee the waste and abuse of our tax dollars, why would anyone with common sense condemn such research? Should our billions in tax dollars be given away freely, with no accounting?\nBingo!! You hit the nail on the head…\nConsider the source – Just the “LEFT” being vocal with no substantial evidence of anything other than their own distorted view.\nBecause, like it or not, we got our benefits expanded under the last administration. You may hate Biden, but we weren’t being gutted like we were under the first Trump admin, and now they are accelerating the gutting process because they don’t care about veterans as much as they care about cutting costs for their Oligarch friends.\nBeing a Vietnam Veteran exposed to Agent Orange I’m experiencing medical problems for the pass 13 years. My private medical doctors say you can’t rule out that the cause wasn’t from agent orange, but of course the VA rejected my claim. But all the VA information says they don’t know the full scope of problems caused by Agent Orange.\nThe VA has been very good to me. I served my Country without any thought of a “payback “. However the GI bill helped with my advanced education, while the health care has helped me through serious issues.\nThank you President Trump and Director Collins. Remain vigilant and caring.\nYour video reminds me of a 1970s TV commercial by Ronco. “It slices! It dices!” Well it better not slice and dice my benefits. That includes the VA privatization scam from the Koch Brothers astroturfing “Concerned Veterans of America” and Heritage Foundation. And if I find out DOGE has been in my VA medical records, expect a HIPAA violation lawsuit.\nYou are not believable. Any one who has to disparage anything including the media to make your point holds no weight. I have been waiting ages for my disability rating to be increased and now I have to worry about the security of my VA data on top of all this. Praising DOGE and Trump is counter productive to all people with a brain. Results. We need results dumb videos.\nThank you Secretary Collins, we veterans are glad you ate leading the VA now. Please get rid of the woke crap that has poisoned are VA system. Under President Trump’s first term we were treated with respect and dignity. The last four years under O’Biden and Harris has been demeaning and difficult foe us veterans. We have had to deal with transgender staff, what pronouns do you go by signs, rainbow flags and safe space signs on the entry doors to the VA clinics and hospitals and ridiculous videos on the screens at the hospital and emails related to DEI and wokeism. They took all of the military related signs and information in the halls and replaced them with stupid unrelated so called artwork throughout the hospital. I mentioned it to the maintenance workers when they pulled the military stuff down and they said, “We don’t want too, but we were told we had to do it or lose our jobs.” Please bring back an American and Patriotic VA that respects our military and it’s veterans. I go to the Orlando, Florida, Lake Nona VA Hospital\nThank you sir,\nRespectfully,\nJohn Morris\nUSN American Patriot\nI read what you have experienced, not in my Community Based VA Clinic. In Arkansas. I was familiar with a Veteran Arts competition that was nation wide and regional. I think it was called creative arts something, I entered it and the Vets that submitted were given a show in Austin Tx, VA Hospital. The pictures, paintings and various art forms were from all Veterans-combat, Vietnam, Gulf War, Desert Storm (Mine). We got some certificates and a ribbon. So if you did not like the art work on the walls did you bother checking if was from some of your Patriot Brothers? Or do do you just like talking smack? And insulting us, Combat Vets, Retirees, Veterans and Brothers in Arms. Jerk-Off\nOh poor thing, how “difficult” it was for you to walk into a building and see a pride flag. How did you ever survive such horrible treatment? I sure hope you put a claim in for that.\nJust so you know, gay and transgender people exist, even in the military. And a real patriot serving in the military, a real leader, would fight for all and include all Americans who are willing to fight alongside you.\nGet over yourself.\nI believe nothing that comes out of these individuals mouths. You all are kowtowing to a psychopath. God help us all.\nDoug Collins is a slick talking trump appointee ie, a liar. If his mouth is moving, he is fibbing. I wouldn’t buy a used cat from the guy. DOGE is out to destroy the middle class. All the money taken from us, will be spent to continue tax cuts for Elon and the other ultra rich. If you believe otherwise, you are a gullible fool. This IS PROJECT 2025, and it’s only the beginning.\nWhy are we no longer being provided with eyeglasses? We are eligible for exams but not the actual pair of eyeglasses as we had received in the past.\nI have no benefits after my husbands Carlos death will this be changed at all he was 75 % disabled he went and fought in Korea ???Carlos Mann was an honorable man ??thank you Shirley Mann\nShirley you need to go to a local V.A. office and find out if you can get DIC payment for spouse.\nWelcome to the Veterans Team Sir, and as I know you all will continue to do great things to make the Veterans Services even greater. Me and my wife are retired Army Veterans and support the VA always.\nMr Secretary Collins, Welcome! I preface by reminding that my best VA experience was during Vet Friendly DJ Trump’s last term. After that came the purge, and change era. Veteran Benefit Cuts? That happened during the last 4 years (Biden), a purge of experienced doctors and nurses, replaced with inexperienced training less experienced. No one answers phones when you need, you leave a message and they call if, and when they want! The re vamped computer systems that are harder to use and deliver less Vet desired information? A joke! How much did that exercise cost? Who did that really benefit? Veterans clearing cases faster? Don’t be fooled CLEARING Claims is not a benefit to Vets Assisting to, and approving Claims is what benefits vets.\nThe media is part of the last administration, and will continue trying to misinform as always! DOGE? We should all WELCOME DOGE with open arms! President Trump has a track record of helping Military, and Vets at all levels, and it 110% transparent in his actions, which guarantees, All the money from waste found would be redirected to benefit the Veterans, not taken from them. DOGE will find if they HAVE BEEN stealing the money from you, as in the other departments of government.\nWelcome again Secretary Collins.\n4. End VA’s Individual Unemployability Payments to Disabled Veterans at the Full Retirement Age for Social Security: This option would take effect in January 2026.\nA) End IU payments to all veterans age 67 or older.\nB) End IU payments to all veterans age 67 or older who would begin receiving IU after December 2025.\nT he Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides disability compensation to veterans with medical conditions or injuries that were incurred or worsened during active-duty service. The amount of compensation depends on the severity of their disabilities (which are rated between zero and 100 percent) and other factors. In addition, VA may increase certain veterans’ disability compensation to the 100 percent level even though the department has not rated their service-connected disabilities at that level. To receive the resulting supplemental compensation, termed Individual Unemployability (IU) payments, disabled veterans must apply for the benefit and meet two criteria. First, they generally must have a disability rating between 60 percent and 90 percent. Second, VA must determine that the veterans cannot maintain “substantial gainful employment” because of the severity of a service-connected disability. Receipt of IU is not based on age, voluntary withdrawal from work, or other factors.\nThis option consists of two alternatives. Under the first, VA would stop making IU payments to veterans age 67 or older (the full retirement age for Social Security benefits for those born after 1959).\nThat restriction would apply to both current and prospective recipients.\nWhen veterans reached age 67, all VA disability payments would revert to the amount associated with the rated disability level; veterans age 67 or older who were already receiving IU payments would no longer receive them after the effective date of the option.\nUnder the second alternative, veterans who began receiving the IU supplement after December 2025 would no longer receive those payments once they reached age 67, and no new applicants age 67 or older would be eligible for IU benefits after that date.\nVeterans currently receiving IU payments who would reach age 67 or older after the effective date of the option would continue to collect the IU supplement.\n3. Introduce Means-Testing for Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation.\nVeterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or worsened during active-duty service may receive disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Payments are structured differently than other disability programs. VA’s disability payments are intended to compensate for the average earnings that veterans would be expected to lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or injuries, whether or not a particular veteran’s condition reduced his or her earnings. Unlike disability programs such as Social Security Disability Insurance, payments are unaffected by a veteran’s earnings or other types of income.\nUnder this option, VA would means-test (that is, restrict full compensation to those with income below a certain amount) all current and prospective recipients of VA’s disability compensation.\nBeginning in January 2026, veterans with service-related disabilities and total household income below $135,000, excluding disability income from the VA, would receive full benefits.\nThat threshold corresponds to the 70th percentile of total household income in the United States in 2022, adjusted for inflation to reach the threshold value applicable to 2026 benefits.\nCBO estimates that nearly 30 percent of veterans receiving disability payments from VA will have household income above that threshold in 2026. (After 2026, that income threshold would rise with the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers.)\nAbove the threshold, benefits would be phased out at a constant rate: For every additional two dollars of gross household income, disability compensation would decrease by one dollar.\nPlease talk to the proposals submitted to the CBO December 12, 2024 that proposed in the future:\nDecember 12, 2024 Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2025 to 20342.\nNarrow Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation by Excluding Veterans With Low Disability Ratings – This option would take effect in\nJanuary 2026:\nA) Require disability ratings of 30 percent or higher for disability compensation for all veterans.\nB) Require disability ratings of 30 percent or higher for disability compensation for new applicants.\nVeterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or worsened during active-duty service may receive disability compensation from the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\nThe amount of compensation depends on the severity of their disabilities (which are rated between zero and 100 percent) and other factors. By law,\nVA’s disability ratings (the basis for disability payments) are to be based, as far as practicable, on the average earnings that veterans would be expected\nto lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or injuries.\nThose ratings do not depend on whether a particular veteran’s conditions reduce his or her earnings.\nUnder this option’s first alternative, VA would narrow eligibility for disability compensation by REQUIRING A DISABILITY RATING OF 30 PERCENT OR\nHIGHER FOR ALL VETERANS. AS A RESULT, SOME CURRENT RECIPIENTS WOULD NO LONGER RECIEVE BENEFITS.\nThe second alternative would require a 30 percent or higher disability rating only for new disability compensation applicants.\n(Current recipients would not be affected.) CBO estimates that in 2026, about 20 percent of veterans will have a disability rating below 30 percent.\nSee like a bunch of liberal hacks are on this page. The funny thing is they’re blaming Trump for their sh-tty medical care and other benefits. Uhm, nice try. He has only been in office a few weeks. Your sh-tty care was under Biden.\nAnd the congregation said AMEN…\nI have received the BEST care possible, for the past years. Several MAJOR surgeries. Jaw Joint Replaced, Neck Fusion, lower back fusion. No wait times. Biden brought us the PACT ACT.\nAmen to that !\nPlease talk to the proposals submitted to the CBO December 12, 2024 that proposed in the future:\nDecember 12, 2024 Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2025 to 2034\n1. Include VA’s Disability Payments in Taxable Income:\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides disability compensation to veterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or\nworsened during active-duty service. By law, VA’s disability ratings (the basis for disability payments) are to be based, as far as practicable,\non the average earnings that veterans would be expected to lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or\ninjuries. Those ratings do not depend on whether a particular veteran’s conditions reduce that person’s earnings.\nDisability compensation is not means-tested, (restricted to those with income below a certain amount), and payments are exempt from income taxes.\nPayments are in the form of monthly annuities and typically continue until the beneficiary’s death.\nNote: See Proposed “Introduce Means-Testing for Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation.”\nThis option would include VA’s disability benefit payments in taxable income.\nDoug Collins also says he isn’t a huge bundle of sticks, so can he be trusted?\nLet’s make this country the best it can be. Thanks for being on the front lines for us veterans. My comrades deserve it!\nA statement that wasn’t a statement. Anything to support your troll of a king.\nhow about giving dental care?\nWhy can’t we get an insurance card and a list of Doctors to go to when we are sick or need a specialist. If your sick you have to drive down to the hospital ER. I recently tried to get an appointment with a dermatologist finally got one 3month out. I went to an outside Dr. for my condition. Tried to get help with community care. No help. Filed a formal complaint never heard anything.\nIt has been reported that the VA Crisis Hotline has been hit with staff firings. Is this true?\nBlaming it on the “press” is not going to cut it. Thousands of VA employees have all been let go. Any veteran will have his or her own personal story of observation. Collectively, veterans are heroes, survivors and fighters NOT “suckers and losers”. To have two non-veteran lackeys taking away our veteran rights is a travesty. Vets have to keep their opens open and stay strong!\nSlower than ever I put in a dependent change August 1, 2024 and still in received status. 7 months? Really ?\nArticle seems like a one sided snow job. You should already be doing what you say DOGE is doing. The military playing politics is how PUTIN works.\nI’m also have a claim on process for then three years and waiting.\nYou said: DOGE representatives at VA are reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans.\n1st – DOGE do not know what the hell they doing. No experience at all.\n2nd – YOU don’t have not experience SO that make YOU don’t know what the hell you are doing.\n3rd – That so call President NOT a president, HE IS A BULLY, LAIR MAN getting PAID for the future.\n4th – How dare you make a Video saying what this so called President NOT going to do. I bet you want tell him that in Front of his face.\n5th – To say more, why don’t you send this Video to the SO CALL PRESIDENT and have him to address it LIVE on TV so millions of voters can watch it.\n6th – To do MORE, why don’t you HIRE Veterans (Wives) to do what DOGE does know how to review contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans. VETERANS ARE THE ONLY ONES KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE NOT DOING. We as Veterans deserve better services.\n7th – STOP THE BULLS??T, and COME CLEAN BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT LIKE THE SMELL OF IT.\n8th – And the last thing- go back and listen to YOUR Video and tell me ONE thing you DID NOT say WHAT THE AMERICANS and VETERANS WANTS TO HEAR. This tells me you ARE NOT the Secretary of Veterans Affairs we are looking for.\n#“ DROP THE ? “\nFrom a Vietnam Vet: You do not speak for me. God bless and protect Trump from all his enemies foreign and domestic like you.\nNicely put. We think alike.\nDid you finish grade school ? This is NOT a political site so please take your Leftwing garbage somewhere else. I disagree with you completely.\nAs a veteran, I am truly grateful for the care and support I have received from the VA. From the moment I reached out for assistance, the staff was professional, compassionate, and committed to ensuring I had access to the benefits and services I needed.\nThe healthcare services have been excellent, with knowledgeable doctors and nurses who genuinely care about veterans’ well-being. Scheduling appointments has been straightforward, and the quality of care has exceeded my expectations. The benefits office has also been incredibly helpful in guiding me through the process, making it easy to understand my entitlements and how to access them.\nBeyond medical care, the VA provides invaluable resources for employment, education, and financial assistance, which have been instrumental in helping me transition successfully into civilian life. Their dedication to veterans is evident in every interaction, and I appreciate their continued efforts to improve and expand their services.\nI highly recommend the VA to fellow veterans seeking reliable healthcare and support. Their commitment to serving those who have served is truly commendable!\nFirst i trust the media and always have as secretary of the VA do the job for the veterans who made our country safe and not for DODGE TRUMP OR MUSK\nThank you Secretary Collins, we veterans are glad you are leading the VA now. Please get rid of the woke crap that has poisoned are VA system. Under President Trump’s first term we were treated with respect and dignity.

I go to the Orlando, Florida, Lake Nona VA Hospital\nThank you sir\nFaster than what? For fifty years I have sought the simplest of services, nothing. Last Jully I filed again, got diagnosed with PTSD, Chemical poisoning, hearing loss, etc etc. Still nothing. In fact, trying to trace my claim, it was sent to another office in another state just to be lost again. I’m tired of this crap. I don’t have that much time left on this earth and I’m stressing anymore over it.\nDear Sir\nI am a 90 year-old Navy Veteran with 32 years of Naval Service. In 1971, I was ordered to Viet Nam, where I was exposed to the Agent Orange defoliant and subsequently developed Prostate Cancer.

Last September 2024, I filed a VA Form 21-8940 to apply for increased compensation based on unemployability. I have completed all the evidence , underwent a physical exam, but still awaiting to hear of any decision.

While he sat back and took his deferment for a painful bone spur. His support is non-existent except where it serves him.\nYes I agree. Claims are not being processed faster, slower by the day. I have a dependant claim for over a year now. Why? When all.it takes is to add my daughter back to my compensation claim.\nLIAR!LIAR!LIAR!\nComments being censored ?\nYes, they are.\nThanks, for the info, You have always done greatwork in Washington, welcome aboard,sir,\nVA Hospital needs central scheduling. Started to use the Durham VA medical and to make an appointment have to call the various clinics directly and leave a message and hope to get a return call in several weeks to schedule an appointment that could be months out. Crazy.\nWaiting moderation ? Is this sensorship ?\nIt’s censorship….but yes, that is what it is.\nCongratulation on your appointment,\nI just want to ask a quick question here. I recently broke off two front teeth right down to the gum line. I need implants that cost $10,000 .00 to repair this. My Dental insurance won’t cover it because they say that it is cosmetic. The VA only will cover up to $1000.00, and it has to be done by someone that excepts Veterans Choice coverage which will only be $1000.00. Is their anything I can do to get this fully covered by the VA? The VA tried to give me an implant on a molar a few years ago and they botched it. So I am going to Clear Choice Implant center to get this work done. I have only one shot at this and I need someone who does nothing but implants. I have a 100 % disability from the Vietnam War and I am struggling with Small B Cell Lymphoma from agent Orange exposure and medical bills are mounting up. Thank You for letting me contacting you.\nHi, Geno, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nI was recently at the VA center in Hot Springs Arkansas and felt terrible about the way the older VETS were treated . I am 77and am lucky to have younger people to help me get to places like Hot Springs. this is a beautiful complex, proud of it. I was there for my eyesite exam. Older crippled vets had wives or friends pushed them inside. Once ‘inside’ they were told to go back out the door, take a left and walk back up a walkway to the end of the other building and look for a tent with their number on it and go in. This was done on the outside. Some Vets asked what was going on and were told where everyone could hear, that the other place had poor air quality had, not been repaired. This was over a year old they were told. Very sad.\nI am so thankful for our VA Services.\nThings do however take a long time. I have had a claim in for @ 6 months and no word on the status. So maybe more transparency on claims would be helpful.\nGod bless you, President Trump and the USA\nHi, Dan, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nFaster than ever! Yeah right. Claim and reviews are taking longer than ever. Says 140 days. Some one is feeding mis information.\nAlso say you are improving taking care of vets. But what i see is a system designed to reject vets. For sure the vets that are getting older. You have vets that are young and only served two years being taken care of better than old vets that served 8 to 20 years.\nMaybe you can explain why staff at VA hospitals are being reduced! That’s a fact!\nThis happens quite often especially now that more veterans are opting for video or phone appointments. This also happens if the VA hired way more staff than what’s necessary.\nI would love VA’s dental plan to be expanded. I currently pay for the Met Life program offered by VA but am still unable to pay for dental treatments that are needed. The copays and out of pocket are still expensive.\nYou either lie or are naive. I no longer trust you or the government of the former United States.\nWe defended the United States yet you traded it for a red hat.\nYou’re not allowed to be surprised when programs and benefits are cut. This is what you wanted when YOU voted against democracy.\nI am not buying it. VA just fired my PCP that had only been on the job for a few months. Now I am without…again.\nI have been suffering from crippling asthma and constant shortness of breath since my deployments to the middle east where I sat on top of diesel generators, worked with asbestos, and inhaled gas and excrement fumes for months on end. The VA has been willing to prescribe me combivent respimat medication for COPD and Advair, but REFUSES to diagnose me with asthma and approve my 10% disability claim for 14 years. I have done everything I need to do after the passing of the PACT act. I am tired of suffering.\nSecretary Collins,\nI understand that outsourcing C&P exams takes in excess of 10 Billion dollars out of the Administrations’ budget. As a veteran subject to at least 15 of these outsourced exams I think it’s time to move these exams back into the VA medical facilities. While I understand that the exams were outsourced to provide timely care, they have turned into a money grab by the providers.\nMany of these exams are being administered by providers in small offices with questionable qualifications. They are more likely than not to deny a service connection lest they offend their cash cow.\nA lot of people don’t understand what is going on, the ruling wealthy class (top 1%) want to “Make America Great Again” by turning back the hands of time to the past, not the 1950’s as many believe (when the tax rate was 94% on the wealthy), but to the 1890’s, The Gilded Age (the time of the Robber Barons). For those that don’t know the real history of this time period: https://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/plutocracy/\nSo how did things get this bad that the ruling class could turn back time to a period in our history that was far worse for the working class? Brainwashing. The ruling class took the teachings of Edward Bernays (author of the book Propaganda), the nephew of Sigmund Freud, and have been using that to control the masses ever since. Bernays took his uncle’s work in the subconscious mind and perverted it into a means of controlling the masses.

I do not want DOGE who has no legal right to be in any VAs information or looking into how the VA is run. Get them out of our business, there is no way we really know what they are gathering and keeping. You say the savings will reinvested into bettering benefits, but there is no words to that or any guarantees from money hungry billionaires. Please put a stop to this invasion from DOGE. Your message did nothing but confirm how undercover they are invading our government agencies with no legitimate right.\nAbsolutely!!! I am a liberal–not a Democrat nor Republican, but someone who believes in freedom and human rights (equality for all people at every stage, income, race, creed, or religion) and I am horrified by how many veterans, people of faith, and those who claim to support the veterans can believe that this president is or ever was, an honest or honorably devoted servant of the people of this country or, and especially, its veterans. I am sick with grief over how the veterans are going to be treated by this administration.\nThey go on camera and feed us a line of BS thinking we will stay calm and forget our concerns. They have an agenda to gut social programs across the board, including VA benefits, to offset their funding of tax cuts for the uber wealthy plutocrats.\nWe elected the wrong people and now we will suffer the consequences.\nMost of us was mislead what the president said\nWe? You did, speak for yourself.\nTrump & Musk Are Lying and are Dangerously Taking Apart the Government to enrich themselves. Our Privacy Rights Have Been Violated. Veterans Heath Care Has Been Cut by Firing VA workers when there is a Shortage of 50,000 plus Unfilled Jobs at the VA Today . PLEASE STOP LYING TO VETERANS WE DESERVE SOO MUCH BETTER. Wake Up Veterans We have been Duped\nAmen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nNo offense, but any man who said that Veterans were suckers to go to Vietnam, who avoided doing his patriate duty because of a “bone spur” , attempted to overthrow the election results by sending his mop to the Capital then giving pardons to those who convicted and sentenced for that attach and is a convicted felony himself and not be trusted to protect the very vets he belittled.\nOH, yeah that’s the spirit. It’s them pesky Maggots that are the main problem. We know it was a tough vote between a zombie and and then a woman by God. Pray for healing and knowledge to voters and constituents, to learn about not only his evil ways, but his followers and ministry of capitalism. Sometimes we just have vote against the evil regimes. Allah Akbar, er Praise God that is, Gulf War One flashback.\nThank you for informing that benefits will continue to stay sane for veterans that deserve them. It’s a great relief!\nIt would be nice to keep the same nurses and doctors for a while sir. The VA is a rotating door. It’s getting annoying to keep going through doctors etc.\nAlso you should have a public email for us to contact. Even if it’s through your staff.\nFill the 50,000 Unfilled jobs at the VA. Disabled Veterans Do Not Want the 2017 Mission Act To Privatize the Healthcare At The VA; It is Mistreating Veterans. Sitting In Waiting Rooms for Hours at Private Clinics and Hospitals is Painful and not what Veterans Want or Deserve. Last Time Trump Was In He Damaged The Health Care of Veterans. Trump Hates Veterans, Trump is A Vietnam War Draft Dodger who is only interested in his wealth And Riches.\nMajor Richards Star Act is a SHAM. Only officers who served in Vietnam were all declared 100% disable due to agent orange exposure. Even Navy officers on ships miles off shore. The VA transferred funds for the disability from the veterans retirement fund. These officers can now qualify for 100% free real estate taxes and other perks.\nThe rest of us who served in areas where the toxic chemical was sprayed get shunned or expelled by the VA hosp.\nI could go on and write a book. I’m OK with the VA treating us like dirt. I’m not OK with the 30-50 vets that commit suicide daily because of the VA.\nWe all know(veterans) that Doug Collins or any individual will not help any veteran or change any VA processes to better accommodate veterans at all. For decades, veterans have been s@&t upon with no changes. Everyone knows that federal workers are only there just to ride the taxpayer funded gravy train, do their time, retire and once again receive the taxpayer funded pension to live out their life very comfortably. All the while, veterans who fought for these people to have the lives that they do, get nothing much in return. It’s been that way forever and will not change, no matter who’s in charge of VA.\nIn 2016, I applied for VA healthcare and was denied based on my salary and the county (California)that I live in. Fast forward two years, I revisited that decision with a VA counselor. I was told by that counselor that I should have automatically been approved because of my time in Persian Gulf and Desert Storm. That’s a very simple example of how unorganized the VA is.\nI do have two claims that I’m waiting for a decision on, upon which I know VA will reject. Because that’s just what the VA does, deny, deny, deny.\nWhy isn’t Tinnitus considered an auto-grant for veterans with clear exposure to harmful noise. Tinnitus is a permanent condition, there is no cure, and severely impacts the lives of thousands of veterans that served this country faithfully. We don’t need more bombs, we don’t need doge, we don’t need controversy, what we need is better care for veterans.\nI agree, my disability claims have been resolved quickly, with the VA App I’ve watched them zoom through all 8 steps. My annual primary care visit was very pleasant, blessed to have a good doctor. I’m proud of the VA.\nI am a Vietnam veteran. I am addressing the facilities at Long Beach CA. This facility is huge. The first problem to address is parking!!! They need to build a large parking structure. The other problem is knowing where to go. It is just a large maze to wander around not only to find parking but also to find where to go and also to find your car.\nI go to Laguna Hills facility and it is in my opinion a great job done!\nThank You,\nCarl Jokinen US Coast Guard 1969-73\nPresident Elon just fired about 1,000 probationary employees just from the VA. That was a ‘media’ story. Are you saying that’s not true? And can’t all the stuff Elon is doing actually your job? Seems to me Elon is the republicans definition of a DEI hire. He’s an immigrant, on the autism spectrum, and 3 of his children have birthright citizenship.\nmr. collins.\nwhat about the 1000 workers that were recently let go that provided vets services? treatments for vets with cancer, respiratory problems, missing limbs, and opioid addiction. that move certainly backs up your comment about insuring care for vets.\nand allowing the richest man in the world to have access to VA information and suggest possible (dubious) ways to save money?\nmr. collins is an election denier, climate denier, once said democrats love terrorists, and has completely followed and supported trump\non every other major position.\nhere are a few suggestions for cutting government expenses…\nA Government Accountability Office report from 2019 said that four Trump trips to Mar-a-Lago totaled $13.6 million for the travel and security costs. If you do the math, that means Trump’s three trips to Mar-a-Lago in the first month of his second term tallied up to at least $10.2 million. Trump’s Super Bowl trip cost taxpayers at least $1 million just for the air travel and regular Secret Service detail that travels with the president. The field trip to the Daytona 500 event—where he stayed for roughly 90 minutes—likely cost taxpayers at least $373,000.\nThat’s based on the fact that it costs $177,843 per hour to operate Air Force One, according to information the outlet the War Zone obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2022. White House pool reports said the flight times between Daytona and Mar-a-Lago were roughly an hour each, plus the daily cost of $17,520 for the Secret Service detail, per Snopes, and you land at the $373,000 figure.\nIn all, Trump’s travel during his first month in office cost taxpayers at least $11.4 million.\njust sayin’.\nit is apparent to me that mr. collins will do whatever president musk and vp trump tell him to do.\nplease, at least treat vets with some dignity and honesty and tell them what you plan to do so that we have some time to prepare and adjust.\nrichard isom\ndisabled veteran, usaf\nFAKE NEWS from another King Trump MAGA croney and not a trustworthy Republican! Seriously, Mr Doug Collins. You really expect us to believe this?\nThis is a lie! It took 7 years to finally get my disability benefits. Last August 2024 I finally was scheduled my exams which I completed and last month January 2025 I finally received my disability benefits! But three weeks later last Monday February 2025 I get a call to schedule all of the very same medical exams AGAIN only 6 months after I took them and three weeks AFTER I received my final disability adjudication!! Talk about a DOGE violation of waste of taxpayer money! Or the VA is trying to claw back my earned disability benefits as an EOD (bomb disposal) technician! So the VA IS trying to cut veterans benefits and my case, now on its 8th year is an example of Collins doing it! Next email is to my Congresswoman and news so they can monitor my case losing my benefits!\nCollins, you sound like a trump appointed political hack. I’ve already been affected. My medication refill was simply removed or disappeared. Appt scheduling is worse.\nSpeak the truth or don’t speak at all\nMy question is, why does the secretary need DOGE to show him how to be more efficient? Shouldn’t he already have measure’s in place for that?\nSo it’s the media’s fault. They are lying. I wish you would not have said that. That’s nothing but the same lame political propaganda this new administration peddles out there to the public. And right off the bat. I don’t expect problems to be resolved in 2 weeks, that ludicrous. Change must come from a thoughtful, meaningful process. Not politicized nor chaotic. Taking a sledge hammer to it will not work. Firing countless personnel who’ve worked diligently for years is plain stupidity. Now what? Start all over with who? The VA needs to hire more Doctors, period. It takes a long time to be seen and many facilities do not have the people required to care for our Veterans.\nMr. Collins I do agree with you, the media are panicking veterans that a cut in benefits is coming but is the opposite all is DOGE is doing cutting cost on contracts that are being overcharge at the VA, I myself work in the retail business for many years and profits was the number one, the federal government don’t worried about profits and their productivity is the lowest. I myself don’t see anything wrong for some one else outside the system to audit and see where the money is being expend so that more funds go back to veterans. Wish the best. Semper FI\nWhy can’t the VA do electronic billing?\nThere are many many vets that are computer savy and would gladly welcome e billing instead of getting a three page statement and an envelope. Each month. For a bill that they will pay through their bank.\nAll other businesses have e-billing.\nMr. Secretary, Thanks for the confidence that our administration is taking care of our veterans! Good to see such enthusiastic support!\nGood to hear.I worried that Musk would start taking benefits away.benefits we all fought for and our veterans need and deserve\nYou put out this comment after you already know that vets have lost their jobs at agencies all over the board. That includes vets at the suicide hotline. How dare you try to continue to lie directly in our faces.\nAttention VA Secretary Doug Collins\nCared for my nearly 103-year-old proud Navy Veteran Mother for many years and dealing with the VA constantly cutting her benefits was a nightmare! I along with my sister spent years and literally hundreds upon hundreds of hours on the phone with people who were so inept, uncaring and who were being paid to do nothing but refer you to office after office as your rode the VA UN-merry-go-round. At 80 the VA determined she needed 43 hours of care weekly and at 94 cut her to 20 hours-then 5 hours- and we had to fight to try and keep even that. Seven of those years were spent being hired as her caretaker which according to the VA rules had to be done through a VA recommended agency (what a nightmare they are). They came to our home once and never came again or did a single thing after that except force me to fill out reports they sent in to collect thousands and thousands of dollars which should have gone to the rooms my husband (also a Veteran) and I had to build on to our home for her care. Mom is gone now- It took well over a month for the agency who was supposed to be caring for her to realize this Veteran who served her country in Washington during WWII had passed away. My husband and I are still paying the price of neglect by the VA and so are thousands of other families. I think the company that the VA helped steal from my Mother and us should be held accountable to repay the money they stole into and account to care for Veterans. However, realizing the slim chance of that and still caring for our Veterans, as a long-time advocates, I would welcome the chance to talk with Doug Collins! Washington actually contacted us some years ago because we have developed programs, we were told by a government official under President Trump would save taxpayers BILLIONS of dollars annually – and we have had programs ready to be launched! We could have cut government expenditures years ago and turned billions being spent to care for all of our Veterans in excellence as well as providing them with permanent jobs but the swamp does need cleaning. Please encourage Elon Musk to DOGE the VA. I would welcome speaking with him as well. There is so much to be learned from those of us who have been through this first hand! We paid a high price and went through many years of valuable heartbreaking experiences to make life better for our Veterans and will continue to do so even though my husband is in his 80’s and I am in my 70’s. Please help our nation to avoid using inefficient programs and people and ask me how our heroic men and women in uniform (especially those who are now homeless) can be better served.\nSincerely, Naomi E. Rocheleau\nFunny thing to promise after 47 just made an executive order stating you’re not even in charge of your own agency.\nIf this is true why have DOGE and other representatives of the Administration already gone on record stating they have ran comparisons on Veterans who receive disability from VA to FAA licensed commercial Pilots? Shame on targeting those who protected us\nYour lips to Gods ear Mr Collin’s but with cuts for the sake of cut that seem to be the the intent of the new administration I am afraid for all Veterans and active service persons as this administrations first term there was no respect shown for military as we were considered suckers….I appreciate the work you do for us Mr Collins and your dedication to it, Thank you.\nHow about getting rid of DEI hires that are present in our Hospital admins. The care at the Des Moines VA Hospital has gotten worse since new admin people were appointed a few years ago. Why hasn’t the Hospital in Des Moines put up pictures of our new President and VP.\nDirector of Veterans Affairs Administration,\nI live in Houston, Texas. My husband comes to the VA for all his medical needs. I came to the VA with him and notice your photo was not on the walls anywhere in that government building. I notice President Donald Trump photo was not there either.\nThe person in charge needs to take charge and display your photo and the President of the United States on the wall. The workers here at the VA in the Micheal De Bakey building in Houston, Texas needs to step it up and stop being lazy and racist. Their service is terrible.\nI submitted a request to add a dependent (my wife) it’s been eight months. Your help in getting this resolved would be greatly appreciated.\nYour request to add or remove a dependent\nReceived on August 27, 2024\nAs if I believe one thing out of his mouth. His first point was not about veterans, it was about media. Pick on the media first. So, what agenda does that belie? Tell me how that helps veterans.\nI strongly suggest that anyone with problems get in touch with a veterans’ clinic in a law school. That was the route I took when no private lawyer would take the case of my husband. My husband’s case was taken by the clinic at the University of Baltimore School of Law.\nIn a time when we have no draft,the younger generation has no need to serve our country for the benefits that are being eroded away from this administration. We have a very limited force as it is .Those who chose to serve have seen their benefits being taken away one by one. I am a former Marine and a combat veteran of the Viet Nam war. The ones who served before me in the Korean War are also on the chopping block and for what reason? To satisfy the bottom line for some moron Senator who wants to study the rats mating skills? They have for a long time put foolish requests in the budget to satisfy some stupid agenda for their personal request.Taken away from the true needs of our country and the true honest Americans who have relied on their Senators to do the right thing for our country.We called them Ear marks and pork barrel request in the past. And each year they have continued to pop up at the tax payers expense.When are they going to come clean and truly get rid of them? Or get rid of the MORONS that request the stupid things that cost us taxpayers ??\nthanks to The Department of VA affairs and Doge and President Trump! the veterans need our support and the benefits we deserve!\nThanks for the info on what’s going on in the VA\nMr Collins,\nThank you for your video stating the facts. The VA has improved dramatically since I got back from Vietnam in 1970.\nPlease continue to help improve and retain the services we all need.\nSincerely, Don Foye USN\nHello Mr. Collins,\nI’m a Councilman in the City of Campbell, Ohio and I’m also Chair for Veterans Welfare Committee. Would it be possible for you or someone from your office call me at your convenience. Some of the constituents I represent are concerned about their benefits, with the recent changes going, the mix news, media and even this website. I too have questions. But mainly I want shut rumors that are going on, that I know are not true, but feel hearing it from you would make people feel better knowing you talked to me and I can get back to the people I represent and tell them everything is going to be OK. Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from soon. My office contact is 351 Tenny avenue, Campbell, OH 44405. 330-755-1663. Or you can email me\nThank you for the update!\nMr. Collins, because you were appointed by trump I can’t believe a word you just said in this video. You claim to support American military vets and praise so-called president trump who sucks up to putin, the communist who wants to fulfill Nikita Khrushchev’s promise to burry our grand children. American vets are going to get screwed over by trump just like everybody else. It saddens and worries me that the head of the VA will help trump do it.\nGreat presentation and thank you for all that you are doing for Veterans. The Administration is living up to promises.\nDoug, I have followed your career as a Congressman and since. I truly appreciate your contributions to our country. I am an 82 year old veteran as well as a Social Security recipient and Medicare patient (parts A, B and D), and I have a request and suggestion.\nWhile there are many good people in the VA Medical Service, getting care can be a nightmare and truly exasperating. Community Care service is obtained only after negotiating a labyrinth of call trees and waiting a long time for a call back. Community Care works great for me, only after I get through the VA part of the process. In addition, I get an annual VA physical as well as an annual Medicare physical exam. This is waste!\nWhy not eliminate the VA and let us get these and all VA services through Community Care by giving me a VA card that could be used just like I use my Medicare Card and my Medicare Parts B and D insurance cards (no going through a grueling VA approval process). It would provide us with the convenience of using nearby providers and eliminate the waste of having two systems, all while saving the taxpayers a lot of funding. Those VA employees who work hard could easily find work in this private sector scenario.\nThanks for listening.\nFAKE NEWS! Don’t let any person (croney) appointed by King Trump and his MAGA presidential cabinet (not republicans) fill your head with false truths. How can I believe anything a MAGA slave to the King says. We all know the PODUS is a lier, cheater, stealer, and most of a CONVICTED FELONIST. I served 20 years in the US military, and these are not the Core Values I was taught to lead our troops. Where is your HONOR, COURAGE, and COMMITMENT to the US military Mr. Doug Collins? You sold your soul to the antichrist – Donald J Trump! And what a very lame non-reasurring video message to post to our Country’s AD and RET military personnel. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it is probably a DUCK!\nI wish they’d just let our president do his work and stop scaring people for no reason. The media is ridiculous! There’s no news reported any longer, just their opinion- and I didn’t ask for their opinion!\nWhy would we believe an appointee of Trump, the one who called veterans losers? Clearly in his revamping of our democracy, those losers don’t deserve any benefits any more than any other group he’s targeted. Although, he needs to keep the military alive and active for 1) ridding our country of all the criminal immigrants and, 2) defending against the coming coup to overthrow of his criminal administration (which cannot come soon enough).\nThis is the winter of our discontent. There is very little trust in the new administration. Defense is being cut and it appears Generals will be fired and replaced. Why would we expect the VA to be any different?\nVA Healthcare is under assault by those who wish to privatize it, i.e., to create another “public subsidy for private profit” system. The privatizers have one concern: maximize wealth and power, and have little to no concern for the health of veterans or the public. VA Healthcare works because the people involved are pursuing actions to help people while in the private sector the goal is to maximize profits.\nI should be able to contract the Secretary directly, I know he does not have time to read my email but he staff should, as a disabled Vet I should voice my concerns about the VA health care to him. The number one thing I have seen is VA employees that know matter how bad they are at their jobs cannot be fired, some of them are even promoted so someone else has to deal with them. thank you\nThank you Doug!! You are serving for all the right reasons!! SEMPER FI!!!\nWell as a daughter and wife of 100% disabled veterans I do hope we clean up the financial waste in this area so we can have more qualified doctors in our local areas so we don’t have to travel to baypines for certain illnesses. Hard to be driving around when you don’t feel well.\nMore concern to the veterans, doctors, and nurses.\nThank you Doug and good luck\nRemember these veterans did not say you have to wait when they were called why are they waiting now!!!\nPositive comment…I would like to volunteer to help Doug..I am a Vietnam Navy veteran, a retired Supply Chain Executive, father and grandfather…..I am serviced connected and in the system..\nThank you\nClean out the democRAT swamp scum. Faster, reliable, timely mail order prescription NO BROKE USPS! Fix website on myehealthyvet or get rid of it. Put Track prescriptions back on website. Re-Allow service from providers other than centrally located VA centers. Wider based, easier understood description and rationale for limits on certain disabilities. Cut the mountains of approval levels, Employ an easier self service application process for older Vet’s with lower computing skills.\nThank you . Your message was short and to the point. The main stream media is lying again. You getting the truth out to us is appreciated.\nPlease continue to share this message, as it may address concerns that some individuals have. Thanks for looking out for us vets. We need to stop the fear mongering-it will be all right, there is waste in any government organization, even in the VA-this disabled vet has had excellent service with the VA-again keep up the splendid work. Sorry for those that are having issues, I say that downsizing the VA will provide better service-it might be hard for some to believe, I have worked with organizations as a consultant in the private sector for 30 years which has proven to me that efficacy through streaming lining and UPGRADING TECHNOLGLY is the ticket-=the VA is no doubt using outdate technology.\nAnd to know those waiting on disability claims, it took six months for my disability claim to be approved, and I received my backpay for this two days sooner than was indicated on the letter so I can vouch that the VA is moving faster at this point in filling claims at least in my case\nWhy should any Veteran believe ANYTHING you SAY or PROMISE? You were appointed by a fairly elected sociopath who cannot be trusted by anyone in this world.\nAs a public servant you should not be criticizing our country’s free and open press whose diligent work has helped millions of Veterans. The press you criticize has always played a crucial role in raising awareness about the needs of veterans, particularly disabled veterans, by publishing stories about their struggles to reintegrate into civilian life, advocating for better government benefits, and highlighting the work of veterans organizations and pressuring policymakers to improve support systems for returning soldiers. Do a little history about the organization you claim to “lead”. This administration knows very little about true leadership, yourself included.\nVSO offices by appointment only with long wait times to get in still in Covid protocol. Administrative law judge hearings months to years waiting to hear cases. Veterans deserve better than this.\nLike a good puppet, you spew the same lies president Musk and his lapdog Donny vomit out of their mouths. When will anyone on the right in politics stand up to this poor excuse of an administration? The entire party is a disgrace with their lies and patronizing veterans.\nWhen Trump was president, the first time veterans had a paper which they could take to a pharmacy if they needed medication when their local clinic was closed and that was terminated under Biden as I tried to use it, and I was told it was no longer valid. It is extremely important to have that benefit because example I got out of the hospital on a Friday and let’s say the VA was closed and I couldn’t get the hospitals prescription written on a VA pad. I would have to wait all weekend until Monday to get antibiotics after coming out of the hospital for pneumonia. Please see what you can do to reinstate this benefit for veterans.\nYou can still use community care providers if your local VA is closed. I just used it this weekend. And the prescription service is still active too. I would call and speak with someone at the VA to receive clear guidance on this. There is a protocol for using the benefit. But that benefit is still available to Veterans. It was not discontinued under Biden.\nWhy comment? No one will pay attention or do a thing. I’m a disabled vet. Somewhere close to 90%. As I recall I was told I would have 100% coverage as a vet when I enlisted in the very early 70’s. I don’t have it and what I do have isn’t nothing to be excited about. Thanks to Republicans the promises made to me are just platitudes and we already went through the Republican version of efficiency once to get here. The VA is underfunded already and this DOGE bullsh-t is just another way of making cuts to the VA to help get tax cuts for the already wealthy. All we as vets are, are photo ops for the Fascist right wing and are expected to put our lives on the line for little to nothing in return because it might inconvenience the already wealthy if we’re treated like we were led to believe. I swore to protect the country against all enemies foreign and domestic and as far as I’m concerned Trump and the rest of the right wing are domestic enemies… Rest assured I’m not the only one to see that…\nDoug Collins already helped cut significant services and staff. I don’t see how we’re spinning it as a good thing. Dude is just another liar.\n60,000 square foot state of the art new facility in Zebulon, Ga. Only one primary care physician with months and months of waiting to get an appointment… help please. Thank-you.\nI should have been 100 % many years ago but have been denied over and over again. I was a combat engineer in an Atomic Demolition Munitions team 12E20 in Germany in 1966. I have had nightmares about setting off a device, killing people and team members ever since. I have PTSD Iand recognize it drove away my wife and daughter. The Army used agent purple in Germany and I have had. Many health issues. But the VA has said they didn’t have it. I have proof now I as a 79 year old reaching a point I may loose my house.\nCongratulations on your appointment. I am a supporter of DOGE. I have many thoughts on how to improve the VA and the Government, to many in fact to include here. So I guess my first recommendation would be to get rid of that ridiculous paper wasting survey and come up with well thought out questions and simplify. Last one I got I started and never finished because 1. the questions were ridiculously long and sometimes immaterial or the multiple choice answers were leading or misleading or didn’t reflect what I wanted to say. Anyway I trust you will do a good job and from what I remember about your background and time in congress you care about people and the county. There’s no doubt this department and the entire government can be better and efficient at the same time. Thank you and good luck.\nGo Secretary Collins\nThis VA leader is a boot licking Trump loyalist who has no business running this organization.\nTrumps only agenda is to sow as much chaos towards his perceived enemies as he can. That is not helpful for this country.\nTo point out the disinformation from Secretary Collins, any funds DOGE “saves” on contracts for veterans services will be used to partially offset the tax cut going mostly the very wealthy, like Musk. it’s not going to go to veterans.\nI agree VA staff has, when ever I needed to speak with them, has provided outstanding service. Although I do not use VA medical ( I have TRICARE for LIFE) I Saw the medical staff in action in Louiseville Ky. A friend needed emergency eye care. The staff stayed until we arrived and then made sure he received the treatment he needed.\nI am a Vietnam vet 1967-70 and I trust Doug and President Trump much more than those woke, inept progressive socialist democrats sucking our taxpayers money with fraud, waste and abuse. Dig in deep Collins and get rid of ineffective employees and bring back the competent and caring profesionals, di it Now.\nI’ve noticed that we have numerous comments by people with TDS or are simply the usual negative political hacks that simply enjoy complaining. Mr. Collins, I know you are a former USAF Colonel Chaplain and a man of God, and I wish you Godspeed as the Head of the VA. You will have a mighty task ahead of you to improve the socialized VA system. I certainly hope you can also streamline the Community Care system as well.\nTake care and God Bless!\nI would like to see my benefits reinstated I was dropped due to making too much income and i’m on SSA.\nI don’t trust Trump or any of the GOP members of Congress ! They have gone in a direction that takes all our fundamental ways of rights and freedoms away from the American people and put them in the hands of a egomaniac called Musk .\nSo the VA needs fewer nursing staff?\nhttps://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nI KNOW we need MORE hospital staff, not less.\n??HOW DID DOUG COLLINS GO FROM A VOICE IN THE RECENT PAST VOUING TO CLOSE ALL VA HOSPITALS??\nMy husband is a Coast Guard veteran. We thank you for this video. The media is into scare tactics. We appreciate the truth.\nMy husband of 26 years of military service was let-go. He only has 3 months to go to complete his non-probationary period. Other probationary folks are still in their jobs in the same agency. The dismissal letter said it has nothing to do with performance. Is this the response to veterans who were honorably discharged? Also, how is DOGE firing people? By draw lots? Kindly answer, Mr. Secretary.\nI’m not interested in “getting rid of things” at the VA, when we all know what you’re getting rid of is nurses. I’m not interested in your efforts to privatize the VA and its services, do not think we are fooled by your rhetoric around waiting times and service availability. Just fund the VA and give us staff for the clinics and hospitals. That’s the promise you made to your Veterans, and that’s the promise you’d better keep, because pissing off a population of Veterans is a bad idea.\nI respect the Secretary, and I believe him when he say’s our benefit’s will not be cut!!\nGood god why would we believe anything this administration says after yesterday when Trump spit on the graves of every service man who ever fought for the ideals that this country USED to represent!?! Trump just threw Ukraine under the bus and sided with a brutal dictator. All of you who support this traitor need to wake up.\nThis is how it starts….getting the vasoline ready…Jack booted thugs coming for you!\nWas the EO allowing VA health records to be sent to any requesting agency rescinded? I noticed this change when I was applying for homebound care benefits. I will not consent to my health records being sent to SS, IRS, and/or any agency that requests them, without notifying me or a having a warrant. Needless to say my application wasn’t accepted.\nThis is what they say right before they cut funding. Every. Single. Time.\nI doubt that . . .\nDisgusting mouthpiece of trump\nDOGE is a farce. Elon Musk and his youth tech hackers have no business in our veterans health care and benefits. That has been an ongoing process the past few years and it’s happening!\nThe VA has come a long way in taking care of us.\nDon’t let an unvetted, illegally appointee crush our vets.\nDOGE might not change our benefits much, but the staff won’t be available to carry out the mission to all of us veterans.\nSir,\nWhat is this I am hearing and reading about VA Disability Payments being reduced in 2026 based on the household income? Why cut what someone has earned?\nYea… They are processing claims Fast, Because they Just Deny Deny Deny !!!\nY’all think people who make decisions are even reading these comments.\nI called both of the Senators in my state and asked if the rumor were true that Veterans Preference was considered the same as DEI, they gave big big promises they would check and get back with me……crickets.\nI understand your fears and anxiety over our situation as veterans.\nBut I just don’t think Mr Collins has the slightest idea of what is written by us here and really doesn’t even care\nThis video is a joke. Let’s blame misinformation on the media not the source. This what we can expect from a secretary appointed by Trump.\nI have been turned down for service connecting disabilities since 2009. WHY BECAUSE VA HAS SAID MY PROBLEMS ARE FROM BEING OLD. I WAS A HAZARDOUS WASTE PERSON IN NAVY FOR YEARS WHILE IN\nI HANDLED SAME STUFF THAT BURN PIT PEOPLE DID. REXCEPT HUMAN WASTE. THIS IS BS. AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED THIS GOVERNMENT AND PAST CAN BURN DOWN.\nWhy is it so hard to get VA benefits for those who served in the mid-60s through the end of the 70s’.\nWell said Mr. Secretary. And Congratulations on your appointment as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRegardless, I truly believe by eliminating positions and most importantly eliminating Vets who work for the VA is not the right approach. A sledge hammer does not replace a scalpel. With a king in office who does not, and will never, respect the Military, all veterans should be cautious and concerned about the cuts to come.\nWe served the country, NOW, the country can serve US!!!\nThen explain to me why my appeal that I opened in October of 2022 is still not heard.? The system is broken and those vetabwho are waiting do not see an end of the road. Just more aggravation\nI believe in improving benefits and other things at the VA for us veterans, we all sacrificed alot to defend our country, freedoms, and the American people, we were promised to be taken care of after our military service, and there have been times when veterans had to fight for their benefit rights, and that should never happen not only did we sacrifice, but also our family members also sacrificed watching there loved deploy when we were in Iraq and Afghanistan, so improve the VA for all us veterans and do not take away from us who sacrificed for our country, as I am still fighting about being exposed to burn pits while on deployment, as well as a Desert Shield/ Storm veteran who was exposed to all that oil well smoke up in Kuwait\nWith Musk and Trump in charge i will take a wait and see .\nMr. Collins I have been fighting a losing uphill battle for almost 35 years. I was OTH Separated from the Army in 1991 as a matter of fact I was Deserted by my command. I still to this day do not understand why not one person has taken an interest and called for an investigation. I have done everything possible and I will never give up on my Innocence. Now that I am service connected disabled what is the VA going to do to help me get this set aside, and exhonrate me fully and bring relief and Justice to me and my Family? The worst part is no Courts seem to have Jurisdiction but they did not mind having me falsely arrested and held without any probable cause or mandatory 48 hr review, and sure as hell never mentioned administrative credit for that time. Why would they right all my due process, substantial, and constitutional rights are still being held hostage as POW’s. I have never in my a adult life been able to have my rights even restored to me what a shame. Maybe yourself and Mr. Trump s should DOGE a after the truth to recover Justice for me. You have the power to grant me Equitable Relief, I requested a such relief from the prior Secretary and even got an email stating give them 7 days to respond that was in N November, I’m s still waiting on that email.\nThank You\ni dont trust a word from any Trump rep — Trump is the biggest liar in the world. Russia invaded Ukraine, don’t let that liar make up new facts\nI am a four-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, serving proudly its Security Service, from 1970 to 1974.\nI will speak frankly, sir. I don’t trust you. You are a Trumpist. You will follow whatever he says, for his good, not\nfor ours. You have, and will, bend the knee. I will not. I support democracy, liberty, our constitution, and our\ncommitment to our ideals and obligations. I support our allies. I am totally against oligarchs and dictators in the\nworld, and now, sadly, here at home. The oath I took is as meaningful to me today as it was when I took it 55 years ago.\nI SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHAT HE AIS DOING TO CUT WASTE AND TO SUPORT OUR VETERANS WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY SCREAMING FOUL AT THE TOP OF THERE VOICES HE HAS TO BE DOING IT RITE.\nI have lived here in South Carolina for almost 7 years and I can tell you this, the VA has really stepped up to the plate. It started with President Trump during his first term as President, he replaced the secretary because he wasn’t doing his job and it took veterans forever to get care. Ever since then the VA has gotten so much better. The VA is a different place because of President Trump and the people he has put in place. My only hope is that the VA moves forward to keep making health care for veterans even better, please don’t cut services to save money. I am a patriot and I love this country, I fought for this country as my father did before me. Please take care of us.\nGet rid of the DOGE bros. ONLy way to have any credibility. These guys are amateurs.\nHow can we believe anything said by this administration about anything! We are abandoning our allies and doing Putin’s bidding. You are destroying America and your empty promises to protect veterans benefits is laughable while Elon Musk and his lieutenants are the one deciding things.\nThanks Doug, from a fellow Georgian and recipient of Vet benefits.\nI have been waiting 2yrs for an approval to my VA claim that the VA says is not service connected I was injured during field maneuvers in Germany and the injury is documented in my medical records, and I have been trying since 2017 to get the VA to see this injury in my medical records but they say it is not service connected.\nGreat hearing directly from the Secretary. No fake news from him!!\nSaying benefits won’t be cut is not nearly the same as saying disability payments won’t be cut or reduced. Please make another video that states disability payments won’t be cut or reduced.\nVeterans need to listen to the context of this message. It speaks volumes that no one’s comments have been addressed.\nPlease do not cut women’s services anymore than it has been in Florida. I can’t believe that my primary care physician has to be my gynecologist because that dept. was cut from the Jacksonville VA clinic.\nI already had to miss 5 months of mental healthcare because it was canceled for no reason other than I was seeing someone in the community instead of at the VA hospital. Now I have to start all over with someone new that I don’t trust who looks like she just graduated from college.\nIts good to hear from the top. The rumor mill can needlessly cause unnecessary anxiety. Thank you for the information.\nTom Bellows\nMy father was WWII veteran in Army Air Force. He pushed me to sign up with the VA after my enlistment was up and I had no idea the opportunities that became available to me. I served in the US Air Force to protect this nation and did it to the absolute best of my ability. No regrets. Proud now to be a veteran and I meet daily with veterans at the Montrose campus and we built a friendship that is beyond words. The VA is critical for veterans that gave their lives and I for one appreciate immensely all that it has given me personally. Please continue the work that the VA offers and always remember Freedom is not Free.\nAnother Leader in fairy tale land. They already cut 1000 employees. Yes, the ones that help veterans considering suicide. Why is so hard to find a real veteran to lead the Veterans Department? Got rid of judges. Reminds me of the veterans that died before they recognized agent orange did cause cancer. Old Bone Spurs is not our friend!\nthe proof is in the actions and not in his words that are unproven. I remember the former congressman from Georgia before he was placed in this position. He has made several mistruths in the public space in that later position and that was one of public trust as well. So I’m waiting to see if he is a man of his word or just an empty suit for the Doge stooges.\nOk I’m a U.S. Navy veteran who has had a claim for legitimate benefits that has passed the 3 year mark. Seems I got putting on the back burner. Would like to have a determination whether it be approved or denied. Just want to get it over with\nsocial security is not and should never be an item for discussion of cuts. its our money and congress should keep their grubby little hands off of it. Secondly, concerning a veterans disability compensation, should be provided a cost of living raise every year. In fact, we deserve more than what we are receiving now.\nWhat does Musk and his DOGE slash and burn team know or understand what Veterans have experienced or need to heal. Only Veterans understand what other veterans experience and need. You should hold the line and resist this attack on our government and support what we need. We have done what we were asked after volunteering to serve. Do not roll over to dictator in chief and his henchmen.\nConsidering the mount of damage DOGE has been doing to everything it touches, having mainly to do with the fact that Musk and his army of inexperienced interns have no idea what they’re doing, I have very little faith in ANYTHING being said here. Musk is an entitled rich doofus who has no idea the kinds of traumas and disabilities we veterans are dealing with, so he is a TERRIBLE arbitrator of what is and isn’t “fraud.” I’m tired of decisions about our care, and our benefits being made by entitled clowns who have never served a day in their pampered lives, or having some moronic DC talking head telling us that we are somehow leeches because we require assistance after our service. Like I said, I have no faith in DOGE, Musk, Trump, or Secretary Collins, and I do not believe that they will not slash our benefits.\nAre these individuals lawyers? Do they have significant legal experience? Have they been given backgrounds checks? Are they cleared by law enforcement to handle personal information and confidential documents? Is there accountability to those who are going over contracts? Or are we just expected to believe they are working in good faith? Lots of concerns.\nGood morning,\nI am a veteran (US Army)\nI filled out the form for my case since august 28th 2024 and still waiting. In today date february 20th 2025 I haven’t seen anything, more than 6 months.\nI hope they address the issue of the low pay for the VA workers and see that is why so many leave the VA. They need to Pay what the outside pays. I am not a VA Worker I am a Veteran who uses the VA\nHow about we cut-out putting Veterans into dangerous FDA/Pharma guinea-pig…I mean, clinical trials? I was a victim of said program that gave me a brief trip to the other side of the veil. That would the ceasing of Life functions by sketchy, dangerous untested drugs for all you naive types. While that was an experience, I never signed up for it.\nYou want to really help us veterans? Get rid of the WHOLE BODY RATING SYSTEM. Our percentage should be added up as a whole percentage and not reduced because of going over 100%. Make the 100% the maximum. I currently have 40,30,10,10,10= 70%. This is how the country I served for 21 years wants to short change me and every other veteran?\nEat s**t you Trump lackey scumbag. The only one lying here is y’all, not the media. Same old excuse.\nDo you really want us to believe that Trump — or any of his sycophants – have our concerns at heart? In 2018 / 2019 our town was taking up food contributions for the military personnel here because this guy executed the longest shutdown of the U.S. government in history because they wouldn’t fund his wall. This is the guy who dodged the draft by having Daddy get 2 doctors (who both rented apartments from him) to say he had a bone spur – which could have easily been corrected with an operation. this is the guy who had the nerve to call McCain a loser and denigrated the record of the late Republican senator on veterans affairs despite routinely appropriating one of McCain’s crowning achievements as his own. This is the guy who said when declining to go to a ceremony at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near Paris, in 2018: ““Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” This is the guy who called the more than 1,800 Marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. This is the guy who asked that wounded veterans be kept out of military parades. Just think about how many vets are losing their jobs right now, unable to make monthly payments, because of his executive orders and Co-President Musk’s DOGE cuts. This is the guy who is now posting on social media referring to himself as a king. Do you think he cares about us? You need to wake up and smell the roses – and stop trying to BS us. Like the entire congress, it is time for you to grow a set and stop lying. No job is worth your honor or integrity. JBK\nLet’s Do the VA Math Hustle\nVA disability ratings are based on “remaining ability,” not straightforward arithmetic. Here’s how the system works:\nA veteran is rated 50% disabled for PTSD, meaning he has 50% remaining ability. He also has Tinnitus, caused by severe hearing loss (HL) from exposure to helicopter rotors or jet engines. The VA rates the Tinnitus at 10% disabling but assigns 0% to HL, meaning it is acknowledged but not compensated.\nNow, does 50% + 10% = 60%? No.\nThe VA applies the 10% Tinnitus rating to the 50% remaining ability:\n10% of 50% = 5%. The VA rounds up, so he gets 10%, bringing him to 60% total disability.\nNow his HL worsens, and after a new audiology exam, the VA raises his HL rating to 10%. However, 10% of his remaining 40% ability = 4%, which the VA rounds down to 0%. His total rating remains at 60%—no increase despite documented worsening.\nThe PACT Act expands benefits for veterans exposed to toxins, including asbestos. The veteran has service-related asbestos exposure and is rated 10% disabled for it. Does this raise his total rating? No. The same VA math applies:\n10% of his remaining 40% = 4%, rounded down to 0%. He stays at 60%.\nYears later, anemia surfaces in his records, linked to asbestos, jet fuel, or firefighting foam. The VA acknowledges the nexus and grants another 10%. Again, 10% of the remaining 40% = 4%, rounded down to 0%. He still remains at 60%, despite multiple service-connected conditions.\nThe Real Cost of VA Math\nIf the VA used basic addition, his disabilities (50% PTSD + 10% Tinnitus + 10% HL + 10% asbestos exposure + 10% anemia) would add up to 100%, qualifying him for **$3,831.30 per month** in 2025. Instead, due to VA math, he remains at **60%, receiving only $1,395.93 per month**—less than half of what he should receive.\nEven worse, because the VA only compensates from the **date of claim**, this veteran loses decades of retroactive benefits for service-connected conditions that trace back to Desert Storm or Vietnam.\nThis is not a minor technicality. It is an institutionalized method of **Denying, Delaying, and Defending** against rightful compensation.\nEnough talk and start showing by doing what word came out of your mouth. I supposed when the PACT Act came out nothing really happened considering we have been suffering after Post 911 conditions. And with all the conditions I reported I only got 80% when it is suppose to be 100%.\nAs for education and training, there is much more to improved with helping Veterans domestically and internationally to allow Veterans to get full access if their education benefits unconditionally. Having credentials from higher institutions are not enough to get jobs that Veterans desire to do as their calling to find their new purpose in life. Do more and do better!!!\nRight off the bat we have a highly politicized attack on the press? This augurs badly. The LAST thing VA should be is partisan and trying to create a narrative to control perceptions.\nI’m a VA patient. Twenty years ago VA health care was really second rate and, so I avoided it at my expense. Over the last few years there has been obvious and substantial improvement. VA brought in much more competent primary care, expanded the quality and availability of specialty care and improved facilities. The most important thing was VA’s effort to recruit people, to upgrade staff. These people can make more money in the private sector but they choose to serve us because VA employment was more secure, more compatible with their family life, LESS bureaucratic than private insurers and because they have a more grateful base of patients at VA. Immediately upon jackass Musk’s shock and awe campaign a big chill went through, pending offers didn’t go out, applicants had second thoughts. The immediate damage will take time and effort to repair because confidence is important and the new administration has shattered confidence and trust.\nAnd what are you doing? What’s your first contact with us veterans? You are sending out political messages to attack the Press? If that’s what you think then volunteer to go on TV or give interviews to the Times and confront the press directly and see what they say in return.\nEven more chilling you want my name and e-mail. Anyone who’s been following events recognizes a vindictive streak in the new administration, I’m frankly concerned for my benefits because you seem to be “making a list”, here. But, damn it I’ve already seen a terrible change in morale and recruitment so I’ll take my chances.\nCan you help my husband a 30 yr vet ? He is trying to contact the Navy retirement office the other day they had him on hold for 3 hours then disconnected the call we can not get any help any where thank you for your service\nI’ve had a claim in since 1970 so I hope he doesn’t wait until I’m dead so that it goes away. Since I don’t know the claim number I know I can put my service number because that is public knowledge so here it is. The public is able to access this number and only access the number they can’t go any further but he can so you don’t have to delete this number. Thank you and have a wonderful day and may God bless.\n[Editor: Do NOT publish your sensitive personal information on the internet. I have deleted it from your comment.]\nApparently, Mr. Collins has not read Project 2025, nor is he aware that the VA OIG has been illegally fired. The VHPI”s take on the impact that the implementation of Project 2025 ‘policy’s’ is here: https://veteranspolicy.org/?s=project+2025\nWhat this adminIstration SAYS and what it DOES, will likely be different. DOGE may have already gained access to the VA computers. If their previous actions are an indication of their present actions, your privacy may have been compromised. DOGE was NOT supposed to gain access to CLASSIFIED data, yet managed to post it on its UNSECURED website.\nTRUST AND RESPECT IS EARNED, trust and respect can be burned with LIES. Veterans have a long history of DISTRUST of the VA for decades. The reason being – WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO, been disrespected, given the run around, delays, being treated as LESS THAN. Each new administration brings issues and policy changes. But WE ARE PEOPLE, not numbers, groups, things, actual living people who served our country with HONOR. When the time comes for our needs to be met, we cannot be assured of consistency of care. DOGE shows up and employees are told to go home, you’re fired. Did suicide hotline calls go unanswered?\nH.R. 5697 ACCESS ACT is described here: https://veteranspolicy.org/?s=ACCESS+ACT\nMr. Collins, your office sent me an email announcing your new position. I wrote back that I did not have faith in this administration to provide quality care/service. Nothing that you have said has changed my mind. I doubt that you will ever bother to read these comments posted by the very people that your department is meant TO SERVE. LIES HAVE CONSEQUENCES, FACTS STILL MATTER. Viet Nam Veterans said after they returned “NEVER AGAIN, NEVER AGAIN” They made it a point to ensure that Veterans were NEVER treated with disrespect, they way they were treated when they returned home. My family has had US military service members in every generation as far back as the Civil War. Generations of Veterans have experience with the government . This administration does not respect the military, nor Veterans. The man has profound issues with his own interests outweighing those of the country. I am not alone in reserving a wait and see attitude, as we have seen this clownish sh*t show rodeo before. When our government asked us to step up, WE DID, we demand that our government STEP UP FOR US, as we fulfilled our obligations completely. ALL GAVE SOME, SOME GAVE ALL. Our dues are paid in full, we expect to receive what was promised to us, when we raised our hands and swore under oath, to protect and serve the constitution, from ALL ENEMIES – FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.\nTHE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION WAS NOT WRITTEN TO PROTECT CRIMINALS, IT WAS WRITTEN TO PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT FROM BECOMING CRIMINALS – Lenny Bruce, Veteran\nWell Doug you’ve got the easy part done now let’s see results.\nWhat about having to close all radiology at the Pueblo Colorado VA because everyone that could run the equipment were fired by Musk/Trump. Now thinking of sending people from other VA clinics for a few days a week to try to keep Pueblo open but cause shortages at other Colorado clinics/hospitals.\nI don’t believe a word he is saying. Muskrat and Project 2025 leader and head of OBM, have already said they want to cut disability payments once we enter retirement age.\nWhy can’t people see that this administration says what they think people want to hear. Then do what they want. All you have to do is watch and listen to them.\nCollins, from my home state, is as crooked as the day is long . He will do whatever Trump and muskrat tell him to do.\nI wish more folks would take a little time to just read Project 2025. It details Everything that this administration is doing. Even though Trump lied to voters by saying he knew nothing about it. Yea right. Tried to tell folks that he was lying.\nShameful.\nThey have sent Tens of Thousands of people to the unemployment line. Tariffs are causing prices to skyrocket. Every govt. agency is being led by appointees that have No Clue what they are doing. And they have already Fired Thousands of employees at the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and Healthcare. At a time the Dept. is vastly undermanned.\n” Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it”!! And MAGA is getting just what they should have seen we would\nget. And what sux is, the rest of us will suffer for their uneducated voting practices.\nHope to God out Nation survives this Blatant move to Hitlers Fascism\nFIX Community Care. It sucks. Takes too long to set up and approve provider request.\nPlease consider increases to the spouse’s survivor benefits. It is impossible to make ends meet on the current amount. I’m so worried how I will survive if my husband passes before me. He has been 100 percent disabled for over 10 years and has suffered from his disability since 1971.\nHope your article is correct I have been waiting for a higher level review for 4 months, that’s just ridiculous. Been waiting on my C file just as long.\nThanks for the information. Sadly the media has lost all credibility with me. The one thing I cannot tolerate is a liar. As a former Sailor, liars can get you killed or seriously injured. These past 4 years the democrats and media has proven to me that they are liars. Once that bridge has been crossed with me, I will never trust that person or entity again. Never! Once a liar, always a liar.\nTrump lies every time he opens his mouth. How can we trust his “gofers”? As a disabled Navy\nVietnam vet (86 years old) I am scared I will lose my care giver, my VA meds , VA DR and housing.\nSay, could you be any further up T-Rumps behind? Sorry, I wish I could believe you but you basically addressed nothing in this video. It might as well been Donald himself rambling on saying nothing.\nPardon my skepticism, but quite frankly I have heard that all before, and to be completely honest our current (sic) commander-in-chief does not have a sterling reputation when it comes to honesty so I take everything he says with a large grain of salt. Nor, for that matter, do I place any trust in his chief minion, Elon Musk, who also has a track record for flights of hyperbolic fantasy when it comes to stating facts or telling the truth. As the old saw goes “The proof is in the pudding” and the veterans of this country will be watching closely and holding accountable this administration for honoring “The unwritten contract” that was implicitly guaranteed when we raised our right hands and swore an Oath that stated “ I, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” It’s been 55 years since I swore that Oath, and I believe in it as strongly today as I did then and I believe that the overwhelming majority of our military, past and present, feel exactly the same way.\nI amma full timem teacer with 70% V Disabiity. How will then Fairess Act effect my benefits?\n“Hey y’all…it’s me again” … Great, a week on the job and already a total lack of professional bearing. Please spare me the Jerry Falwell bumpkin buddy chat…you are leading a massively important agency. Don’t try to sell me on what’s great for the VA and our current political administration is better than what’s right for the Veteran. The American tax payer understands with the utmost respect that these benefits are the price paid in keeping our enemies out of their backyards, continuing to give their children and grandchildren the freedom of choice and expression, and the ability to sleep soundly each night knowing we have/had the watch. God help you if you are knowingly being deceitful.\nYou are attacking the media for reporting what may happen? Isn’t it their job to keep us informed. So far it seems that our government is following the Project 2025 playbook fairly closely, and that does not bode well for veterans, or anyone who relies on their government to provide services.\nDear Sec Collins,\nI live in Jakarta, Indonesia, and I fall under your VA’s Foreign Medical Program (FMP) and I am APPALLED with the poor service that office has been providing.\nFor over a year, FMP has been delaying payment of over $50,000 that they own me and have not disputed, but because they cannot or will not move from paying by checks to paying by Electronic Transfer they are delaying the money they owe me to PREPAY the next phase of treatment, approved and authorized under the PACT ACT.\nI have even sent FMP the forms being used by the IRS, Social Security, and even some VA offices to switch from payment by check to payment by ETF.\nI have been working with my state Senator from Alaska, Dan Sullivan and state Representative from New Jersey, Ms. Mikie Sherril and they have made no discernible progress in addressing a major problem that should only take days to correct.\nThank you for looking into this and if you provide me with a name and email address, I will attach the documents I have been providing to the FMP and VA.gov for over a year now with no success.\nThank you!!\nDr. PDG, Jakarta, Indonesia\nI am a 78 year-old Vietnam vet (1st Cav Div) in-country 1968 to 1969 at Khe San and Phuoc Vinh. Honorable discharge and returned home in Aug 1969. I immediately went to the Winston-Salem,NC VA office and filed for disability due to Agent Orange (peripheral nephropathy), PTSD, Sleep Apnea, hypertension and a knee injured at Ft Bragg the medical staff recommended medical operation for torn ligaments in March 1968. I was given orders to Viet Nam for reporting in August 1969. After discharge in August 1969, returned home, with peripheral nephropathy (Agent Orange), Sleep Apnea (nightly rocket attacks at roughly 1:00 AM EVERY NIGHT and unable to go to sleep until the all-clear siren blew about 3:00 AM and having to wake every morning at roughly 6:AM every morning; PTSD(Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome); Hypertension (high blood pressure); being in I-Corps originally, roughly every other day for 6 months, you could count on a Agent Orange “shower” because we were in the tri-border area of Viet Nam, Laos and North Viet Nam.\nUpon my return to the States, I immediately went to the Winston-Salem, NC office to file for my education and disability benefits. I was given a paper claim card, which I still have, and given education benefits for school. My subsequent claim(s) was adjudicated that I did not have a claim because: (1) The lost my records because of a fire and the VA office; (2) there was no records that supported my claim regardless of the fact my DD-214 showed I was in Viet Nam and given a Bronze Star; (3) they had no record of my filing a claim and/or, I had not been stationed in Viet Nam; (4) All items claimed for disability were diagnosed by VA doctors on multiple occasions, yet the copies of records were in my records and the examiners told me that my DD-214 was invalid because it “appeared” to be invalid and I could not prove that I was ever in Viet Nam.\nI finally got approval for 30% disability, regardless of the fact that every visit to the VA hospital was met with the “stick test” that clearly showed that I had peripheral nephropathy; was given a sleep test for sleep apnea and given a machine for breathing help, and other medications for the items that are indicative of problems the VA found with those who were in-country and related to Agent Orange.\nI have been referred to outside consultants for Sleep Apnea, Peripheral Nephropathy, High Blood Pressure, given a cane for my knee. With these and other items found by VA doctors, I have been prescribed 17 different medications for the items diagnosed by the VA, yet, I was only given small compensation starting in 2011.\nI have more than 400 pages of medical records from the VA, which have been forwarded to the VA Records Collection in Janesville, WI. A recent inquiry concerning my records by the Dr working with my PTSD showed there were 2034 records in my file. The following week, I called Janesville and asked them about the disparity in the number of records, I was told they only have 434 VA medical records. The problem with the scenario is the record count is never consistent. I have only used the VA doctors for my military medical diagnosis, yet, there are occasions when their record count is zero.\nWhen asked about my claim, I was told they have made progress on my claim and the representative told me that I have a large amount of money due to their increasing my claim percentage with the implication being “I would need a large bank account” to hold the back pay I would get. To date, only my percentage has been increased effective December 1, 2024.\nIt is a constant fight to get this situation resolved, as in my case, 55 years with 4 conditions that is on the VA ‘s list of compensation is nothing more than an empty promise.\nI have tried the legislative approach, using my State and Federal House Members and Senators, to no avail.\nI haven’t seen anything in the media about benefit cuts, Sec Collins. Or is attacking the media part of your new job? What has been accurately reported is that 1,000 VA employees have been terminated – about which you say nothing.\nWhy do you trust DOGE to make wise decisions on VA contracts? They are led by a mad-man named Musk who is trying to reach reduction quotas for Trump’s tax cuts. I’m concerned – and you should be also. Or are you afraid to lose your job if you encourage caution?\nYour words are full of lies. I do not believe for one second you have veterans well being at stake. I’ve been lied to so many times by the VA and I’m supposed to take your word. Your word means nothing to me. Deceit and lies make up the VA and I have proof. You deny veterans benefits at a rate that is unacceptable. The VA denied my benefits for 11 years in hopes I would die. When I’m looking at my military health records stating I was injured while jumping outta planes for the 82nd Airborne and the VA was trying to convince me it never happened. When ask after 10 if I would like the VA to make the final determination or a judge I choose the judge. Exactly one month before seeing the judge the VA called me and said they would make an immediate decision within a day if I let them. My answer was no!!! I seen the judge one month later and it took the judge 13 minutes before deciding in my favor at 100% disabled. You act surprised when we have 23 veterans per day committing suicide. What do you think is happening? They lose all hope in providing their families with food and shelter. So I firmly believe half would not be committing suicide if given what was promised to them when signing the contract when entering the military. The VA administration is lying to all the veterans and denying them their benefits for as long as they can. You know this is true. Don’t sit behind your desk adding more lies.\nMr. Secretary,\nPres. Trump’s last term included an attempt to reduce social security benefits on a dollar per dollar basis for veterans IU. This is fact. DOGE is firing people with an hour notice of job loss. How can I be sure my Social Security and VA Disability will not be lost on less than an hour notice? Is there a public presidential promise? VA i s losing its employees by DOGE analysis, are VA employees going to face minimum employment loss notification or at least, a 2-week notice? I need to know the facts with proof, not possible hearsay by you or the ??? news. Please help us believe with proof, that our benefits for disability and social security will not be lost, like a public presidential promise on the news. I already illegally lost my military career on a on a Chap 61 by contractors, after serving 19 yrs, 4 mos, and 26 days and now I am not eligible for CRDP. CRDP requires 20 yrs of service. We need to know that our healthcare will not return to months long appointments like during the president’s last term. Please, we need the proof or what you say remains haunting. I cannot afford a loss of social security on a dollar for dollar basis. The President has demonstrated his disrespect for veterans the last term, publicly against Sen McCain for being an injured POW, from my state.\nPlease don’t permit retribution to our VA benefits for making a complaint.\nPlease read and reply to all the veteran statements sent to your office. Lack of responding will lead to a lack faith in you. Don’t let the news prove you wrong, present the verifiable facts.\nThank you for your service to OUR country.\nDLHJ\nSFC, USA (forced retired illegally)\nFeb 19, 2025\nThis is the “Thank you for you service” from Pearl Harbor Naval Base…..I booked and received confirmation at the Navy Lodge in Pearl Harbor Hawaii. My wife was with me on this trip of 4 days.\nMy flt arrived Honolulu at 7pm. We drove to the base so I can check-in at the lodge. The main gate sentry told me that my wife cannot enter without a pass and the pass office is already close. He told me I can access the base with my VHIC card due service connected imprinted on my card . I turned around and drove out to book a hotel downtown for one night. Next day I drove to the pass office and got a pass for my wife only to find out that it is only a one day pass for her and that I have\ngo back to the pass office every morning to renew her one day pass during our stay at the lodge. Talk with you counterpart Mr. Hegseth to see if wounded veterans/service connected veterans be treated with some kind of dignity and respect. Hell, Guam Naval Station excluded base access veterans from their Trusted Traveler Program.\nSecretary Collin’s, Thank you so much for clearing up the issue regarding benefits.. I am a 78 year old Vietnam Marine veteran who is suffering from prostate cancer due to my agent Orange exposure. I am hoping you can help me with a question I have. I submitted the information to the V A regarding some benefit issues.\nYou will always be in my prayers for the time I have left and I am hoping God will keep you safe and guide you in your decision making to help our country and our veterans. Thank you for reading this.\nThank you, Sir for prioritizing our Vets. It appears as though this page thread is being spammed by a lot of activists. God bless Trump and the U.S.A.\nHave you lost your ever-loving MINDS? They/We/Us put a EFFing TRAITOR in the White House as a MAKE-Shift POTUS. Once Trump and Elon figure out that the Military “WILL NOT” Shoot/Murder Brown Americans. Then you can KISS YOUR VA “BENEFITS” GOODBYE, via DOGE. World War II was never even close to the current THREAT that these Domestic Enemies BURNING this country down to the ground as WE WATCH. I spent over two decades serving the US Military and America. To watch a LIFE-LONG CON MAN destroy America before our own eyes. I am ASHAMED. Trump already “KILLED” three quarters of a million Americans by his INEPT INCOMPETENT COVID Response. That’s just a drop in the bucket for what will and is DESTROYING the CURRENT FECKLESS USA. – FOFO\nAnd DC, (something tells me ok to be up n friendly with you, Doug) I took a head Hit plate in skull etc. and helping at our VFW when able to AND just glad previous vets administration is Done (no comment – that was then, this is now)! Just many congratulations and anytime you are in SE Asia let’s have coffee together with ret.msgt Janet Cmndr. Luv it. Be safe my friend.\nDOGE is already cutting jobs at the VA. I feel I am being lied to by you. DOGE is cutting jobs and benefits to people all across the government. The GOP is going along with DOGE and is doing so in order to come up with money to give people like Elon Musk huge tax cuts. I do not like being lied to. I served my country in the war in Vietnam. I was an enlisted serviceman. Please do not give me a story about caring for the veteran when you are a part of Donald Trump’s ongoing effort to tear our government apart and run it like he is a mob boss. I am sick and tired of what is going on and will work with my Congressman and Senator to put a stop to this. How dare you put out a message like this and lie to the veterans.\nThank you so much for the update Sir.\nNice. Collins is a good man\nFirst – CONGRATULATIONS Truly. And thank YOU for sharing the Truth of Our Veterans Administration svc. as this cabal or d.s.enemy, “Fake News” as Pres Trump politely calls it… Trump’s America calls it ” The LIARs’ Media Lies-Guys who spread gossips harming Our soldiers AND their families… Just thank YOU very VERY much. Luv your initials: D. C., I forward “Our New Veterans Administration Boss, D. C. Doug Collins is guiding D. C. Washington to MAGA & HE Will. Just wait n see! “\nsickening – a south African born inherent racist proudly throwing N- salutes is digging though our VA system. My great Uncle, and WWII combat veteran, rest in peace, fought the fascist and N-s in Italy. He was captured and held prisoner til the end of the war. And here we are and republicans aren’t concerned about a ‘sieg heiling’ billionaire trying to defund our government agencies so he can loot a tax break for himself. I will NOT forget what my great uncle fought for and against –\nI don’t trust anything that the President says and I now don’t have any confidence in Collins. Let’s see some action, not words/\nCollins has a track record of being a Trump yes man. So it was disappointing, but not surprising, that he gets slotted to head the VA. Sadly, as we all know, Trump is a fake military man that steals valor from real Americans in order to project power. He would never put his life at risk for the betterment of the rest. The concept of service bewilders him, but not in a respectable way. Oh, no. Service and its accompanying risks are the plight of suckers. The military is nothing more than a bag of idiot toys to to do his bidding. This is what he had to say about fellow Republican John McCain and his military service that included 5.5 years in the Hanoi Hilton “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured, okay? I hate to tell you.”\nBack to Collins, lack of qualifications aside, I was and could still be willing to give a fellow veteran a chance. He has been talking a big game about sticking up for us. But this video appears disingenuous and contrived. We are not stupid. That Collins is welcoming Big Balls and his band of tech kiddies to access our private information because it is all part of Trump’s puppet master’s plan to harvest every piece of data the administration is stupid enough to give them, tells me Collins is trending more toward lap dog than VA guard dog. Once the VA has been dismantled, funding won’t matter.\nAlso, DEI? Are you kidding? Our military and the VA are built on the backs of minorities. And the military is very good at producing disabled people, so it would seem fitting that the VA would be open to employing some vocational rehab or rehabbed folks. And give us a break on the LGBQ nonsense. I’m still waiting to hear of a legitimate instance where a service member’s or VA employee’s LGBQ status, on its own, impacted their ability to serve. Let’s try to focus on the real issues the VA faces that are obviously hindering its mission to provide veterans with the care and services they deserve and please stop wasting time fighting some made up war on wokism.\nAnother Trump shill making excuses for the cuts that have already happened. Notice the gaslighting in the phrase “media concerns”. No, they are our concerns. Trump is on record being anti-vet and anti social safety net. Musk is gutting everything to enrich himself. None of the 20 year old kids in DOGE are auditors. It’s only a matter of time.\nTime will tell if this actually means all veterans or just the straight white male types.\nHow can we be 100% sure? There is so many lies coming out of the current administration from an aircraft accident was caused by DEI to the the president of Ukraine started the war with Russia when the entire world saw the Russianv build up at the boarder and heard Russia say there were there just for an exercise, to the amount of deaths in the war and the amount of money that they have supposedly found that was fraud, to the administration cutting budget money that has been allocated any by law has to be sent for that allocation. I hope you are corrent in what you are saying, but please excuse me if I have a hard time believing anything this administration says.\nI find it extremely difficult to believe that anyone downstream of Trump is actually competent to do the job they are tasked with. Why, Trump has made it quite CLEAR he demands loyalty to himself above all others and their tasks. He has made it clear vets have little value to him through his many actions and quotes. Let’s see: demeaning Gold Star families, calling war dead “suckers and losers”, being a draft dodger himself etc. No one in his entire family has ever served either. Now we see first hand that VA systems are LOSING staff when most of the facilities are already understaffed. So how does this work to improve the VA serviced to the veteran community, of which I am a member? Sec Collin’s, I have No trust or confidence when it comes to Trumps action or word. He has proven his word means little. So, from that alone, i do not see good things in store for the current VA system. Not improvements, better budget perhaps, no I see the goal of privatization in the future. For the benefit of his wealthy handlers.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, Spineless Sycophant\nI am so so pleased that Doug Collins is in charge of the VA now. I am hopeful that things will be run more efficiently to the benefit of the veterans it cares for. Is there a way to get a letter to Secretary Collins through regular mail?\nPlease add a Bluesky link for ‘Share this story.’ Thank you.\nThis guy doesn’t realize what a fool he looks like, waving his arms, flapping his gums and using the pathetic fall-back “media’s doing it” BS. Please talk to Veterans like a human, not a tool. Do you think we’re children? “Don’t worry, nobody’s taking away your benefits!” You moron! When you make it so there’s not enough workers to handle the workload of helping Veterans get their promised health care, that’s denying Veterans their benefits. When a Veteran spends the better part of their days trying to make contact with the VA health system for an appointment that’s a denial of benefits. If enough of us Veterans simply give up trying to access benefits, that’s fewer Veterans to have to spend money on. I know I’m not expressing it well, but I won’t be around too much longer so the trillionaires can keep whatever extra pennies they would have had to pay out for whatever medical care I’d be needing.\nU lying for musk and his VP trump\nSecretary Collins, I want to draw your attention to the incredible VAMC, Boston, MA staff. I have never experienced such professional excellence, administrative genius, and remarkable decency as I have at this location. Best regards, J.L. Ross, MD [retired, US Navy]\nWAS HOPING FOR GOOD CHANGES FOR THE FUTURE OF THE VA FROM HEARING ABOUT YOUR CONFIMATION. I VISIT THE VA HERE IN OKLAHOMA. WE HAVE A CENTRALIZED PHONE SYSTEM FOR THEM HERE AND IT TAKES US TO AN OPERATOR AND THEN TO ANOTHER OPERATOR, THEN TO ANOTHER OPERATOR. FINALLY GET A HUMAN ON THE PHONE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY SENT YOU TO THE WRONG DEPARTMENT. BEFORE 2024, I COULD CALL THE CLINIC AND TALK TO A HUMAN. IF YOU HAD TO RUN YOUR OFFICE WITH A PHONE SYSTEM LIKE THIS, THAT WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF IN A HEARTBEAT! TAKE ABOUT 6 WEEKS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. THEN XRAYS , THEN MRI ANOTHER 6 WEEKS, THEN YOUR PRIMARY IS GONE AND REPLACED WITH A PA. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU FIXING SIR. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR MISSION STATEMENT FOR THE VA, BECAUSE NONE OF THE POSTED ARE ADHERED TO. THANK YOU\nSorry I don’t find this all that believable. We shall see I suppose who is telling the truth and what is hypothetical. I don’t see the President having much respect for veterans or for military service but that is only my opinion based on his past comments and actions. DOGE is a new government bureuocracy already given too much power and too little oversight. I think as veterans receiving VA benefits we have a right to be concerned about the intentions of this new administration.\nI am losing faith in the country that I served proudly. Actually, not faith in the country, but any faith or respect for it’s current leadership. I cannot understand how our Senators and Representatives, who in theory work for us, can stand by and watch this country become smaller and less of a source for powerful good on this planet. They now stand by and watch an administration rape and pillage the good will we had in the world. They watch as the adminstration disrespects the countries that have had our back, and show favor to those who mean us harm. At the same time these “lawmakers” allow disrespectful (dare I say illegal) access to the institutions of government and those that serve there. Should there be changes, and is there problems, you bet. But using a sledge hammer is sure as hell not the proper way for sensible people to address these issues. Way to indescrimate. It will be interesting when the sledge hammer hits the VA. I pray we as veterans survive this senseless and brainless rampage. Think “Kristallnacht”.\nI don’t believe this is true DOGE is gutting every agency why not VA and there is no evidence that what they are saying is true. I believe we Vets are about to get screwed again.\nThis sounds like a political propaganda video. There are cuts being made and many veterans that work for the VA have lost their jobs. How does this help ALL of our veterans. I am thankful for being a veteran and for everything the VA has done for me but when someone has to create a video praising our first felon President and a new program (DOGE) that was created by this corrupt President gives me pause.\nThank you, Secretary Collins.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) improperly awarded $10.8 million in bonuses to senior executives using funds from the PACT Act. The money was intended to retain employees in understaffed positions.\nExplanation\nThe PACT Act expanded health care and benefits for veterans exposed to environmental toxins.\nThe VA Secretary could award up to 25% of an employee’s basic pay as a Critical Skills Incentive (CSI).\nThe VA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the money was given to senior executives in the VA Central Office in Washington, DC.\nThe OIG report found that seven executives in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) received bonuses of more than $100,000.\nI will have my lawyer contact you since I still have cases pending.\nI am not a firm believer in the lies the politicians, news media, and just anybody speaking is saying. I depend on this money to survive, and I am concerned about what a nonelected official does with my income and the nation’s money.\nMy lawyer info:\nTravis Neidig\nI actually copied this from a previous comment to save me time, as I am a 100% disabled veteran who served in Desert Storm, Desert Shield, and left the military at the end of Operation Enduring Freedom. I retired from the Government job I had about 2.5 years ago, because I just could not function anymore due to the amount of pain and discomfort, plus my double vision in one eye/eye sight loss from a head trauma while on active duty. I need to know as like it is stated below, as I have sent messages to my Senators, and I get back a typical Republican statement that does not answer my question. I need to make sure my disability payments will not be in jeopardy, period. My wife is disabled from a stoke and I need to care for her. If my disability pay gets cut I will have to sell everything I own, as I have a house payment, bills, and her medical as well. I have been following what this administration is doing and I for one am worried as my pension from the government is small. You said there will no cuts the Veterans Benefits? I need some reassurance on this.\nIt’s my understanding from reading Military.com that President Trump is following recommendations from Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. While I agree with rooting out fraud, waste and abuse and think DOGE is doing and excellent job. I am fearful of Veteran’s disability compensation being radically changed! I AM AGAINST ANY REFORM OR CUTS to disability compensation! I am a total and complete 100% disabled veteran and retired! Veteran’s have sacrificed more than any other segment of the American population other than maybe law enforcement. As most retired Vets are on a fixed income any disruption to that income could lead to catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Veteran’s have earned every single penny of their compensation and under most circumstances had to fight the bureaucracy tooth and nail to get it in the first place. I beg you please do not vote yes on any bill that would include changing VA disability compensation in any way shape or form. There are PLENTY of other places to cut spending without the continued sacrifice of our Veteran’s. Thank you for your time.\nHey, Doug, what a bunch of bullsh-t. You work for President Musk and vice-president Donald Trump. They are nothing but bullsh-tters. How can you guys fire thousands of VA professional workers and expect things to improve for us veterans? Trump is a five-time draft dodger. He never served in the military. Neither did President Musk. They don’t give a sh-t about veterans; they only care about themselves and their billionaire friends. You have to do what the -ssholes tell you to do. How do you expect veterans to believe or trust you? Two of my VA medical appointments were recently canceled and rescheduled farther out. My primary care doctor is booked up close to the end of 2025; actually, I can’t even get an appointment with him. My doctor appointments are now being scheduled with nurses. I don’t care to hear your bullsh-t, which is just parroting what your bosses tell you to say. I’ll believe you when you can stand up to Musk and Trump, bring back the fired professionals, and make actual improvements at the VA for veterans and VA employees. Oh, and tell Musk and Trump to take their DOGe bullsh-t and stick it up their -sses.\nIf you feel like it is time to do something about your disability rating send me a message. Don’t put it off any longer.\nUS Army Retired PA and former compensation and pension examiner\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the potential staffing cuts at my local VA facility, which is already critically understaffed. It has come to my attention that these employees, who have undergone a rigorous and lengthy vetting process, are at risk of being reduced due to financial decisions influenced by external factors, such as the actions taken by Elon Musk and his involvement with DOGE.\nWhile it has been assured that monetary benefits for veterans will not be affected, the quality of care we receive is undeniably compromised when there are insufficient staff to meet our needs. The dedicated federal employees at our VA facilities are crucial to maintaining the standard of care that veterans rightfully deserve. Reducing their numbers would significantly strain the remaining staff, ultimately affecting the well-being of the veterans they serve.\nI urge you to reconsider any actions that would lead to further staff reductions and to prioritize the needs of veterans by ensuring that our VA facilities are adequately staffed and resourced.\nYou lie. You are posting a pro Trump video. Doge doesn’t need my info. My disability is minimal. I deserve more.\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the potential staffing cuts at my local VA facility, which is already critically understaffed.

Tell me Veterans, do you feel supported?\nHe supported the decision to FIRE 1,000 VA employees\nMr Sectary\nI filled out the form and the computer says I already made the comment and things still haven’t changed in the last eight years.\nWhen are Vetrans going to not be treated as non-citizens! The care at the Vets station is still shitty and we are still being treated like we are COVID restrictions. You can’t even go in to drop off paperwork without an appointment. The guard at the doors won’t even allow you in to talk to someong to make an appointment. I am an 80% rated DAV and had heart surgery in Brockton MA in 2007. Was put on these lifetime drugs. When I moved to my new location because of marriage I was told by the VA station I couldn’t get my heart medicines because they weren’t service related. There is tons of missing benefits here and we are treated like animals.\nArthur Christopher Tanny\nSecretary Collins,\nFirst and foremost, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT.\nSecondly, I started reading through the previous comments and personally I was shocked at the vitriol and downright hate (SCREAMED) at you and you just walked in the door. I am sure you will have everything straight by next week.\nAs some of the posters noted, their distrust of the VA and all of the red tape is warranted, taken sometimes years to get anywhere. Personally, I am a proud Vietnam Vet 68-69 and I didn’t approach the VA because I felt there were many more Vets that needed the services more than I did so I stayed silent. However, fast forward to 2021- I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer and CLL-Leukemia at the same time. I reached out to the VA to see if I could get added to Community Care with my outside Oncologist to be able to get my medication through the VA Pharmacy. On the outside this medication is $3,000 a month but through the VA it was $11.00 so you can see why I worked through the process and was successful. Fast Forward once again to 2023 my VA Oncologist asked me why I wasn’t submitting paperwork for the Pact Act benefit which listed CLL Leukemia as being associated with Agent Orange. I applied and after back and forth paperwork over months and months I received my 100% disability, for which I am eternally grateful.\nThank you for what you are doing and good luck as you dig through reams and reams of backdated paperwork. I’m sure you will be finished by next week.\nFrom a fellow Georgian\nI agree with our secretary in TOTAL. DOGE will make the necessary cuts anywhere possible and most needed to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of our tax dollars.\nSo how does his speech line up with Elmo firing a thousand probationary employees of the VA?\nYou Trumpers really know how to lie with a straight face, don’t you?\nThe VA budget is being cut and VP Trump via Project 2025 seeks to minimize veterans benefits. That covers healthcare, disability, staff, hell, you’ll probably go after pensions next. Your sick Prez Musk is in your computers right now removing people and projects and cases and accessing our personal and financial information illegally. You’re Trump’s sycophant. You and the rest of the criminal gang want to kick us to the curve and let us fend for ourselves.\nBecause this is an oligarchical coup, not a government, and the only thing you care about is your tee time. Not us. End the gaslighting. Just tell us when you’re going to remove certain services.\nTo anyone reading this: if you abstained or voted for Trump, YOU are the problem. We who voted rationally don’t want to hear your whining. You refused to listen to your libtard neighbor and your snowflake kid who insisted you were voting against your interests. He’s in there now. Think he’ll leave after four years? Ha! Fascism and oligarchy rule now. We’ll be lucky to see another election until he’s out.\nThis message is not WCAG2.1 ADA ]accessibility compliant. The text is too small to read and there is no button to click up or down to change the font size.\nHey knucklehead, they have already been reduced with the lack of hiring nurses and in other ways. Stop the gaslighting!\nLots of complaining about what hasn’t even happened and “you support an authoritarian” blah blah blah. Shut up. I’m not sure all of these responses are from Veterans, way to self interested.\nWhen are Vetrans going to not be treated as non citizens! The care at the Vets station is still shitty and we are still being treated like we are COVID restrictions. I am an 80% rated DAV and had heart surgery in Brockton MA in 2007.

The system is pretty broken and has been for decades as you know. DOGE will find tons of fraud I’m sure. Hopefully with the common sense decisions you will be able to help the VA get some efficiency!\nWhy is the government telling the VA they can’t prescribe pain medicine ? Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin doesn’t always do the trick. I’ll bet when someone in government needs pain meds, he can get them without any hassles.\nI personally believe we veterans deserve the continued assistance we require. The VA health system has been my lifeline. It has provided me with numerous treatments and medications that have sustained my life. I could not have experienced any better care even on the outside as much as I have at my VA facilities. Please do not take this very needed assistance from us. Thank you.\nThank you for VA services, veteran’s care, efficiency, and all services and funds provided!\nI communicate with the entire staff on my VA visits and I hear the same thing all the time. All staff feal they have no say in what their department needs. In the military we had the same problem! The officers have to communicate with the grunts to know what their needs are. I hope the new administration can make this happen !\nSo, reading between the lines here… our benefits are in danger, the administration is looking to cut services to us, and this is Mr. Collins trying to hide that fact so we think that we’re safe so when Musk and his goon squad do come in, we won’t be ready for it.\nI remember that NY Times Op-Ed about how our benefits package is too generous. I remember the limp-fisted attempts to manufacture consent for this. Musk and Trump think we’re stupid, and either Mr. Collins does, too, or is desperate to save his job.\nI doubt if anyone appointed by felon T can be trusted.\nRight. Way to toe the line. Cuts will come. The republicans are after Medicare, veterans benefits, Medicaid, and social security benefits. If you are working to improve the VA, then why did you allow President Elon to fire 1,000 VA workers? I assist veterans with obtaining benefits and I am seeing simple things like keeping a college attending child on the veteran’s benefits taking upwards of 10 months (and counting). Don’t say you’re improving when they are reducing efficiency and the ability to get benefits.\nWay to toe the party line.\nI have a vet friend. Who is 100% because he has a rare terminal blood cancer caused by Agent Orange. He just got a letter from the VA. It stated he was being DROPPED to 10%. His cancer is service connected and will eventually KILL HIM. Why is he being downgraded?\nThank you for your work\nWe must fill the jobs a our VA’s Hospitals across the country so we get the best care after fighting for our country as we were promised.\nOh, our data a safer alright. Problem is us vets can’t get into our accounts anymore. Read the comments on the how to sign in section!!!\nWatch for censorship here, as is common in Yahoo.\nI THINK THE ISSUE IS THE RUMORS AND OTHERS WHO ARE ANGRY RELATED TO THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nI THINK IF YOU PROVIDED AN OUTLINE OF WHAT AND HOW YOU WILL MANAGE THE VA WILL CLARIFY ALL ISSUES.\nPLACE ALL ISSUES IN THE SUNSHINE; OPEN TO PUBLIC REVIEW.\nIF FRAUD; SHOW THE FRAUD ETC.. WHO, WHAT, WHERE , WHEN AND HOW MUCH?\nPROVIDE RATIONAL FOR ANY FIRINGS OR REMOVAL OF VA STAFF.\nI AM 82. VIETNAM ARMY MEDIC IN 1966-67 IN CU CHI, TAY NINH, IRON TRIANGLE, HOBO WOODS TDY WITH 196TH. LIGHT INFANTRY.\nALL I REMEMBER ARE DEAD; IN VIETNAM OR IN THE STATES.\nIN 1966-67 15,000 KIA’S. I STACKED A LOT OF KIA’S, DID A LOT OF DUST-OFF AND MORGUE WORK.\nHOW MANY KIA’S WERE ONLY 18?? I TREATED BLIND INJURIES, HEAD INJURIES, AMPUTATIONS, BURNS.\nI DO NOT KNOW HOW COMPENSATION CAN REPLACE LOST BODY PARTS.. I TASTE IT, SMELL IT AND FEEL IT EVERY DAY. WE DID OUR DUTY.\nNOW YOU MUST DO YOUR DUTY. GOD BLESS.\nAnd you all are going to believe this guy? Wait (not too long) and watch. Be ready to act (if you haven’t started already).\nThat guy is pushing the party line and that’s to be expected. But I only see our nation crumbling around us if we don’t protect ourselves.\nFelon and draft dodger Trump, ignorant and uninformed, continues his vengeance against the federal government, hurting veterans and their families. Congress and the Supreme court must stop the lunatic, and send him to prison where he belongs.\nSecretary Collins,\nNeed we remind you that going on video for all the public to see with a bald face lie will mark you a liar and just another sycophant to the king wannabe. The administration is leaning HARD on every single organisation to make 50% cuts in personnel! VA has always been under staffed and sorely underfunded….exactly how are you planning on improving care and services….your math doesn’t add up and your dog doesn’t hunt.\nThank you for you gracious address to all Veteran’s. The VA has assisted me in obtaining a college degree in education. I taught U.S. History, U.S. Government and taught other subjects including Coaching High School sports.\nI was a Hospital Corpsman in the Vietnam War and in maneuvers I damaged my left shoulder severely and needed basically a rebuilt shoulder. Unfortunately, the shoulder never healed properly and have had seven other shoulder surgeries, plus a replacement shoulder on both the left and right shoulder. The VA has been cordial and I have had a disability since 1975. I am now at 90%. I have suffered many years with mental and emotional stress and a divorce because of being drafted the same month I was to get married. The many days away and missing loved ones home caused great animosity. The ridicules, the spitefulness, the blatant acts employers displayed with their discriminatory acts of hiring then later firing because of so called necessary lay offs particularly to Vietnam Veterans. It took me thirteen years to finally feel caught up with those who didn’t have to go in the service for many unexcuseable means that dealt with the rich and what congressman did you happen to be acquainted with. All wars are always fought by the pons on a chess board, or families are just to poor to get their son in to the reserves, national guard and of course college. I have never come to grips with all of the anxiety and the deceitfulness that I constantly received. I still can’t decide what branch of the military I belonged with. I did appreciate the respect the Marine Corp gave to the Hospital Corpsman. One of the greatest titles I have ever received is “DOC!” I am still attempting to finalize my disability to 100%. It may bring a conclusion of the four years, difficulties after the military years, and anxiety and emotional setbacks. Sorry about allowing me to sound off. I feel I have but a couple of years left and I would feel compensated for those many years of unsureity. Sincerely, Daniel R. Polad\nMr. Secretary,\nWhile you raised important points, it is noteworthy that you did not reference the current budget proposal that aims to implement these exact cuts. While I understand that media coverage may not always align with the perspectives of officials, it is essential to recognize that the media plays a crucial role in informing the public and promoting awareness. If there are claims being made that you deem inaccurate, I urge you to counter these reports with relevant information rather than relying on political talking points. regardless of our political affiliation, Veterans deserve transparency and honesty regarding our benefits and the policies affecting them. Therefore, it is imperative that you and your team provide us with accurate and comprehensive information. We understand that you are the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. As such, we expect full transparency and request that you address the current budget proposal that aligns with Project 2025’s goal to implement several radical changes to VA benefits.\nSince DOGE is currently conducting finical awareness, will VA Disability have an increase. Like when Congress voted on a 40% increase to their annual pay. Also will there be a look into revising the appeal process for disability, some vets have been dealing with this for over 5 years. Lastly , will they be reviewing TAPS? Didn’t get much out of it to be honest.\nYeah you really shouldn’t be carrying Trump’s water.\nPeople are gonna be pissed, and your reputation will be in tatters. We aren’t stupid.\nMR. COLLINS,\nAS A COMBAT VETERAN, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE VA AUTHORIZE GLP1 FOR WEIGHT LOSS PURPOSES. CURRENTLY THE VA WILL AUTHORIZE GLP1 IF YOU ARE OBESE OR DIABETIC. THERE ARE LOTS OF US WITH WEIGHT LOSS ISSUES BUT BECAUSE WE DO NOT FALL INTO THE TWO PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CONDITIONS, WE ARE NOT ELGIBLE FOR GLP1 OR SEMIGLUTIDE MEDICATIONS. MANY HAVE WEIGHT LOSS ISSUES BECAUSE OUR AGED BODIES NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO METABOLIZE SUGAR. IT’S VERY SIMILAR TO HYPO THYROID CONDITIONS, THE BODY QUITS MAKING THYROID HORMONES AND WITH PRESCRIBED MEDICATION WE CAN LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. I’M EATING 1000 CALORIES PER DAY AND CONTINUE TO GAIN WEIGHT. SO PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING SEMIGLUTIDE MEDICATIONS TO THE VETERANS FOR WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATION. I CURRENTLY HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THESE MEDICATIONS.\nTHANK YOU,\nAL LEHMAN (ALSLEHM@GMAIL.COM)\ni want to remind the President and Trump that this countrry’s veterans are highly trained and do not take it well feeliing that our government is going to try to take away any part of our earned benefits. Screwing around with veterans is a fast way to be removed from office one way or another. Also, get the Camp Lejeune Pact Act done!\nYou’d better hope so\nYou Sir, sound like you are completely full of sh*t. Just another T**** stooge. “Hit the ground running”?? Yeah, sure did—abolishing basic rights enshrined in our dear Constitution and claiming to be the arbiter of ‘what is law’ or not. Literally calls himself a ‘king’. What the actual f.\nWe certainly can’t trust the new potus, so why in the hell would we trust you when you say he’s doing a ‘good job’?? Pound sand you smarmy politician.\nI am a Georgian and Disabled Combat veteran from my service in combat in Vietnam and Gulf ! (Desert Storm).\nI offer my congratulations to my fellow Georgian Secretary Collins on his appointment. AND to my fellow vets i know this man from his campaign rallies for political office in Georgia, and he is a fine, honest man who will offer HOPE to vets for equitable and FAIR treatment by the VA. He has already addressed his intent to greatly improve the VA and I hope we as Vets can aid him in helping us.\nLike all of YOU, I await better things.\nIf you say the VA will not be affected then why have VA employees been fired by DOGE ??\nI do not believe you. I do not believe you have our best interest at heart and I do not support our President Musk and his lackey Trump. I did not vote for those derelict felons and so don’t appreciate our personal informative being given to them. My family going back to my grandfather has served in every war since the Civil War. The way this government is going, we will not be the United States of America anymore. We will be the United States of Russia or whoever has the most money.\nDo not touch our benefits or you will see war.\nPlease get the Community Centers in Colorado to approve care outside of the VA. I’ve having to pay for my care while they sit on the paperwork. Then to be told that their doctor that reviews case said no over rides the PCP (who’s in North Carolina. Haven’t seen a physical doctor since 2020 ) from the VA. Been fighting this for 3 years for care and can’t get reimbursed for treatment that I’ve had to pay waiting. They have 45 days to processes refusals, then send a notice denied for continued care on acupuncture. When they do approve it’s for 11 visits. If they allowed 30 visits for a year it would save money in all this process. Folks that have test for cancer and other serious conditions are having the same problem here in Colorado. I have been to the VA in DC and they have the Community Care call me which doesn’t solve the problem. I’ve been told by them the “Corporations” policies state they have to deny at least once a year. I have a long list of excuses they’ve given me for delays and denying or approval. Please help.\nOur benefits may not be getting cut but it is a shame that the job cuts and hiring freeze has stopped the expansion of a new CBOC branch in Las Cruces New Mexico.\nI don’t believe a word of it. Anyone appointed by the current regime is suspect at a minimum, a co-conspirator and kleptocrat in reality.\nHe’s a trumper. I cannot trust him.\nThey cut the Veteran Crisis Hotline this week. This is so necessary for veterans who are suffering from PTSD and suicidal ideation.\nOn average, around 17 U.S. veterans die by suicide each day. In 2023, according to the most recent VA data, Its around 17 to 22 people daily.\nAs for the Veterans Crisis Line, the VA reported that in 2023, the hotline received about 1,000 to 1,500 calls per day on average. The number of texts and chat messages has also increased, showing the desperate and growing demand for mental health support among veterans.\nCutting these services means more people who are desperate don’t get the help they need. It means more people will die. I’d much rather have my tax dollars go towards helping kids be able to each school lunches and veterans in great need than padding the pockets of people destroying the last fabrics of community and care we have for our most vulnerable. Tax cuts for the rich don’t benefit the great good. No one voted for this.\nDOGE is a scam designed by south African musk and felon don to screw veterans out of their benefits.\nThey’ve already fired suicide prevention counselors and other vital VA workers.\nDo not trust them. These fascist are dangerous.\nThe secretary of the VA, Doug Collins, speaks with forked tongue!! Check the Ann Arbor, MI VA. People are being fired. One lady with 38 years there and only 2 years from retirement, gone! Take his words with a grain of salt. That VA medical facility is one of the busiest in Michigan.\nthere are approx 19,000,000 living Veterans.\nless than half, about 9,000,000, are served by VA.\n(far less have P&T ratings)\nimagine if VA had them all or even 75% — they’d need 6x budget increase, as they already need a 3x.\nREMEMBER THE VA’S MOTTO\nLIE, DENY, THEN YOU DIE!\nSO YOU ARE GOING TO HELP THE VET. I AM A VET US M C 66 70 IN NAM. I GET TREADED LAIK A DOG OR WORSE AT THE V A. HOWABOUT 38 MONTH TO GET HEARING AID. HOW ABOUT THE V A LEFT A TUMER IN MY HEAD FOR 4 TO 6 YEARS. I COULD GO ON AND ON. IF THE VET CONG DONT KILL YOU THE V A WILL.\nDoge needs to be eliminated like all enemies of the American People\nThanks, good to hear\nIt’s a cinch you’ve NOT been keeping up with nor understanding EXACTLY what is happening within and to our VA! You “claim” to be partnering with DOGE … however, these teenagers have NEVER been vetted nor given “clearances” as any other government worker HAS to do. They are also NOT experts in contract development nor do they have the necessary background/expertise in budget forensics. They are ONLY programmers who know LITTLE about the Cobalt (one of the main program languages used by our government) language or HOW to use it. WE have no guarantees that they are NOT just scamming the data as there are NO apparent guardrails to ensure WHAT is done with that data both during and following their “rummaging around” those databases. You are NEW to this Department and job. You have NO ONE with any historical background to understand WHATEVER they might tell you. We know, for a fact, that they’ve delved into the SS database and have NO expertise for dealing with that data. Their claim that some 150+ year olds are still being paid PROVES they have little expertise to parse out the data in a meaningful way! I’ve no confidence in your ability to “cover” the VA’s needs given how you’ve addressed this attack on the VA data.\n100% SC veterans at the Louis A Johnson VA Medical Center in Clarksburg , WV. (VISN 5) are waiting over one year to get dental services needed in the community, that they cannot offer in house ! Only approximately 6 veterans per month are approved on the waiting list of over 100 names ! Why ?\nVerty nice shill for Trump. I don’t believe a single word out of your mouth.\nWilliam Bushey\nEx-Navy, retired Military Sealift Command Boatswain.\nyet. not happening yet.\nmaybe it won’t — you did not say that explicitly. but, if you are backing that with some kind if trust with those two. whew. but you sound like and are a politician.\nWhat branch of the service did you serve in ?\nClearing claims faster than ever seems to be by denying them. I Was at step 5 for the past 10 weeks, then suddenly I went backwards to step four and got emails that I’m going to be redoing my C and P Exams, I’m guessing to do their best to make me look like an idiot and a liar. I try very hard to get by day to day, I raised 2 kids with my disabilities and how I still don’t know. I constantly feel on the brink of losing my sense of reality and breaking down beyond the ability to pick myself back up. I don’t know how to try harder,, I’ve given it all I’ve got. I know longer know what to do. I know there are others in what seems like a desperate place and now this, now another failure. You say you’re here to help, but I now feel that is a cruel untruth . I’m going to pray for me and all of the other veterans that are counting on you.\nBrenda Grimm\nI DO NOT BELIEVE YOU. Prove it that you are going to keep and expand the VA work force that is in dire need of MORE health professionals, not less. When I can not get an eye appointment for six months at the VA in Lakewood Washington and have to go to community care, THAT IS WRONG. We need more VA professionals, not less. Tell DOGE, go to Russia to find savings!!\nut oh. now we know our benefits are up for the chop.\nThese people are straight up liars.\nI was recently drooped from80%to seventy because they said they made a mistake and keep saying bone on bone gets better what kind of doctor or human being is that stupid afer 43 yers\nNobody believes you. Of course why should we be surprised.\nHow does DOGE define “efficiency”? That’s such a broad term.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/\nClose and sell all VA Hospitals and clinics, property, medical machines, etc. All of those employees laid off (DR, NP, RN, MA, etc) will hire into the medical field where they want, filling staffing needs at local hospitals and clinics. It will either grow hospitals and clinics, or empower those workers to start their own businesses and locations. You could even give them preferential service agreements/contracts. That allows us to go wherever we want/need to go for services needed. The VA ID and SSN is our insurance card. VA gets billed & bargains with the providers, and settles to pay them. That way we find and keep our PCP, specialists, etc. No need for travel claims and reimbursements. Selling the buildings and properties will also allow new businesses to develop and put money back into the VA. Only a few employees would be needed for staffing admin (negotiations, verifiers, approvers, and logistics). Run the numbers and tell me I’m wrong.\nY’all just cut 1000 workers and you’re trying to feed us this line? Trump calls us all suckers and losers, and you’re one of his sycophants who defends him relentlessly despite that. You need to do your ACTUAL job and defend veterans with more than just false reassurances and platitudes, what are you actually going to do to help us? Hire those thousand people back and then further expand the VA’s workforce because a consistent problem with services is everyone who works for the VA and does real work is overworked due to how poorly staffed it was before your lousy boss decided to cut that many people for no good reason. Do better. Don’t let some illegal immigrant heading an illegal “department” destroy the VA.\nhttps://youtu.be/9RMzs0EplZw?si=RBEJ–KbuMUvZnmT\nIn the words of Carol Kane from the Princess Bride, “Liar! Liar! Liiaaaaaarrr!” Of the 1,000 VA employees who were cut, hundreds of those were direct service providers including those who man the Veterans Crisis Line. Many others were claims processors and related positions, who are responsible for making sure veterans claims for benefits are processed in a timely and quality manner. Therefore when you say we are putting the money to use for veterans, you are liar.\nOnly two defining forces have ever offered to sacrifice their lives for us, Jesus Christ and the American Veteran. I’m a 100% disabled veteran and any reduction or cuts to our benefits would create a hardship for me and my brothers! BM3 USCG Cold War veteran.\nDear Sir,\nI have faith in you looking after the veteran.\nThank you\nDon A.\nI’m sorry to see the VA secretary become a mouthpiece for the lies that the POTUS is spewing. I’m sorry, but he’s not worth listening to.\nALL of these firings within government institutions is “their” effort to have only those loyalists (fellow republicans) staffing them. Voter rolls were the first to be examined before the chopping began! Trump hates anything to do with the military (having stolen the one million he raised for vets during his 2015 campaign). Remember how he refused to honor WWI vets while in France during the 100th year anniversary of the war because his hair would get wet! He’ll disrespect and will take everything away from you, too!\nHow could we believe ANYTHING that this guy says, based on who he represents?? It’s so sad. Unfortunately people will find out after the fact.\nWhen will the Secretary address the issue of benefits which have already been cut? Namely, the reduced hirings of doctors, nurses and technicians throughout the 170 hospital and clinic system. The shortage is acute. The only way a vet can see a real doctor these days is to protest the medical attention of “nurse practitioners,” who obviously are not doctors.\nVeterans are not dummies. We see, as Secretary Gen. Shinseki warned before Trump fired him, that a certain faction of politicians and avaricious businessmen is doing all it can to make the VA appear to be dysfunctional and failing, so that the way will be paved for giving the VA to Wall Street. And the ultimate reasoning behind this nefarious plan is that our free hospital system for veterans is “socialism.” Capitalists hate giving away “free stuff,” even if it is vital medical services and drugs to care for the men and women who sacrificed their precious time and sometimes their health and their very lives to defend the United States of America, whatever role, great or small, that they played.\nBetter helping us? Clinics and centers are already understaffed, in what reality is firing 1000+ staff helpful? How is downsizing the Crisis Hotline helpful? How is getting rid of SSRIs and telling receiptents to go to ‘wellness farms’ helping veterans?!\nIn what reality is taxing benefits and even thinking of limiting benefits and making them even harder to get helpful? This administration is turning into a dumpster fire and regret ever having voted for him and his unelected lackey. I have more trust in the real people getting notices and emails within the VA, on ground dealing with all of this and sounding the alarm then I do a bought yes-man.\nCan you get the VA clinics to hire more doctors? There seems to be a shortage and have to wait months to get into to see one! Also, can you get the VA clinics to start answering their phones? I live in Texas .\nSad situation!\nSecretary, you say at the end “…come to see me.” I need to see you and give you the first-hand look at what this highly rural service-connected disabled veteran needs in the form of efficiency. And I can fill you in on exactly where it is so inefficient in the VISN 20 system of VHA. I don’t need to apply for a claim, I don’t need to ask for more money, I don’t need to hope that the Office of Rural Health will be there for addressing the rural veteran’s delima of the benefit of basic medical care because this division of the VHA is only apparent to the veteran in this corner of the country to be a research gathering institution and no longer accessible to the veterans that depend on that voice that separates us from the urban veteran that has much more efficient/available/more choices of receiving medical care whether it be basic medicine or even more critical, the unique medical needs of that mostly alone to the veteran and not that of the general human race. Please let me know how I can speak with you, I’ll even be glad to make a trip to the big building in DC where you keep your desk, that is if I’m even as a veteran allowed to enter that building (past administrations made it off limits in the simplest of terms where as it was easier and more productive to be invited in to the White House complex just down the street). So please reach out to me and I’ll be glad to provide some efficiency from the most western spot in the lower 48 that one can live…and loving it.\nPersonal note: I always knew the chaplain had my back in the many years I served, and it’s the chaplain once again that has had my back in recent years at the VHA, and I understand and have confidence the chaplain on the flight deck is going to have my back also. Instills confidence there is hope.\nI don’t believe anything this man says. He is nothing more than a Trump toadie.\nI would like to come see you.But ,i probably wont be the only one.\nI find it hard to believe the words coming out of the mouths of imbecilic lickspittle…\nThank you very much! Unlike many people commenting on here im doing great! I appreciate my benefits, it seems like everyone is a victim these days. If you need any help let me know. Make America Great Again!! ?\nLeave my VA and my disability benefits alone. Stop firing staff! Allow me to continue to receive the excellent health care offered me since 1975. And I don’t believe you Collin’s.\nThis could not be more wrong. VA employees have been fired en masse without cause. I fail to see how that could possibly make anything faster. Where is your integrity? Shame on you, Mr. Secretary.\nWe have been waiting many years and were told by the end of June this year. (first it was January. Hope they get more people to help sort this out.\nHe’s lying. Like a snake. This administration and all their toadies don’t give a damn about veterans. They’ve fired the staff manning the suicide crisis phone line. They DON’T CARE about us. Period. This is all bullshit and mirrors, and we vets need to stand up against those who would reneg on the promise we made – our lives for the safety of America, and they will take care of us afterwards.\nWhy are my comments not being posted as I wrote them? I thought we had free speech in this country.\nThat’s what Hegseth told the DoD…And now guess what President Elon has announced?\nIn the Philippine, they do not pay travel pay because a few file a false travel claim. Instead of punish them, they are punishing all veterans. I think if someone file a false Travel claim, they should lose all their VA benefits.\nLook into veterans getting private doctor prescriptions filled at the V.A. pharmacy.\nWe can’t see our providers because we have NO providers. Tell me what’s efficient about that. The programs mean nothing if they are not accessible and efficient. How do I know this? I’m a Physician Assistant and have practiced medicine for 18yrs in the Army and now in the civilian sector. THE VETERANS NEED HEALTHCARE and other services NOW.\nIf they aren’t going to attack VA benefits, why has musk and his clowns fired people hired to saves veterans lives from committing suicide!? From what I’ve read musk and his idiots have started firing sucide hotline personnel!\nYou are serving a criminal who is dismantling my beloved Republic in a EO coup and handing over unconstitutional power, to an unelected, unvetted, Unconfirmed by Congress civilian billionaire that has him by the short and curlies. You and the rest of his fascist oligarchs and lapdogs should be ashamed of yourself, and you’re not. You have spit on my constitution, my oath(and your own) and my service as well as all those who have served before me and continue to do so. If you voted for Fat Nixon, you are either complicit in his crimes, or you allowed yourself to be duped because he hates the same people you do. You are NOT patriots. You’re nothing but low-level co-conspirators and I wished you would feel the pain that’s coming the most. But that’s not how this works. You’ve hurt all of us equally. Way to go.\n“find things we need to get rid of…”? That’s oddly not reassuring. What do you mean? What things? Be more transparent!\nYOU SOUND LIKE ONE OF TRUMP’S HENCHMEN IN WHICH WE SHOULD QUESTION ANY STATEMENT MADE. IT’S A SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS, BUT THAT IS WHAT MYSELF AND MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS ARE FACING. WORK ON GETTING TRUMP OUT AS PRESIDENT AND INTO A JAIL CELL (WHERE HE BELONGS AS A CONVICTED FELON), AND THEN YOU MAY BE MORE CREDIBLE.\nThanks for making it clear to all Veterans.\nAny veteran that voted for the current occupant of the White House betrayed the oath they took and disgraced the uniform. Our fathers and granfathers fought a war against fascism…. and you voted for it.\nI agree hole heartedly\nyour good i support trump and believe you\nYou don’t hire a bunch hackers (including a teenager) to do audits and forensic accounting work.\nI give this guy as much credibility as I do Trump and VP Musk- zero.\nNo veteran wants to — nor deserves to — be held in suspended animation while you attempt to digest the words of a lactose intolerant Commander-In-Chief with a documented history of bone spurs.\nThe rest of us have REAL issues.\nSecVA Doug Collins is either cutting veterans benefits or he isn’t. Don’t play the game, twinkle toes.\nRestore the SIPU’s Combat Vets need them\nWho removed Paragraph G in VFR 1108.08 and why?\nBill Montanari\nInteresting. Tell me, why would there be a need to “find things we need to get rid of”?\nWhere did that money go that you will have to “put the money where it belongs …. back with our veterans”?\nCan you give a guarantee that it won’t get “lost” again? I know, there is no guarantee.\nThank you for clearing up the rumors. Additionally thank you for taking on the role of VA Secretary, this job will certainly change you.\nI am very familiar with the Charles George Medical center in Asheville, NC. My husband had a hemorrhagic stroke in August 2020. Agent Orange left my Viet Nam vet with, among other things, chronic high blood pressure that, although he lived an incredibly healthy lifestyle, caused a small blood vessel to burst in his brain. My guy, who was a very successful small business owner, a great father, a builder of all things, including a family, a business, a cabin cruiser sailboat and our current home, has spent the last 4.5 years in a bed, having been robbed of all his gumption and motivation, not to mention the use of the left side of his body. He’s a shell of the man he used to be.\nIf it wasn’t for the Asheville VA and the amazing and dedicated employees and support staff, helping to guide us through the complicated morass of the system we would not still be in our home, I’d probably be in the hospital and my husband would probably be in a substandard hell hole of a “nursing home”.\nHow dare you and your commander and his ilk be so damned cavalier with the futures of the men and women who kept you and all the rest of us safe by offering up their own lives in service. How dare you fire the very people who make so many veterans’ and their families’ lives more liveable!\nEvery damn single employee (or volunteer) we have encountered at the VA medical center is there because they CARE and appreciate the men and women who serve/served this country. We do not need less of them, we need more! I feel very fortunate that my husband received his disability rating (a year after initial application), I am being compensated for being a full time caregiver (a year after initial application) and that we just got major funding for a converted van (a year after initial application) that my husband can drive his wheelchair into and we can actually TRAVEL to the VA again. We hope to go visit our daughter and other family members now!\nIt was the dedicated workers through the VA who made this happen for us. We are grateful every day for them. They, like the Capitol Police officers, should be held up in praise for the sacrifices and dedication they have made for us. WE NEED MORE OF THEM.\nIf you want to eliminate WASTE, start at the top, with the commander in chief and the unelected Elon Musk lording over the DOGE.\nHow long will you continue to lie to our faces!\nStart answering the 100s of questions posted here instead of continuing Trumps big lie!\nIt’s about time I am a combat wounded from the operation desert stormn/shield seen combat and got danger pay and over seas pay and got the combat action war ribbon but not a combat action badge why not thank you joseph\nDon’t believe a word this man says. He is Trump selected.\nWhy does the VA play with my percentage? every time I have had an evaluatuion they may give me an increase in the area of concern at the time, but decrease the percentage on a prior evaluation percentage.\nSo….. I call B.S. Sending Vets out in the community isn’t “improving Veterans care…” In the 21 yrs I’ve gone to the V.A., I’ve never had a bad provider. If you think waiting to be seen would be better, try calling a civilian provider for an appointment and see how far out they are booked. The V.A. is well versed in matters specific to Vets, like Agent Orange exposure, etc; that civilian providers (especially those with no military service background) are not experienced with. The contract with those who defend this country is based in part by the country providing care…it’s one of the reasons we take so much less compensation then our civilian peers. Pushing us out to the civilian community is just a ‘passing the buck’ play of shucking that responsibility.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins The VA is already trying to cut my disability benefit by 10% and deny me benefits for PTSD (even though I provided a buddy statement from my commanding officer who also served as VA Secretary), TBI and presumed exposures to cons diesel fuels etc\nLooking forward to the improvements and increased focus on Veterans!\nThank you for the update !\nWe are supposed to trust your word? I didn’t cripple myself in order for fascists could take over our government.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins The VA is already trying to cut my disability benefit by 10% and deny me benefits for PTSD, TBI and presumed exposures to cons diesel fuels etc\nIs he seriously defending Trump & Musk?? They are both destroying the country and firing numerous government workers including Veterans and closing entire government agencies and Doug Collins says Trump & Musk are doing a good job! Maybe it is because he is afraid of losing his job and then again maybe he actually believes what he is saying, but Trump & Musk are destroying our democracy right before our eyes and people like Doug need to face reality because I just heard on the news that Musk is coming for The Pentagon next!\nDoug Collins I am very disappointed in you!!\nHow can we be sure that you are truthful? Certainly, the president isn’t as well and is not being transparent. How can we trust you when you believe in him?\nI am a 90% unemployable disabled Army Veteran. I am also 63 years old. I fought tooth and nail and struggled for years to receive my rating. To cut my compensation would truly put my wife and I in jeopardy. The VA has been helping me and my wife now that my rating has been increased. I have VAHC and she has CHAMPVA that helps us with our medical care.\nI have faith in Pres. Trump and Elon Musk to cut government fat. I was shocked to see what USAID was spending on other countries under the title of CHARITY. That money could go to homeless vets or programs for Americans.\nMr. Secretary I have confidence in you and your office. I trust you are fighting for the Veteran along with Sec. Hegseth and Pres. Trumps team.\nHorse excrement. I was at my VA clinic today – there is a nurse shortage AND A HIRING FREEZE thanks to your buddy the S. African fraudster and his little band of DOGEbags. Congress already woefully underfunds the VA to serve veterans and now the hiring freeze..?\nYou’re a liar, sir.\nNEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF BOYS! AND HE WORKS HARDER THAN THE LAST 5 ADMINISTRATIONS PUT TOGETHER. NO MORE FUNDS FOR DUDS.??\nOne week on the job and Collins is already attacking the media who is trying to report all the cuts this administration is making. Collins is lying, they have already fired all the provisional VA hotline workers.\nBS. I was at my VA today – there is a nurse shortage and now a hiring freeze. So even if you were telling the truth the VA is woefully understaffed to serve veterans properly. And that is on the Congress. Call your buddies and call OFF the foreigner and his DOGEbags\nYour comments are all in present tense. You do NOT affirm that benefits will not be cut in the future.\n1000 VA employees were cut. The VA was already understaffed. Where are we when VA staff retires?\nOur new VA secretary is an obsequious Trump toady . I watched the video. No explanation about the 1,000 employees who were fired last week. Plus a half truth about DOGE. We don’t know if they’ve taken VA patients information – yet. But they already have every US citizen’s personal info following their raid on the US Treasury. Yes, Project 2025 plans to cut your benefits. The way I see it, the plan is to annoy you into giving up by having you constantly re-verify your disability rating, plus some services will be made unavailable to you. I’m sure the new Secretary is going to be OK with that. A lie by omission is still a lie, Chaplain Collins. Proverbs 19:9 A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will perish. Oh, and remember Mr Secretary, If you “hit the ground running”… You’re more than likely going to trip and fall on your face.\nI don’t believe anything that Trump, Musk, or any Trump appointed person says right now. Trump said one minute that Medicaid wouldn’t be cut. An hour later, it was announced that Medicaid would be cut. Firing employees at the VA doesn’t say to me that the cuts are meant to provide better services. It’s the exact opposite.\nA tax on is a cut. A reduction in COLA is a cut\nI am in the same boat with others for my Pact Act retroactive claim.\nDoug Collins on the job one week and he’s already attacking the media. This guy is getting ready to cut benefits, all the while lying through his teeth about it.\nAnd when will something be done about Fort MacClellan. All the chemicals we WACs endured. No one has helped. Sad sad sad yes we are getting old and death has knocked at many doors. Are you waiting till only two are still alive?\nYikes, the wording in this is so concerning. Another pandering to the corrupted leadership. Sure, they won’t do this or that….then proceed to do exactly those things. I’m not holding my breath.\nDEI removal from various VAs already making the staff take down anything dealing with Black History, LGBTQ+, and Woman Veterans says it all. The illegal “promises” of paid leave so you won’t just get fired later is all a joke. Then, not stopping the hate given from old, hateful, brainwashed salts to various minority groups that are also Veterans like themselves is just sad. What happened to this supposed comradery?\nAll of us Veterans served to preserve the freedom we ALL enjoy in the U.S.A., or is it just for the straight white males? This whole video makes me disappointed in the appointed Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\nThere are a lot of individuals below that worded it just so excellently. I will be submitting complaint after complaint to all the various offices until shit stops going backward in time. Even before all of this, it was and still is a full-time job to babysit the VA into doing what it is supposed to do. Several VHA Directives were broken, and lies were spouted. If the military had not messed me up, I wouldn’t be dealing with this organization but here we are.\nIs he seriously defending Trump & Musk?? They are both destroying the country and firing numerous government workers including Veterans and closing entire government agencies and Doug Collins says Trump & Musk are doing a good job! Maybe it is because he is afraid of losing his job and then again maybe he actually believes what he is saying, but Trump & Musk are destroying our democracy right before our eyes and people like Doug need to face reality because I just heard on the news that Musk is coming for The Pentagon next!\nDoug Collins I am very disappointed in you!!\nI was told VA is cutting benefits for tinnitus patients. This was alarming. I do suffer from tinnitus but when I had my hearing tested at the VA in Houston I wasn’t tested for tinnitus, I was tested for hearing damage starting from my separation date. After 6 years working on fighter aircraft I have to ask twice, turn the volume up too high for others and other issues not associated with tinnitus and in conjunction with tinnitus. If my disability benefit is cut, so be it. But reading this article seems to conflict with what I was told. So thanks.\nSo why are VA staff members being fired for no reason? That’s not lawful, what about the families of those employees?\n“Trust me, I’m the president”\n“I’m not a crook”\nThings to remember.\nI don’t trust you Collins. I hear that anyone who obtains a position like yours has to state that the 2000 election was stolen in your interview. I don’t trust that sociopath Musk and I damn sure don’t trust that draft dodger Trump. Trump is an amoral unethical dishonorable liar, convicted felon, corrupt businessman and politician who sexually assaults women.\nI hope that what you’re saying is true and that they won’t be taking away veteran’s benefits, for your sake and mine. Because if they do, Oh boy. I can’t even imagine what 5 million veterans, their families, active service members, and the people who support us would be willing to do to wrench that back from a despotic regime. The second you do that, the second a coup starts. Good luck getting the military at large to support you.\nSo much waste. Like paying to ship insulin overnite and it takes FedEx 3-4 days to get it to the veteran. Most time ice pack is warm. Putting the Dexcom transmitters with prosthetics . And then trying to call and ask for refill. No body at VA answers phones. Or returns a call.\nHopefully you’ll go back to letting vets go to outside resources when the waiting list is to long for care.\nThis is how it was done during President Trumps first term and veterans loved it.\nPlease go back to this exceptional resource.\nThank you Secretary Collins\nVetnam vet my records were cleaned came home 1968 they keep denying me veterns affairs needs to get fixed\nHow about helping Veterans who served Honorably instead of Denying better percentage rates. Trillions if dollars go over seas, and billions went to illegals, but Veterans get denied.\nThe secretary can’t guarantee that. How can we trust what the Secretary says, in any case?? 8% cut at the Pentagon and veterans are getting fired so who’s to say that benefits won’t be next in the spring?? You can’t guarantee that Secretary, now can you? Chaos is all that we’re seeing and no promise lasts 5 minutes around here…\nRhank you to all of those trying to make things better !@\nPlease make the VA Insurance considered “ credible” under Medicare guidelines so we can quit paying $180/ month to stay qualified for Medicare without penalty if the VA ever drops veterans currently under VA insurance\nWhy did they cut the Hotline for veterans that had veterans who were thinking of suicides calling in?\nYou are working for a person who lies and is not concerned about the American people let alone the veterans who served this country for the freedoms we all enjoyed no matter what political party you belong. This is a person who had called veterans who were MIA, captured or killed, losers when he never served in the military. How can we trust you to protect our veterans when we can’t trust the person you work for. Will you have the guts to stand up to him and his ridiculous side kick ?\nI hadn’t heard the rumor that benefits were being cut. I DID hear that most of the layoffs at the VA were veterans. Is that true?\nStaffing at my assigned VA Medical Center was already short staffed and personnel cuts will be devastating. I saw my primary doctor at the Baltimore Medical Center in December, when two lumps were found on my throat. She recommended that I be seen by an ENT specialist. However, the earliest appointment I could get is March 4th. Three months to address something that could be very serious in unacceptable. The first week in January, I was referred to physical therapy for lower back pain but the earliest available date is February 25th. I also asked if I could go through Community Care to have my therapy done locally because I live an hour and fifteen minutes from the medical center. Previously, it was quickly approved for another problem. However, this time it was quickly denied. So, at this point, it surely doesn’t seem like money and staffing is being directed to better Veterans health care.\nYou are working for a person who lies and is not concerned about the American people let alone the veterans who served this country for the freedoms we all enjoyed no matter what political party you belong. This is a person who had called veterans who were MIA, captured or killed, losers when he never served in the military. How can we trust you to protect our veterans when we can’t trust the person you work for. Will you have the guts to stand up to him and his ridiculous side kick ?\nAs a mouthpiece for the man who is carving up our civil services and selling them to his toadies, things already weren’t looking great for you. Then you put out this video lying to our faces when we can read exactly what the executive orders say and we know VA staffing, budget, and benefits are being attacked. They’re even floating taxing VA benefits as income as if that were a sane idea. You ought to apologize to us and wash your mouth out with soap. You ought to resign. I’ll thank you to at least stop lying to my face.\nI’m in Spokane where they have been trying to “fix” the new computer system for the past 5 years. If you need a place to flush more money…I’ll take it. The system should have been scrapped years ago. It was to work the day it was paid for and still has problems. Veterans are tired of reporting them as it seems no one cares.\nI Do not trust a draft dodger or a legal alien musk digging into our personal business like soc va and our personal bank accounts veterans deserves better than this.\nI have been fighting the VA since 1969 to have my disability upped to 100%. The most they will grant me is 90%. I have a bullet in my back, and scar tissue from the base of my skull down my back to just above my butt. I also have a scar just behind my left ear and numbness on my hands and both feet un into my calves. Most a bullet logged in my back that somewhere in the paperwork went from be recognized as a bullet to shrapnel fragment. It clearly shows a bullet on my x rays. The VA refuses to understand that I have serious health conditions and continue to ignore my doctor’s letters and medical records. DEALING WITH THE VA especially NOW is horrible and because of the strain it puts on my health I have to step back and keep quiet. There isn’t any hope of help from the VA especially with tRUM P AND musK IN OFFICE.\nAnother Trump shill following his marching orders in fealty to draft-dodging lying Trump. Nothing but bold-faced lies from another radical right christian nationalist on a mission to implement Project 2025, which was the intent all along. I think we’ll soon see Veterans medical services handed off to a private corporation that will only give veterans less service for more money.\nI hope you do I was treated for cancer I did not have 6 months of 3 kind’s of chemo and my primary care doctor told me to shut up about it also severed my lyranex throat has a hole in it\nWhy should we trust anything anyone from this administration says about anything? Going by previous history, none of you cab be trusted.\nThere is no way the VA will operate as efficiently as it should when you fire thousands of employees without doing due diligence and without having invested the time to understand the processes.\nThis is reassuring. However, at Charles George in some clinics long awaited doctors in the employment process ready to join a clinic are having their commitments cancelled. Doctors needed to provide long needed care where the need has for a long time out weighs what can be provided.\nI wish I could believe this guy.\nVietnam vet here. I volunteered to serve, unlike your draft-dodging blustering bully of a President. VA workers are ALREADY being fired and you have the utter gall to gaslight about “improving services.”\nYou are a disgrace and should resign. With all due respect, f-ck off.\nI try to utilize myhealthyvet but cannot figure out why I can’t make progress with any issue that arrises. I got a n assistance with try to find records within the new sign-in processes, and with the assistance was able to get some things to work but during the 5 month process, have lost the myhealthyvet account Username and password to the account itself. The system says my account has no username or password on it.\nHow can it determine the file is there if when requested it says neither item exists??\nI do not want Trump’s goons hacking my email for their filthy N- political messages. Now they want to politicize VA. None of the cowards served, but they’ll suck on the blood of those of us who did. I don’t want Collins hacking my email for his N- agenda, Now I hate Trump and his goons worse. Get out of VA.\nConsidering the manner in which all this CHANGE is taking place and the commotion it is causing, there better be something really noteworthy on the horizon.\nChange for the better is good but the manner in which it is being undertaken is questionable.\nI don’t believe Mr. Collins. When the VA has been understaffed and underfunded for at least 50 years, with reports of “probationary staff” at the VA are being fired, and with current difficulties in getting timely appointments, I have serious trouble believing that things are improving. I can imagine VA staff is having a hard time wondering who will be fired.\nWith p47’s past comments about veterans being losers and suckers, I don’t believe he or anyone in his cabinet will make the veterans’ situation better.\nGerald K. Ambroson\nThank you Mr.Secretary and Congressman for your video and straight to the point, no bs regarding the rumors that gets amplified by those using scare tactics. I served 30 years in our Armed Forces, served 1 year with the VA and soon realized to many didn’t live by the creed of President Lincoln’s promise during his famous Gettysburg address. I have also served 11 years as a DOD government employee. Yes those rumors travel fast and many retired military and active duty personnel hear these rumors and I appreciate your video and your words addressing the rumors!!\nYou lost any chance of getting respect from veterans when you allowed Elon’s baby N-s into the VA and gave them access to the computer systems. Congrats on being on the job for only a couple of weeks and already losing the trust of the people you claim you are here to serve. If you are doing anything under the “leadership” of a certain hitler wanna be, then you will never get an ounce of that respect back. YOU ALLOWED THEM TO FIRE 1,000 employees right off the bat, and you think we trust you?\nWhat a crock of trump.\nI don’t believe this sh-t in the slightest.\nThere is nobody associated with the fat orange felon that can be trusted.\nI’m rich, I’m a 0.43 percenter, so I really don’t care if I get my 100% disability each month. Maybe all of you out there should have been a little more financially responsible while you were wasting your money on nonsense.\nThank you for your commitment.\nThank you Secretary Collins for reassuring Veterans that our hard earned benefits are safe under the leadership of President Trump. However, like a football game we are only in the 1st quarter. I continue to be concerned until the 4th quarter. I have heard about 1,000 VA employees (many Veterans) being fired with little or no notice because they were recent hires. The VA must take care of its workers who in turn take care of its Veterans. Please continue to place our Veterans, some [other than me] who have given so much, first. (2/327th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, Vietnam)\nSir, yes you are clearing cases, but not in the favor of the veterans at all, just the VA. Please don’t try to tell us different! Apparently your office doesn’t answer any questions, as I’m seeing from others. 2 weeks, Sir we’ve been dealing with the bullsh-t longer than that. Ugh!\nAs a veteran,as well as someone who worked at the county level of the VA helping vets with claims and benefits, why would I believe anything he had to say. He is appointed by trumpthefelon, obviously from his statement on DOGE he is giving access and is cooperating ! They are gearing up to privatize the VA health care which IS NOT in the best interest of veterans! How in a week on the job he can say they are “clearing cases faster than ever” is s beyond me! That statement alone sounds exactly like trumpthefelon’s boasting words! It’s a sh-t show that will just continue to get worse .\nCould you clarify for me how many civil service employees received letters that they might no longer be employed by the VA and what this mix of personnel looks like. You may be processing claims more quickly but are service members getting the care they need or are they being farmed out to civilian providers with 6-8 week wait periods? I am a veteran of 28 years service with a disability. I receive my care through Medicare and Tricare for life due to issues w the VA availability of care. It isn’t much better w Tricare for life as the majority of referrals go to outside agencies. The service members and their families are then on their own to find a provider. We called that turfing patients when I worked in health care. Seems there is still a lot of it going on.\nYou did not address peoples concerns about loss of benefits-you shoved it off to an irresponsible media. That is not what I, as a veteran, want to hear.\nV/R\nDoug If the V.A is working faster than ever I would like to know why my higher appeal for care givers has been sitting on someone desk since Nov 2023. And im still waiting for it to be asign to someone . My Husband is a Vietnam Veteran . And was wounded in vietnam shot by is own lieutenant is 90% he has went down hill. For any verteran are family to wait a year is ridculous.\nYou Sir are, full of horse sh-t.\nFirst day in office Trump fired bunch of VA primary care physicians. My primary was one of them.\nIt has been 4 weeks and guess what, that number has surpassed 1000+ fired VA employees. Most of them are Veterans. Veterans taking care of other Veterans. And you’re here making a short video promising what? That our hard earned benefits aren’t going to be cut? Are you all there? Do you have any clue what’s going on in the government?\nThere is combat Veterans being deported because ICE doesn’t care about documentation. Trump just want numbers. And you sit here and right out lie that our benefits aren’t going to be touched? They are already touched. From fired primary care physicians to veterans working at VA hospitals. The VA has already been affected massively even if it was a huge ordeal to Veterans just dealing with VA to begin with.\nYou’re a schmuck and a bootlicker.\nWhy should I believe you….\nSo that it’s clear, Project 2025, which Donald Trump has followed to the letter thusfar, has plans in place to fully privatize the VA and strip us of our benefits. The method they’re using is identical to how they systematically destroyed the Postal Service last time they were in office. If you are reliant on your veteran’s benefits for your medical care, housing, income, or otherwise, you NEED to have an alternative in place for when they do to veterans what they’ve already done to farmers. I could frankly care less about what Mr. Collins says. Also, you need to be resetting your credentials in all of your VA-related websites; Vice President Musk’s kindergarten class had no business being anywhere near our personal data, and you should expect to have that information leaked or spilled, so have resets on standby.\nStep 1, Cut 1,000 employees from the VA. Where did I get that info, https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nVA Secretary is a full blown MAGAT.\nThis message from the boss seems to be contradicted by the notice I got yesterday that our Radiology location was closed down. I am not calling Mr. Collins a liar but don’t like the smell of this.\nI have a SDVOSB that service my fellow veterans!\nSecretary Collins,\nIf the VA is expanding benefits for Veterans, why did the personnel working on the Burn Pit Registry get terminated from their jobs? Why are no hiring actions for new healthcare workers moving forward? I see lip service, but no substance behind your words. Actions speak.\nWill a rating that is based on “presumptive findings” be across the board? I have a condition that gave me a rating due to harmful/toxic chemical exposure, but that same exposure didn’t cover other conditions like it should have. Will these conditions be re-considered? I have an appointment with my local VSO on 2/28/25. Will they know of the improvements that you speak of Mr. Collins? Is there a direct line/email to contact you? That would be great!\nI do not appreciate the new VA Secretary blaming the media for his inability to control the narrative on his agency. The media’s role is to report what it’s told frkm credible sources and journalistic standards require two verifiable sources. I only listen to and read media that follows these journalistic standards. I and my father are both retired military officers with high disability ratings; he was 100% and I’m 70%. He and I both served to allow free expression and a robust media to openly report important issues that inform the American public. This demonizing of the media is dangerous and un-American. I deeply resent the VA Secretary, who is suppose to represent and care for military Veterans who have been disabled in the the service of American ideals, to actively tear down one of foundations of our Democracy. I have personally read about the recent disgraceful suggestions of lowering some disabled Vets ratings assuming that only those disabilities received directly as a result of combat are worth compensating. This ignorant and disrespectful idea was obviously made by someone who has probably never served as it shows a complete lack of understanding of what it means to serve and the sacrifices all military members, and their families, make. Considering how little respect the new Secretary has for the fundamentals of a free and open Democracy, regardless of how difficult it might make his job, makes me believe he would support these suggestions as he seems just another puppet of an administration who also has very little respect for military members and the job they do. I an very disappointed, but not entirely surprised, that a man with these credentials and opinions has been named VA Secretary. After listening to video, that was somehiw meant to reassure Vets, I convinced that he cannot be trusted.\nYou Are A Lying Simp — 1000 VA Workers Just Got Cut, from DOGE — Many of these workers are Veterans, but you choose to spit in all our faces.\nNow if we can just get medical care sooner then 3 months from making an appointment. I don’t know how anybody thinks the VA had gotten better cause it hasn’t\nUnfortunately, any complaint or comment that is attempting to elicit a response will more than likely fall on deaf ears:\n“The comments section is for opinions and feedback on this particular article; this is not a customer support channel. If you are looking for assistance, please visit Ask VA or call 1-800-698-2411. Please, never put personally identifiable information (SSAN, address, phone number, etc.) or protected health information into the form — it will be deleted for your protection.”\n[Editor: I’ve removed eight SSNs from comments just this morning alone.]\nThis is who you all voted for so shut up and deal with it! He told you all exactly what he was going to do but I guess because you’re white you thought you were exempt lol! We could’ve had Kamala!!!!\nI am the 92%!\nWhy are VA employees, including health care workers, being told they should find other employment? I have been getting great care at the VA, but am disturbed that DOGE/OMB/Trump/Musk sent every employee an e-mail telling them they should terminate their employment with the VA. Note, my niece is a VA pharmacist and got the e-mail encouraging her to leave. Healthcare workers are hard enough to recruit as it is, why encourage them to leave? Note, my general impression from my VA hospital is that the workers are paid less, but the work atmosphere is better: less pressure to bring in revenue.\nSo glad you’re in charge of the VA, the quality and customer service and response time has suffered over the last 4 years.\nMake this website more useable. This thing flies you all over the place except where you want to go!!!\nWith all due respect, Mr. Secretary, you are gravely mistaken about DOGE and their actions. I urge you not to mislead our nation’s veterans with false information. Take a closer look at the insidious activities DOGE and the mastermind behind it are orchestrating within the federal government. Our veterans deserve the truth, and something ominous is on the horizon for them.\nThe VA could save a lot of money by allowing veterans to opt out of appointment reminder notifications sent by mail. Personally rarely ever arrive prior to the appointment.\nDr. Hunter R Novak, AD2\nThank you Mr. Secretary. Those of us that use the system, know all too well the deficiencies that exist, and I suggest to you, please visit with veterans and hear us out. I also support the elimination of dei. It is rampant within the VA. Good luck to you sir, and visit Houston sometime soon.\nI don’t believe a word of it\nSecretary, you’ve been there a week and already the VA is doing better, processing claims faster. Do you think we’re stupid! You have a credibility issue! Are you firing staff, or is the unelected DOGE bypassing your authority? Operating so much better while DOGE does its work? Come on!\nRun the VA appropriately, leave your political bull out of it.\nI guess he thinks he can bull sh-t us. My disability rating claim is stuck at step 3 since August. But Doug can fire 1,000 hard working, tax paying VA employees and delivering faster than ever? Who does he think he’s kidding. This guy doesn’t have two functioning brain cells to rub together. He’s as clueless as the rest of this administration’s picks. If\nI’m lucky I’ll get to keep my current rating but I think these guys are going to try to screw us over. Remember his boss thinks soldiers are “Suckers” and “Losers”…\nNo, the “media” is not the problem. I’ll take good investigative journalism over the nonsense you just spewed any day. Your video message was so unprofessional it was like if you think your audience are a bunch of brainless knuckleheads who can’t think for themselves. We deserve much more respect than that. Try again.\nI claim has been on APPEAL FOR FIVE YEARS. I am still waiting, Can you please help me!!!!!\nTypical leadership-speak that happens before budgets are cut. The VA Secretary doesn’t control how much the VA receives, others do. Usually it’s Congress, but it seems to be DOGE now. In either case it’s 20-25 year old staffers, who lack meaningful experience, that do the detailed work. So, (all too many) cuts will be made in the wrong areas.\nBeing a “company man”, the VA Secretary ultimately will proclaim success, stating: waste was cut; money was saved; efficiencies were achieved; and service was improved. As evidenced by his video address, Secretary Collins knows this is how it will play out. But only the part about money being saved will be true. But don’t blame Doug Collins – he isn’t the one swinging the budget axe.\nMore bull sh-t from one of Trump’s inexperienced hired goons!\nI do not BELIEVE ANYTHING this administration says at all, musk and his vice president do nothing but lie and these spineless republicans do not even push back, when are they going to realize that they need to stand up to him ,he is not God or a god musk and his co-president are going to ruin this country we fought for our country that more than these 2 clowns can say!!!\nHow do I get a meeting with him. And can we get a X weekly town hall meeting\nSince we are accommodating everyone nowadays let’s award Desert Storm Veterans with a Purple Heart for combat. I mean the VA did acknowledge toxic exposures from this war by creating the PACT ACT. Let’s get the Purple Heart approved for those respiratory conditions caused by the Khamisiyah bunker explosion and release of sarin gases. Not to mention the chemical attacks by Saddam Hussein’s army or were those M8 alarms imaginary?\nWe need more wheel chairs at the VA hospital in Miami,that we can roll ourselves when we have several appointments the same day, because mobility transportation is too slow picking you up from your appointment and taking you to the next.\n2. All Veterans need full dental treatment. It’s a Shame, that because you are not 100% you can’t get it. You should help all Veterans regarding of your persentage.\nAre we supposed to believe this Trumper? The Trump administration is running on nothing but lies! Trumper said he would not touch Medicaid, now Congress is going to do cut it, and he approves it. Lies, Lies, Lies!\nHi,\nI recently requested a review of my 10% Disability, for. GI condition that has plagued me for over 50 years and I have been waiting for a determination. I was not aware that a reevaluation was even possible until recently, and it would be an enormous benefit to me, both mentally and financially as I am no longer able to work. Thank you for your time.\nHenry Thompson\nLets talk about what a scam the PACT Act is, I was denied despite having evidence and I know friends who are getting denied too.\nIraq 07 – waking up every morning to the smell of burning plastic and jet fuel.\nThey put you in charge because they know you have no courage or backbone – just another opportunist and yes man\nSecond attempt to post. I’m very suspicious of the video pronouncement. Anything coming from the current crop of “leaders” must be viewed with deep skepticism. There is clearly an attempt underway to further privatize VA Healthcare, and that is no surprise. The current administration is run by anti-human tyrants driven by one value: maximize wealth and concentrate power.\nI’ve only had excellent experiences with VA Health Care and the people are always extremely supportive and knowledgeable. When I ask VA Healthcare reps why VA healthcare is so much better than the (un)healthcare in the private sector, the answer is almost always the same: “At the VA, we care about people; in the private sector they care about making money.” Well, that obsession with making money, at the expense of the health of veterans is what they will try to bring more and more into VA Healthcare. Vets will be treated increasingly as disposable. Moves toward privatization started under Trump 1, and now under Trump 2, and the DOGE steamroller, they will roll over VA Health care. Vets better stand up soon to protect it, or it will be gone….\nThere is nothing efficient about this administration. Tired of hearing such MAGA nonsense. Give us a break, there is a rapist and wife abuser as the SECDEF who has nowhere near enough experience to run our military-he’s a Fox news host! That is beyond reprehensible-and that is who is leading our brothers and sisters still in service? What a slap in the face. That being said, I have no faith in any of you to take care of our veterans who are no longer serving, especially from a draft dodger Commander in Chief who was too cowardly to serve his country. Like everything the DOGE claims that is false and with zero proof, I doubt VA claims are being processed any quicker. You just fired 1,000 VA employees, most of them are veterans. Drop the lies….tired of an incompetent administration who cares nothing about the average American or Veteran.\namen brother!\nOh look, another status quo shill for our benevolent dictator.\nMr. Collins, I am a 74 year old Vietnam Marine Corps vet. I am 90 plus % with unemployability to 100% PT. I have a family of 5. They are all from the Philippines and are all legal with blue passports. I have a lot of friends who would love you to look at the matrix and our pay. My son from my first marriage is also as I am. 2003 to 2007 Marine and 100% by unemployability. He is 44 this year and cannot work.\nFor myself, I am under, I believe, poverty level. He is just above it. We will not be getting a raise with our President! Our raises aren’t even figured by what inflation truly is to US. Maybe you can figure out a way to at least increase the base pay for us.\nFor my son… He is moving to Thailand because social security says he can work!!!!! The government says he can’t. Maybe someone can fix the wording for Social Security or someone besides a DEI can look at his claim.\nSemper Fi\nSecretary Collins, thanks for posting this video. I hope Veterans will come to this site for VA news rather than be alarmed by the Lamestream Media. And thanks for serving our country, and Veterans well.\nDOGE, is not doing anything but wasting tax payers money. Stop falling for these lies. VA Secretary is not fighting for us he is going alone with them. They just laid off 1000 VA employees when the VA need more staff. This is BS.\nMany thanks for the quick clarification on our benefits. Hate to see guys and gals getting upset because of what has been said or inferred. We all know Trump’s way of thinking and he would not touch the benefits unless they were being taken advantaged or stolen.\nThis did not instill the trust and confidence I was hoping for from you, Mr. Secretary. You simply sounded like a Trump talking head pointing fingers and defending non-government employees. You have made it clear that if at any point the current administration says to drop veterans benefits you will bow the knee and roll over to their every whim. Very disappointing. You are absolutely not committed to us, the veterans. Grow a pair and stand for the veterans you serve, and not some childish billionaires.\nMy experience is first-hand and arises from my following up on the very unusual non-receipt of a reply to a message which I recently sent to one of my VA providers via the myhealth.va.gov messaging platform. I phoned and reached the doc’s RN, who apologized and explained that the doctor, who is additionally burdened as the department chair, was under intense stress and an unexpected extra workload because the arranged hiring of another physician for the department had been frozen. That turned the intended staffing plan, which had been inclusive of the new hire physician, on its ear and required major on-the-fly personnel assignment adjustments. Then a large group of nurses who had been working from home via their computers, since their jobs were done by phone and emailing with patients, were ordered to return to the hospital for no apparent reason, where there is no space for them! These kinds of created problems have no corollary benefits and are the opposite of improving patient care!\nWell done information, I was a recent inpatient for 8 days at the MKE VA, I found it interesting that 2 CNA staff talked while I was watching Fox news that the VA was going to have cuts ? Actually I knew better being a Retired Army member and not a Democrat voter !\nI didn’t watch the video, you lost me with your cowardly support of DOGE and its illegal activities. I don’t believe you for a second. Who doubts that your fearless leaders, cowards, liars and thieves all do not intend to cripple the VA and “drown it in a bathtub” with the rest of the Federal Government? I am offended that you think we are so blind and stupid as to believe these criminals are not going to hack away at the VA. Astonishing.\nAppreciate the information\nr/Al\nUSA/MSG(ret)\nlo que sea, donde sea, cuando sea\nWhat will people think once they find out how untruthful the current administration is with respect to what they’re actually doing; which is to undermine confidence in all government functions so the argument can then be made that privatization is the remedy to all of the made up problems that we’re currently hearing about. If that were to happen, how long do any of you reading this think it will take for those privatized and previously government functions to be raided, pillaged, and desecrated leaving all of us with nothing to show for our years of service and commitment? Better wake up.\nYeah, sure Jan. Benefits back to the veterans. Not likely, back to the wealthiest 1% and corporations. Shame on Musk and his adolescent henchmen as well as 47 for the illegal dismissal of the dedicated employees of the VA who were also likely veterans. I stand with you.\nPresident Trump made a great pick for Secretary for the VA in Doug Collins! I am very confident that Secretary Collins will fight for every Veteran in this great country of ours and Make The VA Great Again!!!!\nWhat I’m getting from between the lines is we’re gonna hear a lot more “that’s not service related” and more claim denials. Words are trash, we need to see results. We got enough lip service while serving. Show us actions and results or sit down and save the oxygen thieving.\nneither trump nor musk had the balls or the dedication to serve. if they mess with veterans that will start a very deadly civil war with men and women who are very good at combat. you do not want to f*** with these many millions of veterans most of whom believe in the 1st and 2nd amendments as highly important in protecting freedom. we the people will take our country back from felon trump–the worst embarrassment in our nation’s entire history.\nDoug, knock off the political bullsh-t; you are not a member of Congress anymore. I don’t expect to hear a partisan line of attack against the media. I will hold you accountable for ensuring there are no drastic cuts to the VA, aside from actual fraud and abuse. Not the cascade of misinformation coming from Doge. Do your f**g job and manage the VA to improve the range and quality of veteran services. I get sick to my stomach reading about the plights of some verterans in these comment.\nDoug Collins is a very honorable man. I feel very confident in his ability, integrity and work ethic. We all know you are dedicated and will give your best effort.\nMr. Collins,\nI have been fighting the VA disability benefits for 14 years. They do not recognize the Leukemia that I have and say it does not meet the qualifications that someone has set for Agent Orange. I have appealed the decision made by clerks not a doctor of oncology. I am on the Agent Orange registry two times but can’t get the full 100% disability check.I had to retire early from the Dallas Police department because of the Leukemia. It would be nice to have a doctor of oncology look at my records to make a professional opinion. I also have submitted a case of record that went to court and the Veteran was awarded the pension. We both have the same kind of Leukemia and he was given the benefit of having a compelling case.\nI’m a disabled veteran as the government knew the water that we were drinking,bathing and food that was contaminated with chemicals that the government knew. That water killed many and made veterans and families sick.. I for one spent 2 years at Camp Lejeune and have HEART issues and CANCER..I rely on my Veterans disability and medical insurance..I hope and pray the new administration that I voted in does not do anything stupid to our very loyal and dedicated veterans.. This seems like this administration cares about no one but themselves!!!\nPresident puts a freeze on federal hiring which includes the VA. – Then president removes the freeze on VA medical hires. +\nThen Musk fires all probationary hires-\nExplain to me Mr Secretary, how is firing all the new hires you just gave the green light to, plus all the probationary ( hires with less than a year already on the job) is improving veteran’s healthcare\nMy claim was received 2years and 6 months ago with no word or activity on my claim..I can’t believe that there are only 4 judges for over 400,000 claims..\nI Am over 75 years old..\nThe truth will surface about a year from now one way or the other. I live in Idaho and have to say the VA is much more responsive and efficient than the private sector health care. Please don’t mess with that.\nI find it hard to believe after over 50 years of the Vietnam War ended the Veterans are not being compensated financially for their services I attended a combat veterans counseling session I am Desert Storm/Shield combat veterans there were Vietnam Veterans attending also the reasons that I heard for these Veterans not being compusated properly is appalling you have to prove the chemical Agent Orange was sprayed in the area you served in that is unbelievable the military assigned you to fight in Vietnam and now over 50 years later I have to proved where I was in the jungle of a foreign country we need some Vietnam Veterans combat veterans working in the department for compensation to help assist in taking care of all Veterans all the opiates and the other mind altering drugs they are prescribing is not enough to help care for disabled veterans mental or physical disabilities we need help taking care of our own people here at home the good ole USA.\n2 of my va dr called me a lair. Saif I was faking my disability to gain money and benefits\nHelp me please. I have no one to help.me.\nPlus after 3 wifes 2 passed away Please help me President Trump our Commander in Chief\nThe minute king Donald say cut the VA cost and befits this guy will drop to his knees and say yes sir.\nCongratulations Mr. Secretary!\nThank you for your service.\nMay God watch over you in your new role with the VA.\nStrength and Honor!\nThank you sincerely,\nSRA Alan R. Boisvert\nWhy do we not get paid travel expense for driving to medical appointments? I had dozens of appointments over the past 3 years and have not got paid.\nPlease do not be intimidated by the draft-dodging Trump and his agenda that consists of revenge and retaliation. He is single-handedly jeopardizing our country’s democracy more than anyone else in our history. Dissing John McCain was the lowest of the low.\nSenators and Congressmen of the Republican Party are being forced to bow to his wishes simply because he has threatened them by having them be primaried. The VA has been very good to me and countless other vets, please continue to stand by us.\nPeter Haviland Army 11Bravo. C.I.B. MoPH\nHelp\nI am a Marine Corps veteran disabled discharged. Now 100% 7 years now.\nYet I need HELP. Please, until this gets to our President Trump.\n250 years OUR CORPS has protected the Commander in Chief.\nNow this (JOSHUA REMMERT) Marine needs the support of President Trump\nShare pls\nI have evidence that Strong Hold Health Care LLC has violations. I have recorded and actual conversation bribery. I have recorded of stealing veteran disability time and cash from these veterans\nI was almost killed in Beruit Lebanon peace keeping 200 plus Marines die and you deny my claims\nI filed for dependent benefit for my wife on August 24 , 2024 to date I have not received the benefit . I have checked with the appropriate office and have been advised that nothing was wrong with the app and that it was going through the system\nand the benefit would be paid retroactive to the application date. No one seems to know how long this process will take. How can I learn when this benefit will begin?\nI feel this is untrue in a sense. I have been waiting almost 3 years and my remanded claim is still sitting in the same place it was assigned to in December so I’d imagine another year.\nTypical Trump/Fascist propaganda\nI am concerned about co-pay on my percriptions I am disabled (10%) and on fixed income\nThanks for the reassurance.\nThe VA is one of our nations most caring and compassionate organizations and your leadership sounds like it will stay that way.\nGod bless you\nGod bless our president\nGod bless our nation\nNot true, you fear monger. President Trump said he is looking to expand veterans benefits. However, the fat needs trimmed almost everywhere, and if you’re going to spew lies, you might need to worry.\nI am a VA driver from Butler county.\nI take veterans to amd from VA hospitals.\nI was told because of the VA hiring freeze we could not add any more drivers. We are really short on drivers, being as of right now their are only three of us. Is this so?\nLet’s get our Vets off the streets & into some housing that’s been occupied by the Biden Admin illegal aliens, get them fed properly and training and job opportunities that were wasted on these illegals.\nAnswer me this, WHY IS THE VA SLASHING OVER $800 FROM MY TDIU PAYMENT PER MONTH?\nThe VA loves to see Veterans Homeless EH?\nI’m going to save this video so I can make a stitch of you responding to project 2025 and president Trump removing all of the benefits you’re lying about not being cut. I bet destroying the lives of 1000 probationary employees was right up there with “improving veteran care.” Less care givers = more care giving. Got it. Make it make sense.\nFirst let me apologize for many of the comments I have read below by misguided Vets. Next, thank you for answering the call to cooperate with the President and DOGE. I think our President had done a magnificent job correcting the horrid damage done by the prior administration.\nSteve Hall, SGT, 9th Inf. Division\nVietnam Vet 1968-69\nhow come VA employees were terminated by DOGE without a proper evaluation or notice.? DOGE terminated them without any idea how it would affect VA services. We vets are not stupid so quit feeding us incorrect information\ni like and trust i watch him for year he seem far and a GOD loveing man he will bb good for vet\nMr. Secretary,\nAs an Army veteran in NC, there is a big problem with community care program. You cannot get a phone call into the office. I have had to use my Congressman twice to get any help. I am looking forward to you getting the VA back to the Trump 1st term standards like Wilkie.\nHire more people so that our claims can get processed a little faster\nNo no DOGE is illegal dont trust them. It’s beyond unconstitutional we can do better\nATTN: US Troops in Kosovo on KFOR missions since 1999, much under OEF funding. The entire place burns everything 24/7 (there is no modern trash/sanitation system) and US troops serve on NATO FOBs downwind from KEK (Soviet Era dirty coal-fired Power Plant) – it looks and smells like Blade Runner 2049. I have the pics, DD-214 and lung nodules to prove it. YET, Kosovo is NOT on the PACT Act for Environmental Exposure List. Whisky Tango Foxtrot – VA? PS- I’m also one of the rare Vets who earned BOTH the MGIB and Ch33 Post 9/11. I got the letter saying “Congrats….you earned both, please wait for our next letter in ~ 22 month”. I’d like to re-start Edu ASAP …..please.\nThis video is nonsense! VA cannot possibly care for Veterans faster ,when you have allowed DOGE to cut the workforce so drastically, and so willy-nilly, with ZERO thought to the impact of those thoughtless cuts. Long term, expertly trained employees, many of them Veterans themselves, have been fired for alleged poor performance. RUBBISH!\nDoge never took the time to look at performance. They never took the time to look at responsibilities. They never took the time to look at the fact that VA employees are truly dedicated to Veterans, who have unique issues and concerns that require skilled and knowledgeable employees to address efficiently.\nDOGE representatives at VA cannot possibly be reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans, because DOGE is not qualified to do so. The folks who ARE qualified to do that for Veterans have been terminated, lied to, denigrated, and insulted. Doge is grabbing as much data as they can get their hands on, and nobody really knows what data they are grabbing, or what they will do with it now. And, that includes you!\nYour comment that you look forward to partnering with DOGE would indicate that you have been asked to do so. You haven’t!\nServices are not going to be better or faster with less employees present to doing what they know how to do best, while an unelected, un-vetted DOGE is determined to cut as much as they can, from wherever they can. DOGE makes these cuts, not to help taxpayers, but to funnel money into Elon Musk’s companies, assuring that taxpayer’s needs are not being addressed at all,. Nor are the needs of Veterans.\nIt comes down to this…you took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. You also swore to support and defend our Nation’s Veterans. You can now either live up to your oaths, or fail entirely! Pick a spot!\nIf choosing the latter, you would not be alone. The vast majority of elected or appointed Republicans will be hanging their photos on the wall of shame, right next to yours, as Doge continues to be permitted to continue this chaos with no oversight, as our Veterans are abandoned, and Democracy is altered entirely.\nWhat you likely should not continue to do is to address us all with assurances that everything is A-Okay. You are honestly not in a position to provide those assurances. Nobody is.\nIn what state at they clearing cases, I have a case in DC, and file supplemental appeal that they broke into three case. There is no justice, nor when they claim an error in the case but the case remains or no change in decision dispite call center giving said information that there was an error. But I’m also sure no one cares or will fallow for more information.\nI’ve read that there will be a “means test” in 2026 using 2025 tax info. Any clarification on this would be great.\nI agree with Mike from 18 February 2025.\nLMAO like anyone is going to listen much less respond.\nThis is a propaganda piece/video. Anything coming from this Administration must be viewed with great suspicion. There is a goal of increasingly privatizing VA Health Care (already underway and pushed under the previous Trump Admin). I’ve had, up to now, only very positive experiences with the VA Healthcare and when I ask people at the VA healthcare facility why VA Healthcare is so much better than in the private sector the standard answer is: “We are here to help people; in private health care they are out to make money.” Those moneymakers are looking to loot VA Healthcare too. We must stand up and stop the privatization of VA Healthcare. The people in charge have anti-human values. They only value increases in their wealth and their power, and we veterans will suffer.\nHello Doug, my name is Sanders Cupac and I am a 72 year old Vietnam era veteran living in Thailand. I live off of my 994$ monthly social security payment and it was stopped in February for no reason. PLEASE help me. I LOVE TRUMP and the new transparency and stopping WASTE.\nPLEASE HELP ME, I am really hurting here.\nSecretary Collins, Make sure you direct them to PR. As a USVI resident and an old contractor for the Army, I see where efficiency can be easily had by using more LOCAL USVI Community Care providers (we have three Islands) and DME services. The Acting Director has stated he is addressing the discrimination he see between the PR VA and USVI Veterans and vendors. ex. The PR VA will fly a contractor to USVI to install a wheelchair tire or deliver a bedside hospital table.\nOr, they will fly the Veterans to PR to have a tooth cleaning instead of using the local Dentist that has been registered w/ OPTUM and every other similar contractor we’ve had in the past. I literally, had to fight tooth and nail to get VA community care employee to use a local dentist, pt or mental health provider for the Veteran I’m a Caregiver for instead of flying her back and forth to PR.\nYes, in the USVI we are lacking in Medical options, but the options we have are top notch, and maybe the VA should look at & take into consideration our high cost of living and give USVI community care providers an additional percentage over medicare allowance (out of the cost saving from airfare) to entice more local community care providers.\nOh hell since I’m asking for the moon, just build the USVI our own small VA hospital similar to the one we had in Alaska in the early 2000’s (just put it on St. Croix). Let me know when you’re going to do a site visit.\ndon peters II\nUSVI Veteran\n“Always out Front”\nI am an AF Vet. I utilize va community health care because I live far from any va health facility. Collins talks a good game. He’s allowing that idiot in the white house – I should BOTH idiots – Trump and Musk to get rid of va personnel that are needed to make sure va services are carried out correctly. I have to reapply yearly for my community care and EVERY year I have to jump through hoops to get it done. God help you if you don’t – I would have to pay the bills. This year is no exception. My end date is Feb 25 – I applied again in January and I still do not have confirmation on my renewal. This is just one example. These are not medical personnel but people that manage the ‘behind the healthcare’ paperwork and various other things that make the va work. BUT TRUMP HAS FIRED VETS – EVEN DISABLED VETS – FROM THE VA. You tell me how THAT helps veterans. What a load of horse hockey. You think the voters are buying this? Think again. D. Taylor\nMr Secretary: I forgot to mention the most important points.\nAs you know there is talk among members of Congress (your party) to change the requirements for\nservice-connected disability especially when it comes to PTSD. What is your personal position on\nthese proposed changes and your position as Secretary of the Veteran’s Administration?? Do you agree\nwith the congressmen’s comments that too many veterans are filing false claims and receiving benefits??\nMy position is that when ‘too many people’ are getting a benefit from the government in a particular program\nyou raise the requirements. Got an opinion??\nI am so happy Trump won. I am overjoyed that every DEI programs was cut. I hope DOGE takes a wrecking ball to every wasteful program that is ripping off the tax payer.\nThank you for the reassuring platitudes. Now, am I supposed to believe them? I suppose we’ll have to see but VAs history looks bleak. We, the veterans, have no real say and certainly no control over the services we are provided nor the quality of those services. As a medical professional, I can report they range from excellent – thanks to a dedicated, professional staff – to non-existent – thanks to a lack of funds that would make Mr. Musk proud.\nI have to say, in all honesty, that I do not trust you sir. I hope I’m mistaken. But, as the saying goes, “Money talks, BS walks.”\nAs an aside: The folks suffering the effects of the poisonous environment at Camp Lejeune will, I’m sure, receive the same timely assistance that those receiving assistance for Agent Orange poisoning: After they’re dead.\nWe’ve all been used and discarded.\nDear Secretary Collins, here in Rhode Island, we have concerns of cutbacks. Alost of rumors, to include a 91 year old Korean War Disabled Veteran being told he no longer will be assigned a primary provider, which has been responsible to prescribe his medications. As a veteran contributor for RINEWSTODAY.com I sent an email to Director Lawrence Connell, Providence VA Medical to address Rhode Island veterans concerns who have contacted me on benefit cuts due to termination of employees. More than 48 hours, and a response which only included attaching a VA press release, no response to how many employees terminated at providence VA Medical Center.\nIn addition, I also sent an inquiries to Senator Jack Reed (d) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (d), only to receive a response without answering the simple questions sent to Director Connell.\nIm asking for answers to the following:\nHow many VA Providence Medical Center employee were terminated and their positions( I review your list of exemptions, I see NO medical or benefits that would be impacted.\nHere is the mail sent to Connell, Reed, and Whitehouse ( only to be stonewalled on answers:\nGood Day Director,\nI hope all is well.\nFew question, about an article I am working on for publishing on Thursday for RINEWSTODAY\nQ1 Did any employees working at or for VA Providence Medical receive termination letters as part of recent 17,000 employees terminated?\nQ2 If yes, were you able to receive waivers for those employees; as you may be aware, VA Secretary Doug Collins statements waivers are allowed, and not one of the firings impact Veteran medical or benefits, https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nQ3 Last week, according to a wife of a veteran at a private long tern care facility ( which the veteran is paying for), says last week she was told her 92 year husband primary care provider is no longer employed. She request a new one, to include an appointment. She was DENIED, VA advised he no longer was eligible for primary provider since the facility he is in has one. He still will be eligible to receive audio, prescriptions, etc…But will not be assigned a primary.\nWhat is the policy for a combat disable veteran living in a RI long term care facility—-are they still eligible for a VA provider, since they remain registered in VA Health care?\nHoping to have information no later than 5:00PM on Wednesday, for an article to be published as a feature in my weekly veteran column on RINEWSTODAY, which is published every Thursday.\nJohn A Cianci\nRINEWSTODAY\nVeteran contributor\nHow stupid do you think we are? 1,000 crisis hotline workers just got let go. This is all BS lip service. You’re a straight up liar.\nI am a Gulf War veteran and lost my hearing and I am considered clinically deaf but the VA pension program has determined that I am only 10 percent disabled. I receive a paltry $351 a month pension. I fear that The orange man and his sidekick, who have no problem lying to the public, would gladly take that from me at a moments notice. Anybody who associates themselves with those two men are liars by default. You can’t support someone who tells lies more than the truth, and not become complicit in those lies.\nIt is sad when “clergy” lie! Stop being partisan! Our media is doing what they are supposed to do. Report on the news. The REPUBLICAN controlled congress is saying that VA Benefits are on the chopping block! When you have to come back and “eat crow” by telling us that you were “wrong,” but probably not in another video, because you will not have the courage to do so, WHAT THEN?!? Trump said that he would not mess with medicare… oh wait, medicare cuts are being “doged” out too. Oh wait, wasn’t it said by some Republican Senators that no VA worker would lose their job? Yeah, tell that to the 1000 workers who were fired last week. Our social security is “safe” too, right?!!! Just stop lying! We veterans deserve more than “clergy” lying!!! All Veterans deserve a non-partisan VA Secretary looking out for all of our needs!!! #STOPTHELIES\nAnother liar from the Party of Trump. VA Health is already understaffed, and now, many staffers have been fired to satisfy Trump and Musk’s lust for chaos, injustice, cruelty, and to cut spending so that they can lower the corporate tax rate to 15% for themselves and other billionaires. Does that seem compatible with the lies Collins just spouted? Refer back to this video after they drop veterans in lower priority groups from VA healthcare, in line with Project 2025, you know, the plan that Trump denied any knowledge of. Russ Voight, who is helping to oversee the destruction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was the major architect of Project 2025 at the Heritage Foundation.\nThanks… And I’d like you to know that my local VA center here provides excellent care. I’m aware of Vought’s and Project 2025’s recommendations and I’m thankful for veteran’s organizations supporting the continuation of the services and benefits we currently have. I am still concerned at any attempts to split or divide veterans into new claimants versus old claimants or veterans receiving social security versus those not receiving social security. We all took oaths to serve our country knowing that we had no control over when or where we might be in harms way. We all deserve the same levels of care.\nPretty good video\nWe don’t believe you DOUG!\nI just went to the VA yesterday in Des Moines. They need staffing help and equipment. Please establish a hotline for us to call or chat with to keep things improving at our clinics. I have been miss diagnosed twice because of these things.\nIt would have been nice to be able to watch the video. Youtube won’t let me today unless I sign in so they can track me. I refuse to let them. So, anything you post using youtube will not reach people like me for a while at least. Youtube decides I need to sign in during time frames of their choosing for random lengths of time.\nSenator Collins, we have a huge problem with the VA in the Myrtle Beach area, myself and another veteran would love to sit down and discuss the issues with you\nsay what you want to say. ‘giving and improving services’ in your world means privatization.\nYour job is to continue this privatization program. Look at your background and your prior\nwork experience.\nThere are presently 40k unfilled positions at VA facilities. This is the hammer to use to\nsend to private doctors. Private doctors who have limited or no experience with veterans\nor veteran’s issues.\nDon’t play vets as fools, don’t bs us, tell us what you are really going to do.\nIt is disgraceful that they align yourself with DOGE and Project 2025 (which this administration is definitely following). DOGE has gained illegitimate access to everyone’s personal, professional, and financial data and we’re just supposed to accept that Elon Musk is going to police himself on conflicts of interest. Yeah right. What I would give to be a security personnel armed to the teeth at one of these locations. Musk and his fratboys would never make it to a single computer without going through an insanely extensive background check. I have veteran friends who have been waiting 2+ years on a background check and Musk just gets a green flag immediately? I call bull!.\nAs for the VA. I don’t have an issue with the healthcare I receive. Last year they extracted a tumor, and the wait time was almost nonexistent. Just had to do a number of tests beforehand that took some time. I tell my friends and family about the good care I receive, at what would essentially be socialized healthcare. Super scary, isn’t it? That healthcare would be funded by taxpayer dollars. That’s why republicans for many many years have tried to privatize the VA, which would turn it into a for-profit organization. You should be blocking every attempt to interfere with the VA unless it has to do with expanding resources or increasing funding. My local VA hospital is severely understaffed, and I live in a larger city. I can’t imagine how it must be to live in the countryside.\nMake no mistake, republicans are eager to defund the VA and turn it into profit for big pharma. Nothing scares them more than a citizen that has power over their own lives, and they want to take that power for themselves. Resist with all your might if you want the support of veterans!!\nDon’t look like a lot of NAM VETS here. Must be that we’re mostly gone and ones left are giving up.\nThat’s good to know I hope it’s true. Who is a supervisor to reach for Voc rehab. My husband school was not paid so now he’s not in school. Know one is answering emails. A phone number would be nice for Maryland\nlet us keep using ds login to access va.gov no need to make another login for va way to much work and 1 more thing to worry about as i go through during my cancer treatment\nPlease explain how loss of a thousand staffers will improve VA operations. Thanks.\nSir,you should do an investigation at the Austin VA clinic in texas.ive been going there for 32 years and it has gone to sh-t.they have mostly foreign doctors that are there for a check and don’t give a damn about your health.if I had the money I would go to a civilian doctor. thanks for your time.\nAny veteran who has ever had to deal with your entire inadequate and antiquated system for health, benefits, etc. will tell you just how BROKEN the VA has been for a very long time.\nNo intelligent veteran is going to believe the lip service you’re giving out. We’ve been buried in so much bureaucracy and red tape for so long that unless you actually back up your claims of positive change with some real action and results, you are just another politician who cares nothing about the brave men and women who have served this country.\nWe are human beings first and foremost, so start treating us as such. Look at the systems that you have in place and figure out how to run more efficiently. Ask yourself if the months and years it takes to process benefits, administrative changes, health requests, etc. would be acceptable to one of your loved ones. Would this be acceptable to you if you had no other options for healthcare? Would you take your wife or children to a VA facility? I won’t even take myself to VA healthcare, so I already know what your answer is.\nThe VA is like a sad, sad joke to veterans. It a shame that anyone who has served their country should be treated the way they are. You should be ashamed of what you’ve walked into and if you don’t do anything to clean up the mess, none of us will have any respect for you. We know when we’re being BS’d.\nAll you idiots in the comments want to blame this on Trump or Elon. You know damn well that the VA has been broken much much longer than that. So, Secretary Collins—in the event that you ever look at these comments, how about you earn your paycheck and show us Veterans some real results. Faster claims, faster appointments, update your systems… HELL, overhaul the whole damn system because it’s BROKEN. You wouldn’t run a normal business like this because it would have gone under a long time ago. FIX THIS BROKEN SYSTEM.\nSomeone mentioned contacting our congressmen. I highly suggest that we all do. It’s time for real change.\nRatings examiners are leaning on Contract C & P Examiners to give negative exams that will disqualify Veterans from establishing nexus for their conditions. C & P Examiners are conforming to the VBA’s desire to deny claims, which is trying to find fault and deny veterans’ claims. The Pact Act is not benefiting Vietnam Veterans.\nMy wife was in Balad Iraq and exposed to burn pits. She was denied on her initial claim so she asked for a higher review. The higher review said the VA made a mistake but it’s been over a year with no progress. It is not true that the VA is clearing claims quicker. She is incapacitated 15 days a month from migraine headaches a presumptive condition from burn pits. She was labeled as having tension headaches in the initial claim.\nThe voters elected draft dodging felon to be POTUS. The day after the election I asked my coworkers, “Do we have a new Commander in Chief or a new Dictator in Chief?” Not 1 person answered but the look in their eyes… PRICELESS! I cannot believe anything anyone says that works for this dude. Mr. Collins, please prove me wrong BUT, I have already had 2 appointments with my VA PMC cancelled. The first was scheduled for Feb 2025 and the follow in March 2025. I have not heard when they will be rescheduled. Do U have that problem?\nThank you for your comments and for clearing up the “RUMORS”! HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AS OUR SECRETARY, thank you for serving.\nYou sir are a liar.\nIf there is anyone in government that I feel I can trust implicitly it’s Doug Collins… I believe he will put all of his efforts into improving services and working to ensure that Veterans get everything they have earned…As a 100% disabled Marine Vietnam Vet I am at the age where a lot of things need attention and being in the Central FL area I have had the best care anyone could want and I’m confident that the future will only get better…\nI believe President Trump and Sec Doug Collin’s. President Trump has always been put veterans first unlike Biden and Obama. And Sec Collin’s was\na straight shooter as a congressman. He is a good man.\nThank you for the awesome message!!!\nAll talk…How can he say they are clearing cases faster than ever in just a week. Another Trump Simpleton.\nThank you for the awesome message!!!!\nAnd thank you for all the VA does!!!\nYour mouth is moving so you’re obviously lying. No one in the administration should be trusted al all. In fact, expect the opposite from what’s said.\nHere are things that need to change at the VA. I have been going to the N.Texas VA in Dallas for over 25 years. The doctors there have almost killed me 3 times, and it is all in my medical records. 1. Stop hiring unqualified foreign doctors. The Dallas VA is full of them. 2. Make it easy for Vets to get outside medical help, when we can’t get it at the VA. The way it works now, and the way it is set up, is a total nightmare. I have diabetes and I’m on blood thinners. The orthopedic doctors will not see me half the time. I need a shot in my knee every 6 months so my knee will not grind bone on bone. They have refused to see me the last three times I have ask. This has got to stop. These doctors are there to help us, not turn us down. 3. The service we get at the Dallas VA is shocking. I just told you about one problem. There is many more. The Dallas VA is good at covering their tracks on problems like these.. We need a lot of changes at the VA in Dallas.\nI don’t have a comment, but I do have a question. Will Veterans have to choose which monthly check they want to keep receiving and their other compensation we receive be cut out completely?\nIf that is true, then you as sos and others are NOT doing what is best for Veterans. Firing employees at the Veterans Crisis Line is just plain evil, too. If you are not a Veteran then y’all don’t know and definitely don’t care what is important and needed for Veterans.\nThere cuttin . Just denied your claim\n“Doing what DOGE is supposed to be doing.” What exactly is that? Nobody in the Administration has publicly laid out who they are (personnel), what they are doing, who is in charge, and whether they are actually employees of the U.S. government.\nYou say that the VA is doing things quicker and better now than it was doing only 3 weeks ago. Pretty hard to believe that.\nFinally you close with an offer to “come to see me.” And just how is that supposed to work?\nWhat has been addressed by my Representatives in Congress is that VA Joint Compensation needs to be “looked at as a way to cut back on unnecessary spending.” This is not media fluff but from my Congressman.\n“Doug” are you going to fight for VA Joint Compensation or immediately do what you are told by the higher ups?\nYes you can contact me with follow-up comments.\nDear Mr. Secretary,\nI am a 100% Disabled, United States Marine Corps, Desert Storm Veteran.\nYou speak so lovingly about DOGE, but who are DOGE, and what authority do they have to look at government (including VA) contracts?\nDOGE is not an official Department of the US government, as creation of Departments in the Federal Government can only be created by Congress, by law, according to the Constitution.\nDOGE is not a government contracted corporation, so how is it that they have Legal approval to enter government facilities, look at government contracts, look at private American Citizens information, stop actual government contracts and fire government employees? How is it that they can do all of this and more without Security Clearance or any other type of government background checks, or government contracts bidding?\nWhat gives you the right to forego the security requirements put in place to protect Veterans, and to just allow them to run through Veteran Administration data?\nYou say that DOGE is looking through VA contracts to find inefficiencies and that the VA is not getting it’s budget cut. First, isn’t that your job? Second, if that is true, then why are VA employees being fired?\nI request timely and truthful answers to these questions.\nI intend to gather fellow Veterans and sue you, DOGE, and the government and other heads of Departments of the Federal government, to get everything that DOGE is breaking, fixed, and to hold department heads accountable for allowing this to happen. I also intend to sue to have DOGE and it’s members, and it’s supposed leader, Elon Musk, brought up on criminal charges for likely violating a variety of laws involving:\n1) entering secured government facilities without the requisite approvals and security checks.\n2) illegally withholding funds provided by Congress.\n3) illegally accessing the private information of American Citizens, including those of Veterans.\n4) many other violations.\nThe American People, especially Veterans and Seniors, are Angry Mr. Secretary.\nInspite of your empty words, I know personally that cuts have already begun, and in all likelihood will continue to expand. Numerous employees and new hires at the Dept of VA have been removed or furloughed, including many veterans, as the government is one of the higgest employeers of vets.\nSupporting this regime causing needless unfounded destruction to our country based on lies and unsubstantiated claims needa to stop before we truly dont have a country anymore.\nAs a 100 percent service connected veteran. I’m concerned with the difficulties of seeing Dr’s in a timely manner. In Tennessee all i get are excuses. I can’t seem to get my medicine as I did in Alaska. I wish someone would contact myself so I can get honest positive results. I want to live. I did my part.\nSimple question: will he stand up and fight Trump and Musk if they try to cut Veterans benefits or be just another sycophant?\nHahahaha!!! No. No one believes you and it’s not as funny as my haha’s might suggest.\nYou’re a liar! Loyal only to your dear leader the president elon, I mean donny t.\nYou are and will continue to sell us out along with the rest of the United States.\nJust tell us the truth. I mean, why stop lying now? You have absolutely nothing to lose at this point.\nI’m sure you know and understand that our level of trust and confidence in our federal government is at an all-time low. I can only hope that your words in this message are true and that myself and other vets who have fought to preserve the Constitutional values of our country will not lose the benefits we have through the VA.\nWell one thing that needs improvement is benefits admin. They don’t seem to take the word of VA doctors regarding disabilities and instead contract out to outsiders who, no matter what VA doctors say, decide the disabilities don’t exist.\nThis would reduce outside contractors cost and better serve the veterans.\nMr. Collins, we are all for you and wish you a happy and productive tour.\nThis was a message from VA Secretary Collin’s to veterans addressing rumors about benefits cuts.\nHe succinctly stated there will be no cuts.\nYet some (obviously liberal) vets questioned his statement and went off on unrelated rants.\nIt embarrassing to witness such a lack of decorum from alleged vets who allegedly live this country.\nThank you DOGE for uncovering massive fraud—some likely at the VA—and thank you Secretary Collin’s for dispelling the rumors.\nHow about making the VA follow the law and allow us community care if we can’t get an appointment. Right now they are spitting in our face basically and not allowing it with like flat out NO if you request it. @!%^#@$#%\nYou’re cutting veterans out of the workforce? How does that help??????? Most vets are on a fixed income. I am glad II still have a job and extra insurance at age 64. This is a bunch of bull for our veterans!\nThis is all well and good. However, I will believe it when I see things change. I got out of the Air Force in November 1976 believing the VA was my Advocate. Being a Vietnam Era Veteran I know that is not the case. I am still fighting them. I fell and landed on my KNEES, they have called me a liar since the beginning because the doctor stated he was treating my right knee. I have had many surgeries since I got out. Almost all have been due to falls because of that Knee buckling. I have been honest and truthful the whole way. I cannot say that for the VA. I am at it again and see that I am at step 3 or 8. I figure that are going to delay until I am dead. They want us Vietnam ERA Vets to die and go away, and yet all we did was serve our Country while our Country spit in our faces. I will not be giving up until I am dead. Sadly The VA doesn’t really care. Mr Collins, let us see what you are doing, my Congressman never responded when I wrote him years ago.\nWe see what’s happening. Tread lightly.\nDoug, you sound like a used car salesman.\nI am a Veteran and a VA employee, and I am not buying what you seem to be trying to sell.\nWhen you start out your tenure by acting as if we at VA haven’t actually been working full speed ahead in order to serve Veterans, their survivors, and their caregivers, it shows that you do not understand how seriously we take our mission in performing the most noble job in the United States government.\nGet to know us. Get to know what we have been doing. Listen to us when we tell you what is or is not working, and what can work better. We know because we are the subject matter experts in what we do. We swore an oath because that is how much this job means to us. DOGE knows nothing about anything, and has loyalty to nobody, much less the American people.\nWe see you, Doug. I hope you’ll make the effort to see us, too.\nI have about 10+ remains in my file that’s been sitting there for years, I should be 100% but I’m not I’ve done everything in my power to get to 100% but for some reason or another and I don’t have an answer for this maybe you can answer my question why am I not not , at 100 percent::: Cancer survivor::: type two diabetes::: chronic kidney disease::: hypertension::: neuropathy::: exposure to ionizing radiation::: age range:::: And yet my file just sets there toxic water, Marine Corps base, Camp, Lejeune, kidney cancer::: kidney stones:::\nSorry I don’ t believe you sir and DOGE, Elon & Trump can all go to hell.\nMr. Secretary, Are you going to expand the act act to in clyde all exposures of toxic substances to include all of the the USA? Also anywhere in the European and Asia theater?\nMy claim was filed in 2020 and I am still waiting. All my evidence was submitted, I have already spoken with a judge and they are now just sitting on it and waiting. Years of waiting is not efficient and yet they are all still getting paid more than the average American to not help us vets. Do not even get me started on the horror show is supposed care at my local VA hospital. Those people would rather vets die than actually treat anyone.\nOn the campaign trail it was said that Project 25 was not in the plans for the government. And now we are seeing it coming into fruition.\nAnd the plans youre trying to ease our concerns about are in the CBO’s report.\nFrankly, I cannot trust that you will not push forward the agenda by the President’s Assistant to gut our government. You are lieing to us.\nUnfortunately this hold no weight. DOGE and President Trump have already fired hundreds in the VA including doctors and nurses. Appointments are getting canceled, services are not improving and can’t when you’re cutting staff. Trump said he wasn’t going to mess with Medicaid too, but now he’s all for gutting it as part of the latest bill put forth by the House. Project 2025 calls for privatization of services and reduction of disability and education benefits for veterans and that is the blueprint this administration is following.\nHow can I send you an email or contact you directly? My son who is an Army vet, is getting good service, but the VA Hospital in WPB, FL, 2 miles from the Presidents home in Mar a Lago is terrible. They treat staff like dirt and good doctors and staff leave. My son is suffering from PTSD and has been fighting the VA for 100% disability.\nYou don’t actually believe that load of horse manure do you? You can’t guarantee that VA services or benefits won’t be cut. Remember he hates the military and we are all suckers and losers. First time in my life that I’ve been embarrassed to be a disabled veteran.\nI am so happy that Doug Collins is the new VA Secretary. I am also so thankful that President Trump won the election. And most of all I am hoping that DOGE takes a wrecking ball to all the wasteful programs at the VA that take away from the mission to help Veterans. I think the DEI programs at VA were destructive and un American. I suspect that there are many more programs that are unnecessary. I also find it incredibly difficult to trust any therapist in a group setting or one on one that supports the delusion of a Veteran that thinks they are transgender. I think it is a crime to support the decision of a Veteran to “change” their gender. It was very hard for me to sit in a therapy session and be told to believe that a man is really a woman. How did that happen at the VA? I hope it ends.\nCan you address the gaining movement that President Trump is aware of to afford disabled veterans of a certain or higher disability percentage an exemption to federal income tax?\nI need immediate help with my va home loan. I’m being railroaded by the mortgage company even though I was under fema protection. I have called my senator and congressman in FL. I received letter stating they can only ask VA they can not influence even though we have been wronged. Please I tried to find your email address after you were confirmed but it just had your name no picture yet. Please help us. 22 years 3 wars 70 years old. Disabled veteran who filed for disability in 2019 and still waiting on it to get.off the administration desk. I’m totally deaf . My hearing loss was from working on aircraft and high frequency radiation same reason I could never have children but that’s only worth 10%.\nThank You Secretary Collins, Great to hear the truth as I truly believe with President Trump in Charge we will get that .Plus giving the VA What they need. Good luck GOD BLESS You and Yours ???Rev.Joe\nDear Sir, as a disabled combat veteran and a member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America I do not believe you or the current administration when you say write this drivel. The Trump administration has made it clear that the VA will be targeted for reductions, and having many appointments every month for my disabilities I have heard from people within the VA of what is going on, that good people are being let go, and that more is to come. We had a saying in Army Special Operations, “don’t piss down my back and tell me it’s raining”. We know better, deserve better, and don’t believe words, only actions. We’ll see, I’ll check back in next year and we can really see what is going to happen.\nWHEN CAN WE EXPECK A RASE IN OUR RETIRED PAYMENTS IT HAS BEEN SEVERL YEARS SINCE THEMILATERY HAS RECEIVE A PAY RASEL, EVERYTHING HAS GONE UP EXCEPT OUR PAY,\n. RESPECFULY\nRET. MSGT C, A.OLESKI L\nCONTACT E MAIL [redacted]\nDouglas Allen Collins is a lawyer, politician, and reserve chaplain. In the late 1980s, Collins served two years in the US Navy as a chaplain. After the September 11 attacks, Collins joined the USAF Reserve Command, where he presently serves as a chaplain (Colonel). As a member of the 94th Airlift Wing at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, he was deployed to Balad Air Base for five months in 2008 during the Iraq War. He is a member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the U.S. representative for Georgia’s 9th congressional district from 2013 to 2021 and in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2007 to 2013. He lost his bid for the senate. He finished third.\nHe is a “shoe clerk”, FOBBIT & RE-F.\nTrump & Musk didn’t serve. And I can’t believe any vet supported or supports them.\nHello Mr. Collins,\nWell, you said come see you if I have issues. So here I am. I have a few and no I’m not going to Ask VA on your website. I’ve been there and done that. It’s no help because it limits you to issues it’s willing to help with. Never the issues we Vets really want help with. I won’t get into them here, but if you’re serious about helping. I’d like to mail you a letter or send you an email detailing them.\nThank you,\nDan\nSounds like you’re trying to keep YOUR job! Are you willing to bet nothing is going to be cut at the VA? Please contact me on how much you are willing to wager.\nHe full of sh-t just like trump. He is lying to our face just like his boss trump. This guy is has no honor, respect and honesty every time him or his boss president elon / trump open their mouth is lies. He and his bosses trying to bring back BS choice program which is garbage. I used it before and it was nothing but garbage and I could have had everything I needed done by the in half the time it took with choice and they still never got it done right. No wonder the VA got rid of it before under president Biden. Trump ruins everything he touches like the VA. Leave the VA alone you can’t fix what is not broken and trump does not fix anything so stay of the VA system!!!!\nWhat is taking so long to get back pay. It was submitted Nov ‘23 and authorized Oct ‘24 and till today still waiting on the VA to audit my back pay.\nMr. “I been here for about a week,” this statement of assurance is hard to believe. Media spin is one of the most infectious hallmarks of our current Executive admisistration. It appears you’ve also caught the sick.\nI hear no cuts then I hear find things to get rid of! That means cuts of some kind, $, programs, Doctors, privileges. There has already been cuts! Can’t trust my own Gov SMH. I served to honor my country with excellent work that keeps America free. In a month this duely paid for Government has separated the U.S. not uniting the U.S.\nGreat, I thank you for shar5ing this video\nKeep up the good work!\nWhat about the fact that ALL hiring is suspended for the next four months? What about critical VA positions that need to be filled to support Veterans in getting their benefits? What about the fact that all new hires who were on probationary status – yes, even those new hires in the VA – have been fired? What about the critical positions that they filled? The equation is clear – cutting positions equals fewer services. It’s been a slash and burn with no strategic thinking or management since January 21, 2025.\nI’m glad to see that the VA will still be able to meet our needs. Hearing aids are critical for a lot of us, we can hear our children talking, laughing and our spouses no longer have to raise their voice. It may seem trivial to others but it means the world to us to hear clearly.\nWords are cheap — let’s see what actions are taken. How secure is our personal and medical information once it’s shared with the kids from DOGE (probably none of whom ever served the people of the US or are veterans) whose loyalty seem to be to one man, who never served, and not to veterans or our country!\nYou’re a liar! Right now the cuts that have been proposed are going to take away the call centers for VA prescriptions. You’re going to set us back 20 years. Stop lying it’s so easy to fact check you.\nI’m sure there’s nothing to worry about here. It’s not like trump just replaced the VA secretary with a talking head who claims that there’s nothing insidious about a billionaire and his team making tax cuts within the US government. Don’t worry guys, everything’s ok because trumps talking heads say so, nothing to worry about!\nGiven that the current director is a Trump appointee, I have little fairh that the benefits I was promised will not be cut further. I am sure I speak for a large percentage of veterans when I say that I will believe it when I see it. Pres Musk and his sidekick, Trump have made their opinions on the military and veterans crystal clear; that they view us all as “suckers and losers”. Secretary, I want to believe you. However, the history speaks much louder than the “thoughts and prayers” speech.\nI have had 2 cases initial file 2017 – NOD Sept 2020 on docket Hearing July 2024 – still waiting to be sent to a Judge. Almost 8 yrs so far going through the system. Cannot find out how many cases are in front of me cannot see any indication how long it may take. All I hear is it will be awhile just be patient. Not sure about rest of veterans waiting to get their cases resolved but I am beyond “not” impressed .\nJust tired of the lip service.\nI would like to talk to someone about the\ncurrent problems in getting agent orange\nBenefits. It takes 2 years to get paperwork processed. To do this I had to hire an attorney who got 20 percent off top. Not all my paperwork was submitted at the same time I have been told I have to wait\nanother 2 years for the balance. I thought I paid all of this in 1968-69 in Vietnam.\nWhy don’t I believe you, Doug? What records are the DOGEies looking at? Are they looking at my service and medical records? Are they looking at my disability compensation?\nIf Trump/Musk plan DoD cuts why wouldn’t they cut veterans benefits? I just don’t trust them at all.\nI’m not worried about our benefits being cut or revamped. But I do have a problem, back in 2016 I was separated from Service because of Budget cuts. So when I was processing out, I received a check for my services of 26 yrs. I thought okay this is good since it stated that on my DD-214 that I was to receive it and nothing else was said or mentioned. Well when I went in to start the process of my disabilities from service, so when things were all graded and I was told what I would receive. Only after that I pay back the separation pay first. I was told that I never should have taken the separation pay. I was never told that in the beginning. So with that being said is that I should be able to receive that separation pay back.\nThank you sir ?? would it be possible to further assist with dental care for veterans that need dental help but can’t get it ? Living with dental pain is hard.\n100% agree with Earnest Lewis & I’m a white veteran\nAlso think my VA care has been excellent.\nSomething our draft dodger & President Musk could never understand\nWow. That was not biased AT ALL. I do not trust anything he said. Neither should you.\n100% agree with Earnest Lewis & I’m a white veteran\nAlso think my VA care has been excellent.\nSomething our draft dodger & President Musk could never understand\nYou’re going to do more, yet 1000 staffers were cut…I can do the math.\nDont send me this trump propaganda again!\nBullsh-t. Bullsh-t with a ” folksy drawl” is still bullshi-.\nSounds like a whole lotta my Republican fellow disabled vet friends are having some justifiable Buyer’s Remorse>\nWhy am I getting communication about Camp Lejeune when I’ve never been there. I just deleted them but they kept coming back.\n~7 years from start to finish to have 4 teeth implanted by the VA!! Pain clinic intern/student bends and lodges a computer controlled needle in my spine. VA sends me for an experimental surgery, effectively shortening my life span by no less than a decade. That is just a few examples of an endless list of how poor our care is. I have never had a good experience at the VA ! I’m no economic analyst but I fully believe our medical ” benefits” should become medical INSURANCE! The DOGE thing very well could save the country trillions by doing that. No buildings to buy, lease, upkeep etc. Reduced employees wages, and utility costs. Tons of savings from my point of view. I’m beyond disgusted with the fact we veterans sacrifice up to our lives for this country and we receive the worst healthcare this country has to offer. Rarely do we have a doctor for more than 1 1/2 years before a new one appears. no family doctor, no history, just a new face and start over at ground zero. Yes now all these colleges would lose the guinea pig practicing on the veterans to earn their degrees yet I thought this was for veterans not for colleges to train students on us. We veterans deserve insurance not medical “benefits” that don’t benefit us and guarantees us the worst healthcare we can get. Am I wrong or do we not deserve to have our own doctors that we and our family members build history and rapport with? Give us insurance instead of the word benefit, which truly means if we want professional healthcare, it will be paid for out of our pockets.\nWell, the VA is as full of bureaucracy and process that weigh down the VA from getting his/her benefits. They also have process that don’t make sense to get a referral that even the referral doctors at both ends don’t understand. They also have a system that doesn’t keep the Veterans involved and aware of the process of approving referrals aka request for services, that the vet has to keep calling and trying to find out where their request is and what is the issue, instead of an automated system that helps keep all involved in every step of the process. This avoids wasted time on both the Vet and customer service rep that doesn’t usually have the info, they are just a middleman/woman. Approving procedures, test, labs and consult in the community care process is very cumbersome on all involved (Community provider, the ancillary services, the specialist, and the Vet.\nMaking these processes more efficient would save money, time and headache for the VA, Vet and taxpayer.\nI’d like to know where the data is that Elon Musk and his team of unauthorized individuals took. Elon Musk has not been authorized by Congress nor the Senate but somehow has access to our records either directly through the VA or through the treasury which ties into the VA documents. I’d like to know what happened to my personal documents and I’ve a right to ask under The 1974 privacy act.\nWhat are you doing to protect veterans?\nWhat is the current status of my personal data and records?\nWhat is being done so that an individual who is not a naturalized citizen nor authorized by Congress or Senate will not have access to them in the future?\nWhy has the VA not put out messaging that says our data is safe and not in the hands of a third-party? Is it because it actually is in the hands of Elon Musk where they should not be.\nWhat has the VA done to make sure that there was proper vetting?\nAs you can see, I have lots of questions\nSince trump made the comment when visiting the allied cemetery in Normandy, about the soldiers buried there, I have been mad every time I think about HIS comment, ” THEY WERE FOOLS AND SUCKERS”. He BOUGHT his way out of Viet Nam. I did not and neither did the 53, 281 men and women who died there.\nGreat to hear. Maybe we can get a raise on out travel reimbursement.\nThen Why is my VA primary doctor after I lost my job my car my private health care telling me I am not paralyzed and the VA is not doing anything for me and to loose weight and good luck after I just lost everything!!! Good riddance in my book ????????????✊\nHallelujah! Information we can trust!\nPlease fix TriCare\nI trust flying on an airplane right now more than I trust your word. You’re a political appointee working for a serial liar who changes his mind daily and has no problem throwing you under the bus. Thank you for the reassurance, though, bud.\nAnyone who has to defend Trump and Musk is not an honest person. Mr. Collins is a politician who will say anything to stay in good grace with our first elected felon CINC. Disgraceful time for Americans.\n“DOGE” representatives at VA are neither qualified for forensic auditing, nor are their actions acceptable on any normal basis. As for the threat to veterans’ benefits, I don’t take the word of any Trump appointee any more than I would the word of Trump itself. Nor can you improve services by firing people wholesale. 1st thing I saw at the local facility Tuesday morning was a filthy bathroom, which probably used to be cleaned by a probationary janitor that was fired. I asked staff, and yes, probationary employees have been fired. I don’t know how many. “Improving services” is a LIE. “VA employees are reporting effects that include closures of operating rooms, reductions in the number of available intensive care unit beds, and cuts to inpatient mental health facilities. You’ve gutted the SUICIDE CRISIS LINE! If you have any self-respect you’ll resign.\nhttps://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/19/va-crisis-line-employees-among-those-fired-amid-federal-workforce-purge.html\nA GREAT choice for this position!!!\nOh wow, the new VA secretary is totally looking out for veterans—by gutting the workforce that actually processes their claims. Nothing says ‘supporting veterans’ like firing thousands of them and pretending that somehow speeds up their benefits. But don’t worry, folks! It’s all about ‘rooting out waste and abuse’—which, judging by the layoffs, apparently means veterans themselves. What a pathetic, bootlicking stoolie. You’re not streamlining anything, you’re just setting the stage for even longer wait times and more bureaucratic nightmares. Absolute disgrace.\nVets need a resource for issues and damages caused by VA providers, where the managers and chiefs cant protect them. That includes a way to get falsified medical records changed.\nMaybe, just maybe, the VA will finally approve benefits for my husband. He served in Vietnam and many years later was diagnosed with Cancer in his sinuses that grew and pushed up to his brain. He suffered severe nose bleeds and headaches so horrible he couldn’t even sleep. When we applied for benefits to help my husband, he was denied because the VA said we couldn’t prove it was due to Agent Orange and his type of Cancer was not on the “list” of covered Cancers associated with Agent Orange! Even though the doctor (ENT) stated it was most likely the cause of his Cancer, but how the hell does one prove that? The VA did tell him though, that if he was ever diagnosed with Type II diabetes, he would qualify for full benefits! The ONLY thing they approved him for was a cheap set of hearing aids. He lost his hearing and his teeth due to the Cancer treatments, but the VA still wouldn’t cover the costs of any of his treatments. Thank goodness we both had jobs that helped cover most of his treatments, but the VA definitely turned their backs on my husband.\nI don’t believe one word from a Trump appointee. I know damn well, that Trump/Musk want to cut everything possible to fund more tax cuts for the poor billionaires. I absolutely believe General Kelley and General Milley, that Trump thinks Veterans are suckers and losers. I remember everything Trump said about John McCain. So, how long before our medical care gets privatized? It’s a GOP dream come true. I get great care from the VA, as it is now, and I can tell you story after story about when the VA outsourced scheduling after the Phoenix VA scandal; I couldn’t get tests done, because the private company didn’t do their job.\nIt took 2 whole years after the awful private insurance company bowed out, for the VA to catch up on unscheduled appointments. My 2 ratings equal 100%, so of course I receive 80% disability. How long until these DOGE people come after it? I don’t believe that they don’t have access to our private information. How would you know? Musk has locked everyone out. There is zero oversight of DOGE.\nIf you believe anything they say, then I’ve got land in FL for you.\nAnd if you voted for that you are getting exactly what you deserve so stop whining.\nA couple of comments:\n1. I saw a report on CNN two days ago about a 10 year Marine Corps veteran who was working in a key administrative position in a VA clinic, cutting through red tape for patients, scheduling appointments, and ordering supplies, but was just fired. How is this suppossed to help veterans seeking or receiving care at this hospital. Who is taking over his duties? According to the Marine Corps vet, there was no time for a transition plan. If one expects the nurses and doctors to assume these duties, there is no doubt that access, availability, acceptability, continuity, cost-effectiveness, and quality of care will likely be adversely impacted.\n2. I am a 60 percent disabled vet and receive care in the community. I’m going on a month now waiting for VA Martinsburg to extend my community of care provider in endocrinology. Until this is accomplished, I can’t see the endocrinologist, nor order my insulin from the VA pharmacy. How many people were cut from the community of care offices?\nit’s too soon to tell, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt, But I am incredibly skeptical with anything DOGE touches. I haven’t seen anything but wildly outlandish claims not backed by any substance and reflex actions taken without any understanding of the consequences. To be openly accepting of what they are doing before they’ve really done anything strikes me as disingenuous and dangerous.\nThank you for the informative message. The wait me and other veterans have endured is too long. Currently I have an appeal that I had a hearing in late October that was filed in 2019. Another Appeal was just awarded in November of last year. Waiting and going through the various hoops is frustrating to say the least! Thank you and please improve this process\nWhy in the world should we trust Doug Collins, noted Trump sycophant since 2016, to tell the truth? Trump thinks we are losers and suckers, he absolutely does not care about us.\nFellow Vets, do not listen to these mercenaries. CYA and guard your assets. They will absolutely cut our benefits if it benefits them.\nThank you so much for the video! This is why the “bad” extreme left media just needs to be shut down. They don’t know what to do with their narcissistic minds, so they keep putting out bad information. There is something seriously psychologically wrong with them. They are not listening to the millions of people to do what is right with common sense. Just a complete shame!!!\nAlso, for the Camp LeJeun cases. If you have an attorney, they wait until they have 500 cases or more and then go to court for the day. The attorney’s are taking 30, 40 and I have talked with some that are taking 50%. There should be some law on that one a senator should put a bill forth.\nAnyway, thank you Mr Collins\nThen why did I just get told by my primary care doctor that all of a sudden I’m not paralyzed and there is nothing the VA will do good luck and lose weight????\n???????\nAnd we’re supposed to believe maga? Yea, right. Magatards are famous for telling the truth and not for baiting and switching at all. Man, thank you so much for your assurance and for your unabashed integrity. We’ll see how the future goes but I have no faith in bad faith.\nFor all legal purposes, DOGE is not a legal Department and should not any business reviewing anything related to the American people.\nAs I recall, that’s what the Inspector General’s are for. Because no one wants to stand up to the person who occupies the WH, everyone has to suffer. The President continually lies to the American public and frankly, it’s embarrassing.\nThe American people deserve better and especially our military and veterans.\nWhy should we believe that our benefits are off the table? He would do and say anything to save himself.\nThank you Secretary Collins. As an Army veteran and supporter of President Trump, I know that President Trump is the best friend of we veterans and that you and him will do the right thing.\nI don’t care about the cuts maybe they should and maybe we’ll better service too many veterans died because of the va not helping them\nThe new VA Secretary is obviously an arse-kissing TRUMPTARD. Elon is not finding waste, he is simply cutting things he wants to cut in order to get himself (and his fellow billionaires) big tax cuts by screwing real Americans. Over 1000 VA workers have already been fired. So the idea that we are going to increase benefits and improve services is a complete lie. Our so-called president is a wartime Draft Dodger who calls veterans Losers and Suckers – and this is how he “honors” real heroes.\nAs a disabled veteran, it took a year and a half to get approved. I didn’t know the system and realized I left out hearing loss tinnitus and sleep apnea so I finally applied for these things and got approved for everything except for sleep apnea which makes no sense it’s all about money. And that took another year so now if I appeal, it’ll take another 200 days to get an answer from my appeal. I think they’re just hoping that we die so they don’t have to pay out. I hope you change my mind. Thank you.\nYou are saying this to keep your job knowing that any negativity about the President will put you on the chopping block. I do not have faith that this administration will protect our benefits as they are already following everything else in the Project 2025 manual. You cannot trust anything this administration says or does.\nAnd what is being done to protect veterans’ jobs in government service?\nAlthough the VA might be maintaining benefits for veterans, my wife was employed through the VR&E program with the VA, and fought hard through her probationary period with the VA. She only had a little over a month left to go and was cut despite outstanding performance reviews. Although I believe that there are individuals taking advantage of the federal employment system, a massive cut of just blanketing probationary employees was not the way to go.\nI don’t belive a single word that you said. You were appointed by Trump because you are loyal to him. You cannot be loyal to him and the country, including all of the Veterans you claim to represent. You represent an authoritarian regime that is trying to destroy our country and turn it over to Russia. My father and uncles fought facism in WWII but you are embracing it by being loyal to Trump. Trump and Musk have already fired over 1,000 VA employees, including doctors and nurses, but you don’t seem to care that our healthcare will suffer as a result. How is taking medical services away from us while lowering disability ratings “giving and improving services.” How do we know that an unvetted billionaire or his unvetted teenagers haven’t already been at our medical records? After all, he’s aready received access to our Social Security numbers and tax information, so what’s to keep him from accessing our medical information and benefits? I know that you won’t, because you are loyal to Trump, which is why you were appointed. The plain and simple truth is that you cannot be trusted.\nYou are not telling the truth. Cuts will be made and the money will go to give tax cuts to the rich. You should be ashamed.\nI apologize, but, “Faster then ever?” I have had 2 claims in for almost 2 years… And another one in for 7 months, just to add my 18 yr old high school senior back on my dependent list, since he was taken off as soon as he turned 18…\nNot to mention, now my employer of 19 years, has recently made me fill out multiple questionnaires about my PTSD. Now I have been required to switch jobs and schedules within the Department !!! Hopefully whoever is in charge of the EEOC can make some appointments available within the time limits to file a charge for discrimination, but that doesn’t seem to be happening very quickly either. Although I WOULD NEVER, I’m really starting to understand why there are 22 a day that give up…\nThank you for the information,for the past four years the VA has been SILENT!!\nThank you, sir.\nI know the va has treated me great and will continue to do so my only concern is that it takes what seems to take forever to get paper work changed when you get a rating change just in my case I have been waiting for the va to add a dependent added sense July of 2024\nI hope its true you (Mr Collins) are here to help the Vet. Please, be honest with us the vets of the wonderful country\nThis bogus, of course doge is looking for CUTS going . All one needs to do is look at all the CUTS to varios federal agencies creating more danger for Country and devasting affect for families. Ask yourself why havrn’t programs paying the various contracts that Musk have with ANERICAN funding??\nI dunno man, the 1000+ layoffs at the VA that everyone is hearing about doesn’t give us a lot of confidence in what you’re saying. Frankly, no one, other than Trump and Musk can even say if VA benefits will be cut, because they are the ones in charge.\nThank you Secretary Collins for your reassurance that veterans benefits won’t be cut. It’s very difficult to understand why that would even be considered by our leadership. I am hopeful you will be successful ìn your thoughts for all veterans.\nI am a retired female Veteran. After reading most of these comments it saddens me that so many of us are waiting YEARS to get a reply concerning our disability claims. I ask you, why would anyone in their right mind ever consider joining any branch of service? We gave to our country and then the government just disregards us when we need help because of what we have experienced while serving our country.\nPresident Musk and his minion trump care NOTHING about the Veterans. He made that known when he called us, and I\nquote, “losers and suckers”\nI can tell you this, if anyone attempts to screw with our disability ratings you will have a war on your hands.\nThanks for tackling this mess at the VA. Ad a 100% disabled veteran I am willing to help out any way possible to get the VA back to a Premier agency. Sgt. Joseph Vary\nCollins is not being honest. They fired 1,000 employees. Just heard that they are rehiring 12 that were fired because they work on the Veteran crisis center.\nYou lost me at embedded subtitles. Back in the 80’s, TVs started including a button to turn on subtitles IF you want them. Online video sites like the one this is hosted on (YouTube) ran with that OPTIONAL subtitle button. And yet, so many places now force embed subtitles, completely eliminating people’s choice in favor of pandering to a subset of people who require or insist upon their ever presence. And yes I understand they help those with hearing issues or are in a loud workplace. That’s the target audience for the ON option of the subtitle button, give their freedom of choice back, and mine too. So no thanks, I will not watch your words dance in my peripheral vision while you speak. Write it in an article and save the bandwidth.\nAll you 2-4 year slackers can just relax. Stop bad mouthing our President and the efforts he is making to fix the damage the democrats have done. The cuts were long overdue to get rid of the lazy people at the VA that don’t want to do their fair share of the work. Once they get workers in those positions the care will improve. As a combat vet, I am embarrassed by some of the comments from the low life bad mouthing of the administration. Maybe that’s why you aren’t getting the care you think you deserve. Straighten up.\nThanks for giving the fact straight up. That’s how we like it\nAs a suggestion, I am a disabled veteran in Crawford county Pennsylvania, we got a new CBOC last year, just ten years after receiving a new one. When I asked about this I was told we will get another new one in ten more years, why? If upgrades are necessary, which I don’t really see any in this facility, but if they are, why not spend a quarter of the money improving the existing facility? How much could the VA save by doing this rather than constantly building new facilities? Use some of those savings to help improve the lives of vets decreasing medical costs, and thus creating even more savings? Just a thought\nANYBODY! that condones Trumps action is a LOSER! According to Trump, we, as Vets, are losers. This idiot, has to go.\nMr. Secretary, Trump and his minions have shown repeated disrespect to Veterans, both living and dead. For you to tell us that you envision no cuts to the VA programs, you are either a polyanna or you must be living in a cave. I look for them to cut some of the allowable meds, terminate the Community Care Program, to institute co-pays, and to make it more difficult for Vets to be granted disability. If I’m wrong, Mr. Secretary, I will apologize.\nThanks for that. I appreciate the “real” news straight from the source.\nUSA\nPlease respond to Sen. Warner’s and Sen. Kaine’s comments that veterans are the major work force in the federal government and will be the majority of those fired. Thank you.\nAs a retired Air Force vet with multiple VA claim denials, I’m so saddened and yet happy to see all the Vets on here posting their anger towards a department that is supposed to protect us and provide support.\nKnowing that my fellow veterans are angry and fed up with the current “administration” is a great first step and a group that can lead the way in clearing house. Please don’t lose momentum in this fight.\nYou don’t fire doctors, nurses, and hospital staff, thus causing appointments to be cancelled and ORs shutdown and then tell us it’s gonna be good. You are hurting us.\nI did not hear a denial that the CBO proposals are not going to be implemented. Paying for tax cuts for the wealthy on the backs of veterans is just wrong! A folksy video that seemed devoid of facts is not convincing.\nSo thankful to have veterans in our family, that use the VA services. We go to Hines in IL….grate for good care there.\nI wouldn’t trust Doug Collins with the health car of a snail! He is an unqualified tRump appointee and his only loyalty is to tRump, not veterans!\nDisgusting. You’re a disgrace to the uniform, spreading these lies on behalf of a man who just today declared himself king. The veterans posting about DOGE illegally firing them aren’t fake, but you are. Again, you’re a disgrace and so is every other enabler of this budding dictatorship. Sic semper tyrannis.\nDid they cut the VR&E benefits during Biden Admin. I got declined twice, been out of work, asked for assistance a 3rd time, was put in VR&E Independent Living Services and they sent me all these little medical contraptions that don’t really help with big issues. Asked about ILS grants to modify bathroom and widen doorways and my VRC said they don’t have a contract with any Contractor to do that so I could not get help with that.\nI applied for VR&E employment education & training, but was put in ILS? I even asked if I could get help with starting my own small Veteran owned business since VRC opined to not send me to school, and got denied on that too. Just got letter from VRC that says 6 months into ILS now they closing VR&E ILS case. Will the new VA Secretary review recent VR&E program denials?\nI’ll just be sitting here for a couple years before anyone gives a response? Very used to that, months and years. This is why private health insurance is a better option, when someone can afford it, V.A. wait times are absolutely ridiculously too long. It’s a broken system, and a good reason to never let Congress promote nationwide government Healthcare, cause that means civilians would see how Vets die from service-connected issues while waiting to be seen by a V.A. doctor\nThe VA should not be giving credibility to DOGE. Transparency? Who’s in charge of Doge? Who are the employees of Doge? Where is their government contact and security clearance? Why don’t we have the names and faces of these people?\nI am glad that you are at the helm Doug. I am confident that you will clean up the mess. I have a few concerns about the process and the contractors. Good Luck\nThanks to Sec. Collins for his support of all us Veterans\nI am glad that you are at the helm Doug. I am confident that you will clean up the mess. I have a few concerns about the process and the contractors that are reviewing my claim. Good Luck\nI don’t trust anything this administration has to say about not cutting veterans benefits. We already have a hard time getting appointments and they firing employees so how can we trust in this administration.\nThat isn’t what the budget plan from Congress says. Mr. Vought and the OMB are trying to cut funding. VFW, DAV, and PVA are advocating on our behalf while our leader ensures we don’t display any pride flags; a blatant display of disrespect to our LGBTQ family members and Veterans. Every single service member, regardless of lifestyle or preference, deserves respect and LDRSHIP.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins ;\nThank you, Secretary Collins, for your message assuring us that our VA benefits are safe. While I did not believe the Democrat’s or the media’s claims to the contrary, your message confirms my belief in President Trump, the Republican party, and your support in America’s veterans.\nLouis W McClure\nVietnam Veteran\nI don’t trust anything this administration has to say.\nIf DOGE is working on saving money, where are the forensic auditors, and why did they hire hackers?\nI want a REAL explanation of what’s going on without NONSENSE commentary about “media” or “mainstream media” bullcrap. Say it straight or I don’t care what you have to say.\nPlease look into VES, contract service, It is for the contractor to make a profit and have no way helping vets… They can make a appointment 30 days out, the vet has to live by a contractor’s schedule. Let’s make the VA about the Vet and not about a contractor making a profit.\nI’ve never seen a secretary veterans affairs sound like a snake oil salesman until now. WOW\nPlease allow dental care through the Care in the Community program. Dental insurance has limited coverage, minimal (50%) reimbursement and is very expensive (over $50 per month for Delta Dental). Allow veterans dignity and oral health via fillings, crowns, bridges and implants that can be provided by a local dentist. May God bless.\nThank you for the update Secretary Collins! I new you would do an excellent job! Can you cancel the new Gov ID program? It’s the same one the IRS uses and I don’t feel safe giving them that info. Besides the VA should take its own ID for me to log into my healthy vet to message my doc or order my meds.\nThe best way to stop this madness is to tell the men and women of the armed forces who volunteered and served honorably that they will not receive the VA benefits checks at the end of each month.\nAny way the docket can be moved along more readily for disability appeals? Retired in 2020 and still waiting.\nI have found VA Workers to be professional, kind. and hard working. Sometimes I am ashamed at the treatment they are given by other Veterans. While I did my duty to our country, It is you and the people serving under you we Vets need to thank “for your services” to us.\nIf you tie your performance and that of the agency to Trump and DOGE then you are immediately suspect\nWhat’s being done about appointments? I’ve been trying to get an appointment since September 2024 for my back pain and only get the run around when I call.\nThis guy is a bootlicking Trump syncophant. If you think for one second they’re not coming for your benefits you’re crazy.\nWhat about the VA employees that were fired? Most of them were veterans, I would appreciate it if you were hones and just stated the facts that Trump does not respect us. He has yet to apologize for stating that the CMH, id the same as the Presidential Medal Of Freedom\nWhen are you going to support the Service Dog Insurance Benefit? It’s time has come. Research proves the value of these special animals to veterans.\nWe all hope and pray that you are a man of your word. We have been wronged before.\nI want the real truth my husband has been gone going on 2 years I am trying to get his disability he was at 70% when he passed I guess they are wanting to wait and see if I pass away so they don’t have to deal with me I need help !\nWhat about my Health-E-Vet?\nHistorically, this President and his hand packed, unqualified stoogies, have a history of lying. Time will tell…same crap of blaming the media. The media so far has been correct on what they said a 2nd term of Trump would look like.\nAbsolutely thank you for clearing that up I’m a veteran receiving veteran benefits and it’s all I have think the good Lord and the government but this news is a bunch of bull crap so thank you for clearing that up and I appreciate everything you guys are doing thank you\nApparently, the VA is already cutting it’s own expenditures. I’ve had my classification and cut-off figure changed and for the second consecutive year, the VA is attempting to downgrade me to having to pay co-pays on my medications. With the meds I’m on, this would come to $400/month that would have to come out of my food budget, because that’s the only ‘budget’ we have. It seems that we manage to be just a few dollars over the adjusted cutoff every year. For over 20 years this has not been the case but now, with the budget shortfall, we’re suddenly being squeezed.\nIt has been two half years since the Camp Lejeune Pact Act was signed.I found\nout today my claim(lawsuit) will more than likely be the first of next year.I can not believe there are only four judges for 450,000 claims something needs to be done.All of these Veterans are waiting is the govt just waiting for them to die off?\nThe 10.8 million dollars of the Pact Act funds the higher up V.A. used for a raise 136 people I was told they did re coup 97% of the funds. Is there a new IG to contact?\nThey have no business being in any government computers. Is this the largest beach of data in US history.\nYou need to contact your congressional representatives and senators like I did. The problem with the PACT Act IRT Campaign LeJeune H2O contamination is it did little to set out the parameters for compensation. Whereas the VA established clear cut criteria for benefits and eligibility, the Dept of the Navy has not, and they are letting the courts establish those criteria. As you probably already know, this is going to take a long time, and frankly the evidence trail for people like my parents and myself who were exposed from the 50s to the 80s is ridiculously hard to come by. My dad already passed away. My mom’s in her 90s. Many like them, will pass on before these issues get resolved without additional legislation. Don’t wait on the VA.\nThe IGs have been fired\nNo! President Bone Spurs fired all the IGs. He wants free reign to disassemble democracy and not be accountable.\nThey being doing that for years. Why do you think Agent Orange took forever to be in lists for claimable things?\nThe money available is in the Billions, not millions. Payouts are anywhere from $25,000 to one million per veteran. I don’t know what determines the amount the veteran gets.\nI dont believe a damn word. Your wannabe orange king doesn’t give a damn about dead vets, hurt vets, captured vets… he said it himself.\nThe fact you even have to say anything about benefits is indication of bs.\nI agree 100% on them waiting on us to die. I’ve had my claim in since 1970 and can’t get anyone to do anything. Are they going to check on past claims? I certainly hope so!\nHate to burst your bubble but you need to know the truth. When Collins says they are clearing cases quickly, that means they are denying them. And then the appeals process begins. It’s been 10 years now for me with an 1151 case. (malpractice) You know what your case file looks like after several appeals (for bad info) looks like after a dozen of people have looked through your case and commented? You probably do if you’ve ever looked at the notes in your medical records after a visit. The amount of incorrect info is staggering. I haven’t given up but I’m assuming now this admin will deny it permanently. I doubt I live to see it. I pray all of you will eventually see positive results but it might be decades down the road, if ever under this administration. It absolutely is deny until death.\nI know it takes a great deal of time due to the fact that only 4 Judges hearing cases. I was finally approved after waiting more than a year. benefits were back dated and paid on when I filed. Once you are in the system it works great. I now have 100% of my health care taken care of at a VA facility and got a large lump sum settlement and my monthly tax free check is on my bank account on the 1 st of every month.\nIs there a way to contact your office directly with correspondence or is this the only 2 way communication?\nSir, will you ask Pres. Trump to please sign an Executive Order authorizing and directing the VA to finally recognize the harmful health effects from K2-Uzbekistan radiation as presumptive service-connected conditions? As you know, the serious issue of K2 radiation has remained unresolved now for over 23 years. Further, the 2022 PACT Act failed to adequately address K2 radiation. We, the disabled Veterans of K2 appreciate your and Pres Trump’s support in this critical healthcare matter Sir. We believe at this juncture that an Executive Order is the most appropriate and expedient means to finally address the K2 radiation issue. Thank you very much Sir for your time and consideration.\nI’m the spouse of a 100% service connected disable veteran that served 12 years and in the Persian Gulf War and they VA still has not added me as his dependant nor can I get my ChampVA until I’m recognized as his dependant. Who can I contact to help get this completed? I need medical insurance. It’s been almost 5 months!\nWhat I find disturbing is the constant praising of Trump and the dig at main stream media. That pretty much sums everything up. If it quacks like a duck… Say goodbye to your bennies, my fellow combat vets. This administration doesn’t care about us.\nGood luck to all of you vets that have remote doctors that are filling in because nobody wants to work in your local clinic or they can’t get good ones to come there..or they guess the previous one..when they force good doctors to leave the VA because of some stupid mandate to be in an office. Lol. As a vet I feel horrible for you. Good luck and God bless.\nGood luck to all of you vets that have remote doctors that are filling in because nobody wants to work in your local clinic or they can’t get good ones to come there..or they fired the previous one..when they force good doctors and nurses that brought the gap, to leave the VA because of some stupid mandate to be in an office. Lol. As a vet I feel horrible for you. Good luck and God bless.\nsomeone opened a can of worms. good luck\nCome on Mr Hochstetler, you know how this works. ONE way communication. You can try the Secretary’s hotline phone number, which goes right into an automated service and good luck to getting the right operator to connect you to the Secretary’s administrative assistant. Lots of SMOKE SCREEN and GASLIGHTING!\nWhen will the Camp LeJeune Case be funded? Many families have cases filed for years without any answers. Please make this a priority!\nThe Camp LeJeune funds are there. It is only four Judges hearing all of these cases.\nDear Mr. Secretary,\nMany people support efforts to prevent fraud, but veterans with hiring preference working for the VA or other federal agencies—many with over 15 years of service—have been fired. These terminations were not due to poor performance, as claimed, but because they accepted promotions that placed them on a one-year probationary period. As a result, veterans who have sacrificed for their country are losing their jobs, despite the protections meant to support them. These actions are being taken without consideration of the long-term consequences.\nWhat? That’s stupid. I would almost bet that TRUMP don’t know that.\nI’m also concerned about the Camp Lejeune litigation. Delayed justice is denied justice. We deserve justice.\nI am so glad that we finally have a person with our best interest in mind. I’m looking forward new and improved VA and I know all my fellow veterans are too . Thank you Mr Collins .\nDo you know if Trump is committed to assisting more Veterans that have been convicted of felonies since he is also a convicted felon? Can federal employees now also be convicted felons?\nYeah, how about the transparency of firing veterans with double digit years of federal service just because Musk said do it. Is that helping your veterans who happen to be employees too? Stand up for your workforce Sec Collins. I fought for my country and a South African billionaire is making these decisions. So much for my exemplary 18 plus years of federal service with the VA.\nSincerely,\nDisappointed, unemployed disabled vet.\nNuts, as a famous general once said.\nNuts. How many VA staff have been cut?\nHow can we believe anything said by this administration about anything! We are abandoning our allies and doing Putin’s bidding. You are destroying America and your empty promises to protect veterans benefits is laughable while Elon Musk and his lieutenants are the one deciding things.\nThat isn’t what the budget plan from Congress says. Mr. Vought and the OMB are trying to cut funding. VFW, DAV, and PVA are advocating on our behalf while our leader ensures we don’t display any pride flags; a blatant display of disrespect to our LGBTQ family members and Veterans. Every single service member, regardless of lifestyle or preference, deserves respect and LDRSHIP.\nI agreee with you one million percent!!! Thank you!\nEnough with the LGBTQ. Get out of here with that nonsense!\nOur Vet money and efficiency has nothing to do with displaying who you have sex with! we just need to focus on real issues not displaying our sexual preferences to all to see.\nHell yes.\n10/10\nWould protect above commenter in prison.\nTruth’s are better said than lies. With the transgender operations, constant medical attention, Mrs Cross are you going to pay for that medical expenses bill? In the military, at many commands, never cared who was gay, bi, lesbian, during the late 80’s. Don’t ask don’t tell, was a good idea. I do understand about marriage, same rights as a heterosexual would. Why, maybe you can answer this question. Why does the LGBT+ community have to advertise what is done behind their bedroom doors?\nThank you!\nRetired Navy Submariner. Heterosexual. I have a cousin who is gay n married, whom Since being my cousin with a tight knit family( aunts, uncles, cousins from both sides of my parents families.\nThey’re not going to fly my flag, why should they yours?\nWe don’t need to single out people for what goes on in their personal life.\nThe American Ensign and POW flags are the only flags that needs to be flown.\nThose two flags represent everybody.\nWhat about the firing of VA employees during their probationary period. Is this happening as we cut the government? How will this affect our care and services?\nAmen…I’m with you on this. All Veterans means all Veterans.\nLGBQTXYZ, get their recognition on Veterans Day just like the rest of us\nNobody cares about your sexual orientation (or anyone’s). Thank God President Trump (& Secretary Hegseth) has focused our military on doing the job of being a leathal fighting force – not some social engineering experiment on queers.\nLol mental illness\nExactly this. Thank you for saying it so clearly.\nCry me a river ! If you full inclusion why the Hell do you feel that you need a “SPECIAL” LGBTG PREVENTION NUMBER ???Use what all the rest of us use !\nThis is about veterans. Not your lifestyle preferences. You get as much respect as anyone else. Deal with it.\nNo person of sound, rational mind truthfully gives a s*it about the LGBTQ “family.” Have those persons nothing greater to celebrate in their lives than their sexual preferences? If that be the case, what a meaningless, unproductive life they live. Have they accomplished NOTHING greater than deciding who they decide to share orgasm’s with? The entire LGBTQ scene is a disgrace to humanity for celebrating a personal preference that absolutely NO ONE cares about. GMAFB, ms. cross. Bravo Zulu for getting rid of that disgraceful pride flag.\nThank you Mr. Collins for fighting for our right as veterans. We, the one that serve are very grateful to know that the benefits for the veterans are not going to be affected by this new presidential changes. A lots of us depend on the veteran’s benefits.\nThat sounds like fake news. Trump won’t cut veterans benefits unless one of those entities is skimming money off the top. I hope he finds it if it’s there!\nMichelle, #1 Mr Vought and OMB are Cutting waste not Funding where it is needed. #2, I am a Gay man my self.\nI am for What the Standard Norm Was before DEI, the LBGTQAI+++ alphabet that all but ruined the Military with its Demands.

Thank you for having the COURAGE to post your comment. Retired US Navy CDR.\nThe only flags that should be displayed are the U.S. flag, Military branch flags and the P.O.W. flag. No need for anything else.\nThe American flag represents them just like the rest of us veterans. Did these veterans fight for our country under the gay pride flag or the American flag? When I was in Vietnam I fought under the American flag.\nYou are a liar, there are no cuts.\nDear Mr. Secratary\nIt’s my understanding from reading Military.com that President Trump is following recommendations from Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. While I agree with rooting out fraud, waste and abuse and think DOGE is doing and excellent job. I am fearful of Veteran’s disability compensation being radically changed! I AM AGAINST ANY REFORM OR CUTS to disability compensation! I am a total and complete 100% disabled veteran and retired! Veteran’s have sacrificed more than any other segment of the American population other than maybe law enforcement. As most retired Vets are on a fixed income any disruption to that income could lead to catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Veteran’s have earned every single penny of their compensation and under most circumstances had to fight the bureaucracy tooth and nail to get it in the first place. I beg you please do not vote yes on any bill that would include changing VA disability compensation in any way shape or form. There are PLENTY of other places to cut spending without the continued sacrifice of our Veteran’s. Thank you for your time.\nMichael S Jordahl\nUSA, SFC Ret\nOver one thousand VA probationary employees were fired in the last week as part of DOGE ruining everything we have.\nDon’t sit there any say nothing is being cut. Cutting the workforce is harming veterans.\nAgree..many veterans concerned about means test & 30% getting eliminated. We all followed orders and have the scars visible or not. Contrary to popular opinion, VA disability is NOT an entitlement program.\nI’ve been trying to find more info about the means test. From what I understand capital gains could be counted as income. So if a vet bought stock and wanted to sell it to pay off a house or buy a fancy new car it could actually cancel their benefits! If the means test comes true they could use 2025 tax info.\nMilitary.com is owned and operated by Gannett. The same people who operate USAToday. They may have military in the name but they are no more reliable than USAToday. I would take anything there with a grain of salt. And if someone is appealing to my sense of fear? They are probably trying to con me.\nHard pass.\nDon’t believe you.\nHe full of sh-t just like trump. He is lying to our face just like his boss trump. This guy is has no honor, respect and honesty every time him or his boss president elon / trump open their mouth is lies. He and his bosses trying to bring back BS choice program which is garbage. I used it before and it was nothing but garbage and I could have had everything I needed done by the in half the time it took with choice and they still never got it done right. No wonder the VA got rid of it before under president Biden. Trump ruins everything he touches like the VA. Leave the VA alone you can’t fix what is not broken and trump does not fix anything so stay of the VA system!!!!\nInspectors General are how you root out fraud, waste, and abuse, not by having people with no concept of how the government works take a hammer to things they don’t understand. Audits are done with forensic accountants and subject matter experts. Elon has a bunch of JR tech bros, one of which was fired from a previous job for giving away company secrets. Btw, Trump fired all the IGs.\nI wish I could shake your hand. That was the best way to say what all us vets are thinking as I sit in a hospital bed right now due to my injuries.\nI think they should cut it all including the Vet benefits THIS IS WHAT WAS VOTED FOR! so let’s see it through.\nDo let us know how that goes. I expect him to swoop in at any time since he really will need your vote again.\nYou haven’t been paying attention: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/john-kelly-confirms-trump-privately-disparaged-us-service-members-vete-rcna118543\nYou’re getting exactly what you voted for, and we tried to warn all of you this would happen. Congrats. You voted against yourselves.\nFine words – but why all the layoffs? Don’t be too surprised when they try to privatize the VA.\nSo, it’s ok for others’ income to be affected. Just not yours. Maybe they served their country honorably as well.\nIf you think DOGE is doing an excellent job then you shouldn’t be surprised when DOGE finds a lot of fraud at the VA that results in reduced or suspended payments, or worse, for veterans like yourself. DOGE has successfully eliminated programs and employees we once thought were indispensable. They’ve already fired 1000+ VA employees. They will be heading to the VBA with the same intent.\nThey need to revamp the disability requirements. Too much glorified welfare. It should be LOD only.\nYou need to send your letter (comment) to your senators and house rep. The head of the VA doesn’t vote on bills. That’s congress’s job.\nYou deserve to be cut off if you think they’re doing a “wonderful job.”\nSo veterans being fired in huge numbers from federal employment is fine because it doesn’t directly affect you?\nThese firings includes nurses and people at the veteran’s crisis hotline, which will affect vets using VA Health Care facilities and those suffering from PTSD or other mental health issues. We either care about vets or we don’t – it shouldn’t matter how it affects us individually.\nCollins is just another suck-up, yes man for Trump.\nYou support Trump and DOGE yet fear having your benefits cut. Get real man. It is your support of these guys that will enable the cuts.\nWow! Our personal information is at risk of being exposed to hostile actors, DOGE is, was, and continues to be a front used to create mistrust in our government agencies, and hard working ‘Mericans are losing their jobs as part of a failed attempt to balance a budget consistently and historically ruined by the GOP…and still there are those that support this type of nonsense. Except when it applies to them. Let’s see who continues to support what, as access to all of our traditional social services are slashed or elimated so those pesky tax cuts don’t expire.\nI’m with you my brother!\nAmen! My husband is a 100% Disabled USMC Vietnam Veteran. He’s been on the poisoned water national list since about 2007. He was told back then if there ever would be money, he would be entitled. When the lawsuit started, we contacted our present attorney. They know how long he’s been on this list.\nWow. Then you just care about your benefits and nothing else Trump and Musk are doing to destroy this country from within?\nElections have consequences, I’ll have to accept what comes with it.\nYes you want the cuts…but not to anything that will affect you. As a disabled vet I also do not, but you somehow think that as long as it does not affect you, its okay to cut them. Im sorry that you lack compassion and empathy for others….which is what the men in charge suffer from as well. You do not think that others losing their jobs are facing catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Shame on you. The man in charge will not be reading your comment….he has better things to do than care for veterans.\nHow is DOGE doing a good job? It’s not even an official federal agency. They are terminating essential workers on false pretenses and claims, causing chaos, destruction, anxiety, and hardship on regular working class people. This entire administration is a coup and whoever they elect to oversee programs, including the VA, they are only minions who follow every unconstitutional law given to them and disregard ethical policies that were put in place only to overturn them and eventually cut standard benefits to veterans and civilians alike. It’s only a matter of time when they start looking at va disability benefits and the recipients who are receiving those benefits. They definitely have access to our personal data and healthcare records. They don’t care about veterans. And why would they, especially Musk!\nThe Sec Def. Has no vote on anything. When Trump and muskrat come for our disability, there is nothing Clins can or will do about it.\nConsider than less than 1% of payments were erroneous in the last 7 years according to the IG, DOGE isn’t doing a good job: it’s a farce to distract from their egregious behavior\nYes, I’m STILL fighting this battle. It is absurd the amount of crap we have to navigate through, wait over a year just to be told no, didn’t happen in the military. Then, it is up to us to hire a lawyer to help fight it. This whole process works against the veterans.\nthere is a concerted attempt to privatize VA Healthcare; the vipers want to convert it into private and for-profit un-healthcare of the sort that exists in the private sector. VA Healthcare in my expereince is far superior to the private system and for a simple reason: inside the VA Healthcare system people are there to help people and not to make profits. I’ve heard that comment from many physicians and nurses who have worked in both.\nMr. Collins doesn’t give a tinkers damn about veterans. He works for Musk and Fat Donnie the Fascist King. I expect that by 2027 the new American King aided by the NAFP, New American Fascist Party will have so decimated our system of government that even our military and those who have suffered and died will become meaningless. In my opinion Trump and Musk plan on dividing the world up three ways. China, Russia, and the U.S. will each control 1/3 of the globe. My question to Collins is WHAT THE HELL are you going to do about it?? Do you even care? Are you simply overseeing the dismantling of the Agency designated to provide care and assistance for those of us who served our Nation? I believe that you’re the chosen sucker. After your mission is complete you WILL be tossed aside like a box of garbage. You Sir are a fool. May God save your soul…..if you have one.\nGood Man ! ?\nHis lips are moving, he’s a republican, he lying while some unelected billionaire technocrat robs us all blind. Faster case fliw? That means they are denying us.\nDear Secretary Collins, I am amazed that veterans are being let go from the VA. I see many of those veteran types working at the VA hospital in Decatur Georgia and I would hate to see them lose their jobs because of some fanatical, cutting efforts by this administration. I hope you will take action to preserve, the opportunities that veterans have to serve other veterans in our VA facilities.\nI agree Captain. When I worked at a VAMC, I saw more non-vets who were a waste of a position. Their attitude was, “after my years probation I cant be fired”. Many non-vet employees live by that code at VAs.\nBeen bothering me also.\nIt is too late. They have fired all probationary employees with no reason with a note in their termination letter saying they were fired due to underperformance, and that is just the beginning unfortunately. They are also making cuts to Medicare which all tricare for life recipients ultimately transfer over to. Anyone who thinks this will not hurt veterans are not thinking clearly and assuming this guy is being honest will be severely disappointed.\nLiars, all of you. Letting are constitution fail while you watch.\nI completely agree with your comments and feedback. The same thing is going on in Florida, VA regional in West Palm Beach. Right in the PODUS’s Winter White House backyard. You would think King Trump and the Secretary would preserve these low paying jobs since it is already extremely difficult to recruit qualified personnel that understands the unique administrative, physical, mental, spiritual, and financial needs required by our military personnel. Just try to explain your situation to a civilian network provider. They just want their money for services!\nI completely agree with your comments and feedback.

What about our Democracy, and all those Vets, including my grandfather, who fought and died for it, against Fascism in WWII. Now you embrace it. After all of the lies that Republicans have told to me in my lifetime, I would not believe anything more that you ever have to say. I became a United States Marine and I am still a Patriot but You support Billionaires over someone like me. Money is your God. So far there has been zero benefit for my service but then I chose honor\nand principle over money. A love of my Nation. Unlike you. I don’t count on you helping any of us. There has been no Justice for the loss of my child at Camp Lejuene. No Justice for anything. I hope that you believe in a Just God, I do. Men like you are going to answer for all of it at Judgement. You still believe in your lies and have zero repentance, no change from your sins. Cuddle with a dictator for worldly wealth and status out of fear. Refuse to help the least of your brothers. Play God in your decisions. No better than those who murderered the Jews. No better than those who condemned Christ to death. No forgiveness from the Lord God. Unforgiven.\nYou are a clown ?. Crawl back to your Circus\nUnlike the ungrateful comments that support the previous missing in chief, i feel its wonderful that we are rooting out fraud and waste. Even if that means laying off VA employees. In fact, it would be cheaper to issus us a card accepted by outside doctors and hospitals for community care.\nWhat did the last 4 years of Biden get you? Go ahead I’ll wait.\nI have to admit, there is a lot of truth to what this person is saying. The mega men and women in Congress and the Senate have violated their oath to the constitution. They have turned their backs on democracy and have supported a traitor, a felon and a hollow man, and just like him they have no moral compass, no values and no character.\nHistory will be especially hard on these people, and any veteran who has his sense of self will be willing to go through the last full measure to ensure that these people never rise to the top.\nI served in the US Army and am a 100% disabled Veteran. This is the most heartfelt, brutally honest, beautiful way I have heard someone describe what the unabashed sledgehammering of our Constition, our Democracy, our lack of ethics and compassion is doing to the very fabric of our existence. I beg of you to share this beyond here. It needs to be read by the people. And if you don’t want to do it or remain anonymous, I would be honored, as one battle buddy to another, to share this with others.\nSorry I don’ t believe you sir and DOGE, Elon & Trump can all go to hell.\nHere are things that need to change at the VA. I have been going to the N.Texas VA in Dallas for over 25 years. The doctors there have almost killed me 3 times, and it is all in my medical records. 1. Stop hiring unqualified foreign doctors. The Dallas VA is full of them. 2. Make it easy for Vets to get outside medical help, when we can’t get it at the VA. The way it works now, and the way it is set up, is a total nightmare. I have diabetes and I’m on blood thinners. The orthopedic doctors will not see me half the time. I need a shot in my knee every 6 months so my knee will not grind bone on bone. They have refused to see me the last three times I have ask. This has got to stop. These doctors are there to help us, not turn us down. 3. The service we get at the Dallas VA is shocking. I just told you about one problem. There is many more. The Dallas VA is good at covering their tracks on problems like these.. We need a lot of changes at the VA in Dallas.\nYour left wing liberalism hate is showing. President Trump and Mr. Musk, no matter how much money they have, are trying to save America. Do you live in a cave? Have you not seen all the wast that they have found? If they don’t fix it. You want have to worry about the VA, America will be broke and there won’t be a VA. The U.S. Government now employees over 50% or the working population. We can’t have that. The government was NEVER suppose to be that large. The government should never employ more than 38% MAX. I suggest you crack a book and learn the truth and get off of CNN and MSNBC.\nHear, hear! I’m surprised that the censor allowed your comment. They’re blocking mine. They’re afraid of “dangerous” ideas being seen by other, like Orwell’s 1984. Thanks, Big Brother!\nWow, this country was founded as a constitutional republic and the democracy you speak of was formed within the republic to turn the country into a corporation. So I will ask you take the blinders off and do little more research. Both parties have failed this country and some of the rotten leadership have been in office for decades. But don’t take a word I say to heart I just ask you to do you due diligence and research. Not everyone is bad or has bad intentions, and if these people don’t do good for us then I will join you in the tinfoil hats brigade and vote in some new that will more then like replace and repeal all that being done this time around. But there is moving to another country. I even have researched if this country fails US like I have experienced in the last 3 years cause I when from 70% in late 2020 to be to 90% in early 2021 to 60% in summer of 2022. So tell me how Mr. Collins is the problem\nPerfectly said!!! So very sorry for the loss of your child.\nThis is the same guy that said the VA “will not be cutting any employees.” So I agree with you 100%, I can’t trust this dude either.\nOh, really.\nWell Said. I couldn’t of said it better myself!\nFirst of all, thank you for your service. Secondly, your comments are so out of touch with reality. President Trump very much respects our servicemen and women, and if it weren’t for him and serving as our President 4 years ago, our VA health system would still be in dire straights. He fixed a broken system, and now our Veterans are receiving better care. Please do your research.\nDidn’t the Jews kill Jesus? You must be a troll op on the Internet, but cool story though, Bot.\nYes! I agree with everything you stated! Lip service as vets lose their jobs! Pathetic they will answer for all their stuff!\nHi J Medley. First I am so sorry for the loss of your child at Camp Lejuene. There have been a lot of injustices in our country, and long wait times to get claims finalized etc. but in all seriousness you can’t blame that on any one party. Your remarks about Trump and our new Secretary are so wrong on many levels. You are simply spewing what the liberal media have been dishing out for so many years trying to eliminate Trump from becoming President. Look back – two assassination attempts, two impeachments, endless lawsuits, special hearings etc. – All failed. Millions and maybe billions of taxpayer dollars spent on trying to derail the man. I’ve been in politics so I know the game. I have to close that you are in no place to think God is on your side and against Trump and the Republican party. Despite what you think Trump really wants to make this country great again. I get the fact his personality may rub you the wrong way but give the man a chance. Since you seem to be a Godly man, put him in your prayers that he does a great job for everyone. Have faith and hope he does the right thing!!!! Best to you and yours, a Vietnam Vet\nYou’ve bought into the propaganda, “Trump Bad” is the mantra. If there is any “fascism” it’s in the Democrat Party, the self proclaimed Socialist. I feel for you brother, please open your eyes to the truth –> “Trump GOOD.”\nAlthough you have a right to express your opinion, this rant does not possess one ounce of facts to support the accusations. This extremist approach does absolutely nothing but cause unfounded division. Stick to the facts, keep an open mind, and read a variety of news sources to create a more balanced viewpoint.\nBy the way, there are worse tyrants throughout history than the recent dictator in which was referred. At least try to spice it up a little with some ancient Roman, Chinese, Russian, or Mongolian oppressors. Continually comparing others with the same old name is unimaginative. ;)\nYou are blaming this administration, how about the previous administrations?\nYou are very misled, but I can tell you for certain that under the Biden administration my benefits went to hell. My prescription drug copay almost doubled, and I couldn’t/can’t even make an appointment with my primary care doctor without going through some stupid person that doesn’t even work in that office. I don’t know where you get your information, but you have no idea what you are talking about. You sound like an idiot with the crap you are spewing.\nYou’re just an America Hating Sheep that believes Everything the Lying Fake News Tells you !!\nAmen! My ancestors fought in the American Revolution and most wars since. This administration has no idea what they have done but they will soon. I don’t think there will be a civil war because this isn’t between civilians ( except the “cult”) but the oppressed will rise up and show the billionaires the error of their ways. History is on our side. 1776.\n“I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut,” Collins said. … “I’m happy to partner with DOGE [an un-elected organization that was not created by the US Congress as the VA or USAid was, just an arm of Elon Musk’s business empire] to find things we need to get rid of…” he said.”\nWhat BS, first Collins says he’s not cutting VA benefits…then he says, oh yes, by the way I am cutting benefits, we’re just calling it “efficiency”…literally on the same page!\nSecretary Collins is just a stooge for Musk, our N- co-president from South Africa. He is appointed ‘secretary’ to take an axe to the VA benefits we EARNED by our sacrifice. Trump, a Vietnam draft dodger, has never respected veterans and does not honor our service. To Trump and Musk, we are just “suckers” (Trump actually said this!). Wake up people, this is all in the project 2025 playbook. Musk-Trump wants to kill the VA dead so that we have to deal with their golfing buddies/ vultures who own the private health insurance industry. All while betraying our allies in NATO and selling Ukraine to the Soviets. RIP America 2025.\nJ Meadly Sir, Seems you’re looking to blame certain individuals for the loss of your child. Many lost loved ones concerning the Lejeune issues and or continue to suffer. There is never true Justice after suffering a loss as yours. We do need to heal and as in the Marines, continue to move forward.. I do strongly suggest you seek counseling. The VA has the means and am certain would like to speak with you. Good Luck.\nWell put my friend!\nI agree with you 100%. I was at LeJeune as well. I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Good lord above. ?\nAll of this feels like a full on tail spin. It takes cptsd to a whole entirely different level! And the Veteran’s suicide hotline has already had some operators cut! As if their jobs aren’t absolutely necessary. And they wonder why vets isolate. What a joke-what a slap in the face!! I WILL pray for you and your family.\nWell said My Brother, well said!\nI created the Desert Storm Battle Registry as a survey in 1997 to\nfind my fellow GWI veterans. More than 5,000 filled this out. Then\nI progressed to full advocacy by 1998. By then DOD knew me quite\nwell as I inventoried there servers and threw it back at them. I was tired\nof not knowing anything or why I was so damn sick.\nDSBR name tags, and name plates began to fill boxes from events that\nI was recognized at. Media was easy back then. No one turned me away.\nTill global media coverage in 2003 opposing troops going to Iraq. Even\nhad a DC PO Box for mail.\n2008, got my own VA federal advisory committee. VA went out of its way\nto shorten our tenure and muzzle us. Even threaten me, then pretty\nmuch hide our committee and its final report.\n2012 VA cut us all off. Played dirty with gulf war advocates. Ran off our\nadvocates in favor of ringers. All the while making things worse for Gulf\nwar vets and playing up Deployment Health. Who have been hiding 4\nsignificant disease trends from the veterans and the public.\nHere it is 2025 and Im still here. Out lived hundreds of advocates and\nfellow supporters. Still, DSBR hung on for 28 long years. Of which VA\nhas gotten very braisen. Not posting my letters to the RAC year after\nyear likes its a choice. Taking down all evidence I exist the last 3 years.\nI find it highly offensive 14 Secretaries of VA have ignored everything Gulf\nwar from a veterans stand point. That we have no real say in our care,\nbenefits, and healthcare. You will choose for us. None of you have done\nright by me, or the 697,289 other fellow GWI vets. Going all the way back to\nPL 105-368 that you twisted and abused.\nMust be very comforting to look down your nose, and act like DSBR does not\ndeserve professional courtesy. 28 years of work means nothing. What could I\npossibly offer versus you? Try 28 years of experience and dealing with 13 other\nSec of VA that like you felt veterans input is a joke. Every damn one of them was\na public servant and forgot that when it office. Your supposed to be available.\nTechnically, Im your boss. Not the other way.\nSo I will say to you what Ive been saying back in the Army to officers. How could\nyou loose what you never earned, my respect. You demand it, then you treat me\nlike a feral dog in back ally. You want my respect now, earn it by doing your job.\nWhich means answering phones and emails. So far, zip there. DSBR came along\nway before you, and Ive helped far more gulf war vets than you ever will.\nWe started out nice 2 weeks ago, and now I know 2025 is you cutting throats,\nhiding behind staff, pretending to care while you pretty much spit in my face.\nBlocking my browser access to VA.gov is also blocking me from MyHealthevet\nwebsite. Your denying me access to medical care. Real brave, real smart. So I\nthink Im justified to be grumpy with you. I only get this way reacting to others,\nI didnt start this. Just reached out to you and you blew me off..\nChange is coming either way.\nKirt P. Love\nDirector, DSBR\nFormer Member VA ACGWV\nDidn’t you hear? https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/john-kelly-confirms-trump-privately-disparaged-us-service-members-vete-rcna118543\nEat [redacted], fascist.\nThank you, what they don’t want us to know is the fact most Vets of Desert Storm are like myself. We were some how connected to a Bradley Fighting Vehicle or M1 ABRAMS, or some other mechanized source. The US Army conducted a study in 1981 on the two tanks mentioned. This study revealed that just firing of the weapons alone Carbon Monoxide was lethal at every position within those tanks. The DOD, and Army refused to do anything about it other than ignore it. Myself I have suffered from Rumathoid Arthritis every since Desert Storm I was 11M. I enlisted at 17 fresh out of High School healthy as an OX. Thru my own studies and research there is a known link to CO poisoning and Rumathoid Arthritis. I have a TERA MEMO attached to my file and conceded to by the VA, but none of that matters, it’s just a piece of paper. Come sit with me some times when it takes all I got to get out of bed because of the pain I am in. I have accepted the fact that RA is chronic and it will take my life someday if a cure is not f going. What I can’t accept is the very Government I defended and would do it again in a heart beat as most of us would, now I’m having to defend myself because nobody with Authority has the balls to stand up and do the right thing for us Vets. It’s always some other law it more red tape, I didn’t recall any of that when I was called to fight a War we really had no business fighting in the first place! Mad as hell at Army,DOD, and now the VA is falling right in step with those two. Grow a pair do right by the very people who gave you a job to begin with or resign and put me in that seat!\nThey may turn a blind eye, but we are still watching. Thank you for the advocacy over the years, Kirt. GWI (or whatever they want to call it) has been a nightmare for so many.\nYou have my undying respect and admiration Kirt. I also had to voice my displeasure to superiors while serving which didn’t serve me well. You seem to have the ability to voice your opinion and stop. My mind demands my adrenaline push me beyond that and display a much firmer view for my point of view.\nU.S. Army Vietnam Vet\nWell over 80% disabled and find the VA extremely lacking to the point I’m convinced I’m just a photo op.\nPlease focus on the Caring for Survivors Act as so many of us lost not only our loved one but also a substantial amount of our income\nYou want the VA to focus on the survivers moreso than the actual veterans? Many veterans are single and single with families and cannot work but yet you feel that its more importants for the non-veterans to get the disabilty that the actual veterans need? Im sorry you lost a substantial amount of your income but I lost the ability to have children because of military issues among other issues so Im not losing an additional income..Im losing most of my income, my home, and may be facing living on the streets if they cut the benefits. I WAS in the military, not just married to someone in it. PS…when I could not have kids my military husband left me to find someone that could.\nCurrently VA has over a quarter of a million pending rating cases, which is taking an average of 140 days to complete. Is that faster than ever? Historically, VA has staffed up during wartime periods but when those employees retire service suffers. Veterans’ needs for VA services do not go away after they are discharged. Many times as veterans age, their needs for disability benefits and health care increases. It angers me that Elon Musk and his wunderkind, none of whom served one day in the military, are attacking the VA. Shame!\nThis empire was built off of the blood of those who served in units like mine, and you better f***king know that we are not oblivious to you trying to f**k with our disability ratings and services. Keep that in mind. You can lie to the masses with the current administration’s lies, but you won’t pull that s**t with us vets. Remember that.\nLess w 0ke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with w 0ke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nA lot of vets voted for this admin. So the wool has been pulled over their eyes and quite easily, unfortunately.\nI second that!\nSadly, some of these Vets are delusional and have fallen into the cult.\n!!! You speak the truth, unfortunately\nIf one comment from here could get the attention of anyone in a position of authority at the VA, let it be Mr. Hirth’s.\nStick your hand in our cage and pull back a stump.\nHow is freezing hiring for the WARTAC program, and taking medical services away while lowering disability ratings “giving and improving services.” You can’t BS us. We are what sustains this empire. Active or reserved… You’d do well to remember that.\nI don’t believe a word the Sec. is saying. He’s just another puppet of this administration & the so called “DOGE”. I’m very worried about the outcome of all this stupity and the future of our USA. Take care & carry on.\nSecretary Collins ,\nI don’t believe your going to read any of these emails. I’ve reached out to Congress the VA representative, and my Congressman in Texas with no results. I’ve had 3 botched surgery’s from incompetent surgeon’s. Now I have to suffer the rest of my life and I don’t trust the VA at all thank god for community care. As far as I’m concerned the Government has given up on us and has given everything to illegals and Fu$k us.\nI will continue to fight for my country and what I believe in\nDear Sir,\nThere are 182 comments on here.Are you going to answer any of them?\nLOL… Don’t hold your breath.\nHe’s not reading them-they don’t care, I promise they don’t. Tomorrow, thousands more will lose their jobs in America while the Felon in charge whines about when he’ll get his new Air Force One delivered—because that is government efficiency:)\nmy brother, he is not even going to read any of them.\nDo you actually think he is going to read them? Sorry your comment was pretty funny. Let me answer you as a disabled veteran. NO, he is not going to answer you. He is probably having his very expensive coffee with his amazing breakfast chatting about how hard his job is and cant decide what kind of furniture he needs for his new office.\nNo, no he is not. But you kinda knew that, didn’t you\nYou wanted this job, now do it\nPlease Exend the Blue Water Line to the original Vietnam Service Medal Line that was took away from Blue Water Navy off Vietnam in 2002. This was the agent orange 1991 Bill for all Vietnam Veterans. I been trying for almost 20 years to get my Benefits. I got a lot of Health Problems from Agent Orange and Toxins on my Ship. I am almost 78 years old.\nMy husband is like you. VA doctors told him to file because certain illnesses, like prostate cancer, he had would be automatic because of Agent Orange. When documentation was filed, weirdly, VA kept saying they didn’t get them. They seemed to get records that were not needed. they also close the case if they don’t get what they want by a certain date. We filed through Texas Vet who took the paperwork and handed it to the VA office and still they wouldn’t acknowledge they received them.\nHow can we possibly believe anything this fascist government says. The president just declared himself king! DOGE was given unrestricted access to records. We have a HHS that wants to put those with mental illness in camps. How can anyone believe this!?\nGreat. Just another bootlicker kissing POTUS butt.\nOne of the slowest entities on this planet is the VA . It takes an average of 6 months to 3 years to get an answer from the VA in disability claims. Molasses going uphill in the winter time on Mount Everest is faster than the VA. Such a disgusting way to treat veterans that literally give their lives for the defense of this great country. And you wonder suicide rates are so high. Veterans have no choice but to give up. It would be nice if one of the largest health care systems in this country could ACTUALLY take care of its veterans. Please pass this on to the VA boss and maybe for ONCE he will ACTUALLY listen to our concerns.\nPeople commenting like he gonna read it lmfao.\nAs I read I wa liked lol. Some are writing a yrs of what they did.\nWe know he’s not going to read them. We know no one on his staff will read them. We know he doesn’t care. The comments are for each other to hear the voices of their compatriots.\nThis is why I would never vote Republican. The sheer stupidity and depravity is an insult to those who served their country. I understand that you rich white scumbags feel that I as a black man can serve and die for my country but I do not deserve to be treated equally. We as black people have fought for this country since its founding and still are treated as second class citizens. Your recent cuts to the VA are yet another example of your disregard for our service. It is my hope that Karma shows how much of a bitch she is. You are led by a 5 time draft dodger who called us suckers and losers, however it is my belief that you are the suckers and losers and I will stand on that until I die…\nAbsolutely. They’re not gonna read any of this stuff, but I’m really enjoying reading what my fellow veterans are saying.\nAwesome! Thanks for posting\nAmen brother!\nAs a white veteran I have to tell you that they don’t care about any veterans no matter what color. I do understand that you may have faced prejudiced issues in the past…so have women, and its not right. About the rest of your comment…I agree totally. Im also nog a fan of old rich scumbags who are robbing us blind to their advantage. That’s why I am up all hours of the night filled with anxiety, depression and questioning if tomorrow they will be coming after us.\nlol shut up, all this garbage has been given to us from all the previous generations Dem and Rep combined working for their globalist overlords have crushed us veterans and made the VA one of the most corrupt institutions on earth, and now all of a sudden 30 days into Trump you’re gonna cry about Republicans and “waaah white people” when the VA has been an institution of death and depravity for the past several decades? Get lost, you’re nothing more than an anti white ideological hack.\nNow you know how my Irish ancestors felt when they were forced off their lands and taken into slavery to serve in the New World. My Celtic brethren were called and treated as sub-Human till 1830s. So been there, done that.\nUp to 20,000 Irish were worked to death to hand dig the New Basin Canal in New Orleans in the 1830s because African slaves were deemed too valuable to risk. In 1862, the US Army project to build a canal on the Mississippi River during the War to bypass Confederate Army batteries on the bluffs of Vicksburg. It was dubbed Grant’s Canal, but after the first failed attempt, that quickly changed to Grant’s Folly. Undeterred, General Grant secured President Lincoln’s approval to force recently “freed” African slaves to hand dig and dredge the adjacent wetlands. It is recorded that 200+ of these men lost their lives for this useless project that was always doomed to failure.\nIn the end, we are all cattle to the powers that be. Race and nationality have little to do with it. Democrats aren’t much different from Republicans. They both belong to the same Progressive Party.\nsounds like this one needs to be audited. Bet your claims are fraudulent\nYou can’t fire (without cause) over 1000 dedicated VA caregivers then pretend you actually give a dam about our health care or convince us that you won’t also come after our disability benefits so greedy never-served billionaires (like Musk) can shove even more billions into their pockets. Trump may hate us “suckers and losers” veterans because (being a pathetic coward) he ain’t us. But WE will outlast him!!\nMr. Secretary,\nSince there gas been a staffing shortage of doctors, nurses, and support staff. Why did you layoff 1000 workers? For transparency “Why are you afraid of Donald Trump? As for Elon and his SpaceX techs. No I highly disapprove of non- or improperly vetted civilians that has no clue whatsoever they are doing to have access to my records or any VA records. To be honest you, Trump, Elon, and Republicans in general are an embarrassment to this country. Elon is from South Africa and not from the US. Having access to all these records and making decisions hurting America’s workers.\nI hope they do away with this glorified welfare system. Unless your disability is LOD you shouldn’t get any. This could save the govt billions. I hope they take a hard look at this.\nwe HAVE to Make America Great Again. There will be pain for sime but I totally support the cuts. there us so much waste and fraud and faking. billions and billions\nHello, my name is Alfonso Perez. A Disabled Combat Veteran in South Texas. Since 2010 I have submitted documents in support of a claim. I was in combat as an Infantryman during the Gulf War. When I was discharged, a clerical error did not show my medals that I deserve and served for. Mainly, my Combat Infantry Badge. This is important to me. I can pass this on to my kids and grandchildren. Showing that I served my Country. For years, I have been fighting the US Army Vital Records Department and Board of Appeals. I have emailed and talked to several offices and departments, hoping to get help in this matter. Mr Collins is the only person that can help me at this point. I also been fighting the VA over my failing and declining health. I have pictures and my statement where I was exposed to the burning oil wells and burning material that we were tasked to do. I have been complaining of shortness of breath, bone and muscle pain from day one. When I filed a disability claim in 2007. Although I am 100% disabled due to combat, I suffer from several illnesses. The VA has helped me in getting an electric wheelchair and a lift for my home. I am bed ridden 90% of the time. My wife has been caring for me the past 3 years. This is when my health has worsened. I applied for the caregiver program, and have been denied several times. There’s been time I want to give up. But my wife motivates me to keep going. PS I also believe my injuries and illnesses should be awarded a Purple Heart. As it was a tactic used by the enemy. God Bless and Thank you!! Alfonso Perez (Mission,Texas) 18th Airborne Division/24th Infantry Division Aco 3rd/7th Ft Stewart Georgia\nBrother, your wife sounds like a saint. I had luck getting my dd214 updated through military awards section of manpower.\nI feel you brother! I did ask about the Purple Heart as well. NBC warfare was used against us on multiple occasions, M8 alarms, Khamisiyah bunker filled with sarin gas. I too, believe we deserve a Purple Heart. Your CIB should be easy to prove with your DD-214 showing your time in Desert Storm and your MOS. Send a copy to HRC to get it fixed. Oh yeah, file for Aid and Attendance instead of the caregiver program.\nGood Luck.\nDear Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collin’s , I was so happy to hear that you are now the New Secretary of the Va. Cherry Point Base had referred me to the VA in New Bern, NC. after seeing 5 Jag Attorneys at Cherry Point Base with President Trump placing my case Under Major Domestic Violence April 2018. Congressman Murphy office in Greenville stated they would be glad to help when I had a claim . Sir I do have a claim that Honorable Senator Dole, Craven county DSS had assisted with in 2008 with Winston Salem VA. I understand that you are a chaplain. Sir this situation is not God, it’s evil. Thirty years of the quality of my life and family is completely destroyed. The course of our lives have been changed unnaturally. Since President Trump had taken office I have had to notify the President. The only assurance that I have received is from Craven Community College, very little assistance from DSS , and one of the families from the college assisting with one of their familiy members temporarily, with staying with a elderly. I have also contacted Randy Forbes law office in Washington DC Greenberg Traugrig as they taken my consideration rights, civil rights, liberty rights, fundamental rights, with them not honoring the rule of law. I would definitely appreciate any assistance that would be given as they have me trapped financially. Thank you\nWe have no proof whatsoever that an unvetted non-federal employee working under the fake federal entity DOGE that was not even Congressionally created (as lawfully required)…has not illegally accessed our super sensitive military Veteran medical records, disability records and personal information contacting our SSN #s, birth dates, address, phone numbers, etc. I do not believe anyone hired by the current president, a convicted felon.\nAwesome! Thanks for posting . My feelings exactly! Where is the accountability?\nhave you ever been to the DMV????\nPlease – you are assuming that any other federal employee is honest and good. What we do know if our country is in deep financial trouble and DOGE has the smartest people on it to comb through waste, fraud and abuse to save our taxpayer money. So quit whining and realize how licky we are to have these 2 great men working feverishly to save America. They are plenty rich enough – they do not have to do it but they must for our kids. By the way, 58% of Americans approve of Trump and Elon’s DOGE. DOGE employees are employed by the federal government as hired by Trump/Elon.\nThis…right here. Absolutely.\nWe need to have our Vr@e. Benefits expedited.\nVeterans have to wait for 5-7 months for any sort of vocational rehabilitation. The offices of Greenville SC are completely closed and when I went in person to the physical office, there is a schedule sign and a government vehicle. The department of the Veterans affairs educational benefits needs and our health care benefits are slow and veterans are dying waiting for the proper care!\nPlease work with Doug Collins together so we can fix Greenville SC. CBOC and build another hospital for veteran in the Upstate south Carolina!!\nChatGPT said:\nCertainly! Here’s a revised version of your message with a clear and professional tone:\nSubject: Urgent Request for Expedited VR&E Benefits and Improved Veteran Services in Greenville, SC\nDear [Recipient’s Name],\nI am writing to bring urgent attention to the current state of Veterans’ services in Greenville, SC. Veterans in our community are facing excessive delays in accessing Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) benefits, with wait times of 5-7 months. This situation is unacceptable, as it severely impacts veterans’ ability to transition to civilian life and gain meaningful employment.\nIn addition, the Greenville SC offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are completely closed, leaving many veterans without support. During a recent visit to the physical office, I noticed a schedule sign and a government vehicle, but no available staff to assist. This lack of accessibility is only furthering the frustration of our local veterans.\nOur veterans are also facing delays in receiving educational and healthcare benefits, leading to serious concerns about their well-being. Tragically, some veterans are dying while waiting for the care they rightfully deserve. This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue.\nI urge you to collaborate with Congressman Doug Collins to address these issues and expedite the process for VR&E benefits. Additionally, I implore you to work towards establishing a new VA hospital in the Upstate of South Carolina to better serve the needs of our veteran population, particularly those in Greenville.\nThe time to act is now, and I trust you will prioritize the health and well-being of those who have served our country. Our veterans deserve better.\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter. I look forward to your prompt response and action.\nYou Have 2 Senators And A Rep. Collectively they Will Be More Than Happy To Expedite All Concerns. Lindsey Graham/Tim Scott/Nancy Mace. They Are Dedicated In Helping Veterans Of All Military Campaigns. The Above Individuals Are Dedicated to Transparency. Good Luck!\ni think it wonderful that the military has decided to consider to right some of the wrong judgments unfair decisions handed down,most vetrans didnt join the military to fail or qut to get thrown out, , we sighn up in all honesty to succeed , for life careers , to lead productive lives , some unfortunate veterans may have fell short in some of there endeavors and encounters during there service , or for various other reasons , weather you couldnt get along with your higher ups, because of biases ,racism , mentel illnesses ignored ,harrassment/ mst ,ptsd, fraternizing , seen and judged by one person veterans not being given the chance to redeem or get medical help in some instances counseling, instead of just being thrown out most veterans dont want to leave fail go home failures ,the process were flawed mental health wasnt recognized., ptsd wasnt recognized untill 1980 , many veterans suffered mentaly it was ignored or went unnoticed there were no proccessin place ,this is not a hand out,, it is a hand up, to our fallen misfortunate stigmatize hidden wounded soliders ,there were discrepancies ,prejudices inconsistencies in the discharge process, so i think it was over do. good luck to those veterans who suffered for years carrying this hidden wound, being look down on frown upon, rejected, not able to get jobs, ,because of differences between two people from different backgrounds cultures etc , because of mentel conditions at the time of said events or a behavior sustained from trama ptsd mst ,harrassment, fraternization,\nAs a wife of a Veteran and I feel to just vent my feelings here. I wished that if my husband’s PSA level was thoroughly examined and monitored closely like yearly mandatory check up for males I believe that He would not start His Chemotherapy tomorrow, 2/18/25.\nIt was 7-1/2 years laps His VA doctor didn’t check his prostate until His PSA level became very high and cancer cells was present that ended him getting Prostatectomy surgery. My husband had several infusions, injections and oral meds but the cancer had metastasized to his bones. Now Chemotherapy is needed to hopefully stop the spread to his organs. I hope that this comment helps improve the dignity of patient care in our Virginia Veterans. I believed that negligence of care is present in my husband’s care. I’m very sad to see Him undergo many treatments.\nI thank You for allowing me to share. God Bless.\nFile a TORT CLAIM against the VA for negligence. It is not hard to do. Gather your evidence and submit your form.\nGood Luck\nI’m very sorry to read of your plight. For any veteran men here, just do what I did – doesnt cost a ton of money – go to Quest labs and pay for your own “PSA blood test” and if the result is oitnof range get that to your doctor and that will start the action going for diagnosis. Too many wait around or trust in the gloved finger test. Just pay for your own psa blood test. I did and thank God we caught my husband’s PSA was very high. That triggered a prostate biopsy which was a gleason score showing aggressive type, so then a staging nuclear medicine bine scan and visit to surgeon at City of Hope for robotic removal. And get this – the doctor at that initial medical annual physical was not going to give him anything because he looked so good and healthy and strong. But I was the one who pushed to write to get the blood test (more accurate than digital rectum exam). My hunch was because he was not having good solid urine streams – yes I heard a change in his urine stream “habits”.\nMay God bless your husband and you. I wish him the best. I too got Prostate cancer, possibly from Agent Orange exposure but who knows. I’m lucky it was caught early, treated with radiation/hormone therapy and is in remission. Even though I have a primary care doctor at my local VA Clinic, my civilian Urologist called out the cancer diagnosis early with my sudden high PSA level. Take care brother.\nI’m sad to say I really no longer trust the VA Administrations. No issues with the doctors, nurse at the facilities but the senior leadership.\nOnce again the senior leadership within the VA will need to earn my trust. Zero trust in DOGE\nDOGE found hundreds ( if not more by now) of upper level case managers working from home, using personal computers ( not DOD secure) to access VA account information and sensitive information… Along with the lack of security measures by these admins they were only working a few hours a week while still taking a full salary….\nCriminals running VAMC Caregiver authorization . If you’re dying, you’re not a problem for long and if you’re dead, you’re not a. Problem..\nDOGE it out of Existance. Criminals that never approve a single Veteran for caregiver help. Absolutely anti-american, against Veterans that need caregivers that are blind, and have all the problems with activities of daily living..\nCall me\n1SG Combat Vet, Caregiver\nThe VAMC Caregiver program is criminal lengthy weights, obscenely long interviews just to say no.\nThey need the doge now and eradicate its staff completely. I help take care of Veterans. It is a salmon and swim upstream and you know what happens..\nThe rule is if you’re dying, you’re not a problem for long and if you’re dead, you’re not a problem\nVA should loan on tiny Homes for Veterans on wheels. There are too many veterans that are homeless, and never could afford a five or $600,000 mortgage, but they may be able to afford $125,000 government sponsored Tiny home on wheels with their service connection.\nI was rated at 100% disabled (service connected) back in 2012 before I was discharged from the military. I had a major depressive episode due to bipolar disorder and TBI with mood disorder. Not to mention that my career was done due to my 2 lower back surgeries and 1 cervical surgery that led to a prosthetic disc and fusion in my neck. Dealing with the constant pain and the plethora of consistent changing medications, I had a suicide attempt that led to me smoking some pot. The Army violated Army Regulations and Command Policy as well as some other nefarious acts that led to me being taken to a special court martial to adjudicate a BCD as well as threatening me with 4 years in a military prison. Having a wife and two children, a home that we had bought, and watch many other soldiers get wrongfully disciplined by command and getting unfavorable discharges, I opted to take a chapter 10 in lieu of the court-martial. I found out later on after having the chance to actually look at my records, I found many mistakes and other discrepancies in my discharge that I can say with the utmost conviction, my discharge was wrongful. My DD214 is so messed up it will take forever just to fix that one document alone. After my exiting service with two terms of service, the first term of 3 years 4 and a half months under honorable conditions and a second term that was 3 years 2 months of service cut short and getting a characterization of OTH, I went to the VA 3 days after my discharge. I wanted to find out if I had any entitlement to benefits at all. I was told by the VA that I was entitled to no benefits at all. Not even unemployment. I went back to the VA in 2015 in another state, which was my home of record and found out that I could get medical benefits for any injuries or conditions being treated for while in service. In 2018 I entered the DOM to stop drinking and tried to apply for my GIBill. The college I was wanting to attend told me that I didn’t have any GIBill benefits because of my OTH discharge. In 2021 I found out that I did have my GIBill benefits through another education institution. However the VA wants to short me 10% of my GIBill benefit. I did a patient inquiry into my VA records in 2022 and could not believe what I found. The VA has me showing that I have no service connected disabilities and that I have had no surgeries what so ever. I started going through my medical records from my disability claim while in the service and am appalled by what I am finding. The incorrect information, the false statements by physicians, the refusal to use my tri-care paid off post mental health providers diagnosis that the VA at the time was treating me for, the policy violations from Army Regulations and Command Policy on soldiers that are in the MEB/PEB process and the VA IDES process, finding out that MEB/PEB and VA disability determinations were purposefully withheld from the General Court Martial Convening Authority when the disability processes were completed and before my court martial was even read to me. These disability finding are supposed to be taken into consideration when a soldier is taken to a court-martial not to mention that I had a daughter that was enrolled in the exceptional family member program for autism. The program I was in was a Joint DoD and VA program while going through the evaluation process. I have contacted the VA and DoD and they both wanna play “pass the buck” and not take responsibility for the indiscretions they have both committed. Let’s also add that during the time of my evaluations the Unit I was assigned to “a pilot program” was being investigated for multiple issues. I have ran into more issues for trying to do the right thing and point out these issues through my own personal experience as well as documentation that proves what indiscretions had been done against these soldiers. I have solid evidence of it and I can’t get a soul to look at it. I have been played so many times by my health care providers when they tell me to bring in any documents that I want put into my health records. I bring them in and no one looks at them. They had me believing that they didn’t have any record of my medical history from the Army. Then I find out that they can pull them up at any time. Why would they stress me out like that? I called the main VA in DC to get transfered 4 times, the person I spoke with told me they have no record of my claim filed back in 2011 or my ratings in 2012. I find that odd when I have all of my records to include the original claim filed in 2011 that is date stamped received by the VA in Winston – Salem plus the entire packet filed with the MEB/PEB and VA DES including my NARSUM, QTC exam reports, and MEB/PEB and VA Findings and Ratings, a signed DA199 that shows my paperwork was withheld by the signature date alone. Can we say, “denied due process” and “railroading”?\nDaniel are you living my life. I was Deserted by my command in March 1991 as other unit members witnessed this. Then it all got turned on me and mysteriously all the unit records vanish. Then comes the ol Chapter 10 OTH I would have been better off at Court Martial. I was straight out denied records by the DOD until I got my Congress rep involved in 2006, but they even have him the ol bait n switch move cause the records he got were nothing more than fire starter. Imagine my surprise in 2023 when yet again I request my Congress rep to get records and I think somebody made a boo boo for the first time in 33 years I learned the name of my accuser. Your not alone brother Chapter 10 OTH is no where remotely close to the bulls eye of Justice and that practice needs to cease immediately. any one that is facing these issues we are stronger together than apart hit my email so we can ban together and demand answers and change in this new Golden Age!\nAre more judges going to be appointed for the Camp Lejeune Claims and lawsuits which are at 450,000 and it has been two half years?\nThe 35 year time frame is it a law ?

He is the best doctor I’ve ever had. I don’t know what I would do without him.\nThank you standing up for us vet\nNaw, only a few of them. Don’t forget there are also minority Vets who won’t get anything and will have to fight for the same rights as their fellow Vets.\nI have a concern for housing right now I’m pre-planning for move out and I urrentlg reside in the south bay area and would like to move to treasure Island I hear there are housing opportunities slved there and I wanna make sure I get placed where I wish to live. Any help answerijg this question would be greatly appreciated\nSir\nNobody notified to me to get tested ever after Desert Storm and now all these years later I find out I am sick from it. My driver has been 100% disabled for YEARS but now I am filing and have to fight tooth and nail for my family. I don’t have a positive outlook so I am filing more for\ntheir future. I have been sick for years and you need to do better notifying us before it’s to late like now. My health is in shambles and now I have to battle on my claim!!! I can’t believe this really was done to vets who would do it again for their country.\nCollins, you’re a liar like the rest of them. We don’t trust you. And all the overreach of DOGE that you’re allowing to happen? You’re a freaking disgrace. You must really think we’re stupid. You record a video with your cheery southern twang thinking you will win us over? You won’t. We aren’t sheep.\nOnce you were sick you should’ve started seeking treatment and follow up care. You waited until the PACT ACT was available for the bells to go off in your head. Like most GW Veterans we were sick almost immediately upon return. We noticed the changes and sought care only for Dr’s to tell us we were crazy and it was in our heads. It’s not too late for you as every condition is presumptive by providing your DD-214 showing your service in theater. It’s helpful to have those diagnoses’ but not required. Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue, IBS are all presumptive.\nSo why are you cutting doctors and nurse who are on probation? It is hard enough to get this group to apply for jobs in the VA. I am very concerned about the state of the VA for our veterans. I am a retired VA nurse who loved caring for Veterans. My late husband USMC/VN died in 2004 due to Agent Orange exposure: non Hoskins lymphoma. It seems that the current administration in DC is not listening to the “boots on the ground “ employees, those nurses and doctors and health techs who care daily for our veterans. The VA is not a business: it involves real people : who put their lives on the line for our country.\nI hope veterans will wake up to see how the VA has been privatized for decades. —with decreasing benefits. And that Congress for the 7th year will NOT cosponsor and pass a Dental bill (HR 210) for all veterans in the VA healthcare system. I am told “too expensive”. Check out who has signed onto this bill.\nDealing with a doctor that lost job because of the morphine he was writing, he left me no choice but to quit myself. I ordered CBD off Amazon & failed urinalysis from taking supplements. That was 2013 roughly? VA will not pay for pain medication because I’ve since got my Medical Cannabis Card & get in prescription. The VA hasn’t paid for my medication since I quit the morphine the doctor prescribed (180mg 4times a day) . If I hadn’t thrown away I would not be here. Was up to 370lbs. Please look into why Veterans get punished for pain medication because of the THC? The first thing I did joining the Navy was I had to get a waiver for using in high school for the government. My mother said always be honest & here’s a good reason why? I like a pain patch but it costs 90$ a month. Paying for my own medication has hurt me, also recovering from Storm. Being punished for CBD is outdated & another reason for the VA to say no? Would like to help other Vets as well. Very Respectfully Sir thank you\nPlease check on why the higher V.A higher up Admin used the Pact Act funds for a raise 10.9 million? Marsha Blackburn V.A.Admin website. Why are there only four judges overseeing the Pact Act claims lawsuit 450,000? Who made the ruling 35 year time frame when it was 1953-1980.Thank you so much for your time\nMusk would love to know about the 10.9 million..\nHow can we trust anyone appointed by Trump and his co-president Musk. There is no truth anymore. I doubt any of our data is safe.\nMany veterans who have injuries caused by their military service should be taken care of. From slipped discs to the most severe in which they lost limbs. Its the honorable thing to do. I don’t understand how non-veterans who dont risk their lives can even ask to take away any benefits from veterans. The way I see it…send those kinds of people into combat or have them unload heavy equipment all day year round which eventually breaks down their body. Once they have their injuries..I bet they dont want to be abandoned. Its not even just physical pain… as the years go by… veterans get so freaking angry their pain is non-stop and they can’t do what others can do. Get jealous of injury free people older then them jumping around. Can’t even stand without freaking muscle spasms/cramps or annoying headaches. And it gets worse as you get older. Filled with nothing but regret.\nSecretary Collins, first and foremost, congratulations on your appointment. I was hoping to send you an email, but that seems impossible. Not sure if this will reach you, but hopefully it is relay to the leadership team associated with the VA facility. I am a retired veteran, USMC. Looking through these posts, there definitely is some bellyaching, I am sure some is warranted. I just want you to know on how employees at the White River Junction VA in VT, go above and beyond. I had an appointment on Wednesday at occupational therapy, I also was scheduled the following day to get my hearing aids. There was a pretty good snowstorm rolling in the following day, and I knew if it was going to get as bad as predicted, I would not make my appointment. I took a chance and went to audiology and explained my concerns, the staff up front were professional and got an IM to my audiologist. She cut her lunch break short and saw me. Hearing aids issued.

Please say no.She says her friends are being fired as she texts me. And her job will be eliminated by 2027.?\nGut VHA and give us insurance, community care is trash and the approval process is a nightmare for veterans and the providers who get paid $.27 on the dollar for services. As a provider I wouldn’t want to deal with that crap for a fraction of the pay. Just saying. ?♂️\nDear Mr. Collins,\nMy husband, Clifford Oliver Mealy, is undergoing treatment for service related bladder cancer. He served in the Navy during Vietnam. And applied for his benefits in 2023 after he was diagnosed.\nHe has not been able to work. His business as a photographer has faltered because he is unable to work.\nHe was told that his benefits would come in a year. Now it’s two years and he has yet to receive his promised benefits.\nThen, he received a letter that his benefits have been “deferred.”\nWe cannot get anyone in the VA to tells us what this means.\nNeedless to say, this is very upsetting as his diagnosis has destroyed his business. And we have no idea when this will be resolved.\nThis needs to stop we need all employees who work at VA with these cuts now we are going to wait longer for all dr. appointment, compensation reviews VA was already short hand now it’s even more if you want to make cuts look at the contract that the goverment has with vendors, look at Elon Musk and how many contract he has with the goverment and how much he made off the goverment.\nMental health “professionals” are just treating Veterans with legitimate issues with very little concern. They rush Veterans through these unhelpful programs rather than addressing the actual problems to fill their books. I would like to see a change where they take quality over quantity.\nTaking anything away from veterans is shameful especially when the military budget is so large. Cut that in half and give it to the veterans! We are being told that people working on the veterans crises line were laid off! You are lying to us Collins! During Trump’s last presidency he was found to have lied more than 35,000 times! Each lie has been documented. Stop believing what he says! There are people working the crises lines at the VA and they are saying that they were fired. I think I will believe them before I believe you or Trump. You don’ care about the veterans. Neither does Trump. I wonder how much he is paying you to misrepresent the truth.\n“The Trump administration is right now firing researchers at VA who do lifesaving work for our veterans—research to prevent veteran suicide, build lifechanging prosthetics, address opioid addiction, and more.\nLoved this! Straight forward right on target!\n… and have enough respect for the dignity of the office to put on a blazer!\nJane, get a life!!!\nPlease focus on Fraud Waste and Abuse. I guarantee there is tons of money spent on veterans who have passed away who are still being sent disability compensation.\nI’m a huge supporter of Pres. Trump, and I’ve been generally pleased with his agency/dept picks. However, in response to a veteran friend’s concerns about “cuts to veterans’ services and benefits,” I pulled up Sec. Collins’ video above, and I was wholly unimpressed and underwhelmed by the Secretary’s drive-by remarks and his folksy, gee whiz attitude. It struck me as arrogant (“I’m so smart I don’t need preparation”) and lazy, too lazy not to have developed SPECIFIC AND SUBSTANTIVE rebuttals to the left’s SPECIFIC allegations.\nMore directly: Mr. Secretary, Pres. Trump has given you this incredible honor and entrusted you with this grave responsibility to lead this august Department in serving our treasured veterans, women and men to whom we owe the highest debt to provide them and their families/caregivers the very highest quality healthcare and service. Lack of preparation and lack of seriousness is disrespectful and is not going to cut it! It might be fine to “wing it” or “phone it in” as a commentator on a news show, but it’s not appropriate for this position! Going forward, if you don’t actually KNOW the specific allegations leveled against the Department, then be smart enough to have your deputies brief you first. Then PREPARE your remarks WITH SPECIFICITY, before you go on camera. Your response was not only vapid, it was embarrassing. I was therefore forced to go elsewhere to address my veteran friend’s very real concerns, to which she was entitled to receive a responsive, quality, SUBSTANTIVE answer. Until your staff can bring you up to speed, here’s a simple response you could have given (though we should be able to expect far more from you, since you head the Department – you should be the resident EXPERT on all things V.A.!):\nhttps://youtu.be/1K9X4lHIFgE?si=z1Q-yC-7ctgUCaJx\nPlease relay all of my remarks to the Secretary.\n“At VA, we are focused on saving money so it can be better spent on Veteran care. We thank these employees for their service to VA. This was a tough decision, but ultimately it’s the right call to better support the Veterans, families, caregivers, and survivors the department exists to serve,” Doug Collins.\nAn Oxymoron statement to say the least…you’re a used car salesman (no offense meant to used car salesman) you will say anything to accomplish your ultimate objective just like your Commander and Chief ( Project 2025 ) Zero hope for a fair and impartial government and VA. And by the way cutting Veterans from their jobs is truly heartless. Dick move Doug! Why not start with the 10 million in bonuses for the upper echelon in the VA. I wonder!\nThe buck stops at Trump, he chose this guy. He should be held accountable for his poor choice. He also chose the OMB head, who is the real threat to Veteran’s benefits.\nI have one word. BULLSH-T\ngulf war veterans need a reform act in 2025/2026.\nis there feed back ?\nWe are in need of help from the top\nThere is a “Scam” on the disability claims on the veterans. I have been fighting it for over a year and a half with minimal outcome. My local VA veteran advocate is a Star, but the data input center in Janesville Wisconson is a constant “let down”. The failure is the VA hand-off to private 3rd parties for the “confirmation appointments.\nI’d be glad to share the details with a real Military Veteran in Secretary Collins office if someone can contact me …\nCollins is full of it and services will fall significantly. Our government leaders are liars, who maintain control by continual misrepresentation. Too bad the many believe others because of their own inability to control themselves. Do not expect anything from our government because it has become self evident that those leaders can only enrich themselves by screwing those they supposedly represent\nLies lies lies. People have never waited longer for their benefits to be approved, you won’t give them the services they need or medications, and make disabled people drive for hours to see a doctor that can’t do their job because of your policies. You should be ashamed to stand there and lie like that you monster\nSounds like someone with a Bad Chicken Dinner, eh?\nDishonorable discharges get nothing from American taxpayers.\nTrump administration begins mass firings across government\nFri, February 14, 2025 at 9:28 PM CST\n“more than 1,000 at the Department of Veterans Affairs,”\nHow does firing 1,000’s of people at the VA help improve services to us?\nConcerned with taxing VA disability that was proposed in Dec 2024 – this would greatly impact many disabled vets and their families. Spouses who get CHAMPVA due to their vet spouse having P&T 100% disability should be able to use the VA facilities. Meds by Mail under CHAMPVA take close to 3 weeks to fill prescriptions.\nDear Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collins, Thank you for your service. I personally have had a hard time receiving assistance after going through major domestic violence with one of your Marines. Honorable President Trump with his administration April 2018 placed my case under Major Domestic Violence. Cherry Point Base referred me to the VA in New Bern a few years ago. Congressman Murphy office stated they would be glad to help when I have a VA claim. I do Sir that Honorable Senator Elizabeth Dole and the Department of Social Services assisted me with in 2008. They have a copy of my claim, yet nothing. I have lost my dad as a United States World War Two veteran, my mom, two Aunts and I was told I would never see my brother a live. They took many years of special occasions and holidays away from me. They changed the course of my life and family unnaturally. One of the biggest problems is they have my domestic violence money and compounding it and spending it their project with making thousands off myself and family every day. They continue to give my husband federal money and benefits after the Trump administration placed my case under major domestic violence. NC is a 50/50 state with out domestic violence issues. Major discrimination. I have been in and out of homelessness while owning property which there was a mistake on. They have taken away my constitutional rights, liberty rights, civil rights, fundamental rights and denied me attorney. I have contacted Randy Forbes with Green Traurig in Washington DC with notifying President Trump, With the United States Supreme Court as they continue to take my life and family for money. The only assistance that I have been receiving is from Craven Community College, while attending, DSS, and a family from the college to assist in care giving to one of their families. I have been staying with a elder for the last few months. Sir I have requested mercy and grace from President Trump as this has cost a total of 30 years of the quality of my life and family. A few years ago I had spoken to Diane from Winston Salem VA as they do know that this was major domestic violence with one of their marines. Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collin I am requesting mercy and grace from the VA to have closure on my case. Thank you.\nI deal with the VA in Hampton I get my medication‘s by Mail from Hampton my doctor is in Hampton Dr. Chip route and I don’t have no issues with the VA I get 100% disability from the VA for ancient Orange Vietnam and now I got chronic bronchitis That I filed another claim for but when I get my medication I got all this paperwork with the medication‘s which I don’t think they need I always throw it in the garbage I think they should go paperless when they’re sending your medication’s to you just about every veteran knows what their Vedic medications are for I think they should cut back on the paperwork that goes in the mail that ends up in the garbage it’s costing the money to print it cost the money to buy the paper for packaging all the paperwork is in the package when you get it with your pills good luck to all veterans and the va .vetnam vet\nAbsolutely true! The reams of paper sent to me (with my name and address on every page) is completely unnecessary. Maybe only when the medication is first prescribed and perhaps once a year at renewal would suffice? As it is now, the bill for paper alone in the Pharmacy must be a big hit on the overall budget.\nYa’ll believe this if you want. Musk is running it all and is making millions a day on government contracts. They don’t care about vets or anyone that’s not elite. It’s all part of Project 2025 and put it out there. Ya’ll done F around And Found Out. People want to blame Trump, but he’s so far deep in, clueless and he’s lost control and only doing what’s he being told.\nThankyou for taking care of the Veterans.I am Vietnam Veteran.I was over there from earley 1968 to 1970.I had two tours with the 39th cav.The VA has been very good to me and still are.Thankyou very much for all the help they have given me.\nI don’t believe a word from you or the Traitor and his clowns.\nSo…you were pleased with the dementia patient in the Oval Office the past 4 years?\nDonald J. Trump and JD Vance are patriots.\nSo many on disability that musk or Trump don’t care about am afraid\nNeither served\nTru\nO called the dead losers and suckers\nBought his deferment from the draft. Bone spurs. Don’t let them hurt the veterans that suffer.\nToo bad the VA doesn’t treat TDS. Because you got it bad! Get help before you stroke out.\nWe need a New Greenville Clinic here in South Carolina in. There no Staff, No warm AC, NO cafeteria, not enough services. and Our Veteran cannot find any VR@E services available! the Negligence is above and beyond! The chief of staff and Medical Director of Columbia need to be replaced as of yesterday!!\nThank you for the update. We need to do something about the rating system for service connection. I’m currently rated at 70% for PTSD, 50% for my feet, 30% for my lung (gulf war veteran), 10% for hearing, and 10% for my back that I have had 3 surgeries on and will need another one within the year. This is crazy!!! I’m rated at 90% rather then 100% and only 10% for my back!!! I can barely walked and stand not able to work anymore but I’m 90% that has taken since 2011 to get this rating!!! We need to fix this!!! ASAP\nFile for your presumptive condition. Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue and IBS. ASAP!\nWe the Veterans love to have a 9/11 post Veteran running this Gigantic Trojan Horse and making sure, he can Taim it well. the Horse has been acting while for many years and is time that our sheriff in town. keeps it well behaved!!\nThis is not true. Collins isn’t be honest. I have several friends that are Veteran Service Officer’s have been FIRED.\nMr. Collins,\nCan you please get rid of the mandate to take the COVID-19 (so called vaccine) and the flu shots as a VA healthcare worker. My family was mandated to take it and now have permanent side effects. This should be a personal decision not mandated by employers, or government agencies.\nNoone is required to take C19 anymore.\nYou are being a lying drama queen. It was never mandated in the first place.\nGood to see a real leader that has been where many of us have been,\nthanks for taking the rein’s Sir\nClearing cases quicker? I had a claim in since 6/2024 to add a dependent and it has been in step 1 of the process for 8 months. I checked the status today and the VA website says I now have no claims. I called the VA and they told me the VA closed the claim. No action taken! The VA rep had no clue as to why they would close it. This is adding a dependent back on. This should not be a difficult request and it certainly shouldn’t take 8 months then have your claim closed with no action taken.\nSame here since July 25, 2024. The claim is stuck in the “claim received “ stage. I’ve emailed AskVA several times and keep getting the same response about they identified a problem in their program and they are working on it as quickly as possible, blah, blah, blah.\nThe VA claims process is a joke at best! As far as firings go, I only have issues with the half illiterate DEI employees behind the office counters. They need to go and be replaced with competent employees who stay off of their personal phones and stop their personal conversations when someone is trying to check in/out, ask a question, etc. There was an incident at the VAMC that I go to where they were behind the sliding glass having story time. A Vet walked up, the girl at the counter turned around, saw him standing there, and then turned back around and continued story time. The Vet slid the glass window open and the girl went off on him in front of everyone. It did not end well for either. She got snatched through the window opening and he was detained by the VA rent-a-cops. I don’t know how much trouble he got into, but hopefully she learned that some Vets are easily triggered and you don’t talk to us like we’re off the streets.\nI’m just happy I can put names to faces.\nWe need a roundtable discussion about national issues related to our service connected disability’s. The VA staff and Doctors are not listening and we need a special exemption for presumption rules that are lacking from the Gulf War 1990/1991 War Zone. We should be treated the same way the OiF /OEF are getting. 1991 War Veterans are not getting the treatments they deserve. We need National Attention on this matter. The law needs to change post 1990 Veterans.\nAs the parent of a veteran who was wounded in battle, not given medical attention and then operated on because he had a growth coming out of the side of his head where he had been impacted and they “couldn’t send him back with that” and then had to wait until 2017 to receive full benefits, I don’t understand. I have within the last 8 months applied for his medical records again from NARA. They referred me to the Army and the Army has not responded to my request to have my son put on a Casualty list and be given the Purple Heart which he bled for. Please let me know who I can contact to get this processed and also get a car which a paraplegic can drive (applied on 3/2024). Also have the home modified, and his benefits listed as 100% service-connected instead of 90% 10% unemployability. This happened in 1/1991. Please help to resolve.\nContact Wounded Warrior Project.\nGood morning Doctor Bonafoux Rivera, I want to express my gratitude and respect for your courage and commitment to help your son. This forum here will not be able to resolve this issue. You may need to contact your local VBA or VHA and work with a patient advocate or a veteran organization like the legion or DVA. If you must you can also reach out to the congressman or senators from your state as they may be able to put assistance on this issue. I wish your son and the family health and strength, please stay focused and do not give up. The nation and all other veterans are with you.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nMr. Secretary, Pres.Trump & etc..Its hard to believe the the VA in not recognizing BURN PITS in Vietnam.\nThey were used eveyday in all base camps. Stiring everything they could burn in these pits, by our hands\nusing wooden poles and no mask or breathing , no eye protection, no hearing protection, no protective clothing you name it.\nAll done by the lowest ranking personnel.\nSo the VN vets file claims for Asthma, skin cancers and etc… all denied !\nSo what else can they do to us?\nThis is where the military got its ideas to use them again in the Middle East.\nBut they recognize this damage to the soliders there, not Nam.\nSo please fix it! Correct the failures of last aministrations who have failed us.\nSecretary Collins and Presdient Trump administration\nThank you\nThe DOD has long maintained that there never was any Agent Orange on Okinawa. This is a lie. It was used to clear foliage along the Kadena AFB perimeter fence. In 1971 the DOD (under pressure from the Japanese Government) conducted “Operation Red Hat” where all poisonous gases and defoliants were transferred to Johnston Atoll aboard naval ships. Those sailors involved are eligible for Agent Orange treatment and compensation. Those Okinawan Marines who loaded these chemicals onto deuce and halvess and delivered them to the dock are not! I developed high level and profuse prostate cancer (classic result of Agent Orange exposure). It had to be removed. The VA wouldn’t cover it because “there was never any Agent Orange on Okinawa. I can deliver proof that there was. In fact, years later there were many barrels of AO found buried at Camp Foster where l was assugned.\nUnder Biden the pact act was passed to help veterans that was impacted from burn pits get your story right\nNot Vietnam burn pits sparky\nThe VA claims that the benefits are improving and the care is improving. When I needed a x-ray on my neck it took 3 months to get a order and by then I already had a ct scan at the hospital which the care wasn’t any better. I ended up going to Vanderbilt emergency surgery to remove a tumor off my spine. VA or any civilian care around where I live is hopeless.\nWhen you deal with bad PLs that do not change, it takes a good staff around the Sec of VA to show executive options. Not rely on Congress to do all the work. The Sec literally has similar powers as a President. So CFR 38 ss 3.317 does not service connect because of the UDX aspect they could fix that. Gulf war is tied to closely to Undiagnosed Illness, VA countered this by making everything diagnosed even if its wrong.\nSo it fails at 93% rejection rate which VA loves. All wars should be service connected by time, date, and location. Which they have begun to do with OIF / OEF under the PACT act. Only to find the PACT act exclusionary to 1991 Gulf War vets. it sometimes can literally be the title of the section of CFR 38 that hinders a rating and the ICD codes. Something I tried to fix on a VA federal advisory committee that VA blew off. I did the l same with the PACT act in 2021 when I said in the news media it had loopholes, and by September came the flood of zero ratings. The best most can do is 30% between gulf war and OIF, OEF – zero rating is often the end result. Its not fair.\n————————————————————-\nThere isnt enough room and they only allow 5,000 words here. So you will find the bulk of my remarks on the VA Facebook post of this article. Im a 28 year advocate, Disabled combat veteran, and served of a VA federal advisory committee – ACGWV in 2009. In 2003 I was world famous for opposing the deployment of troops to Iraq. Last 3 years Ive pummeled this public comments portion of New.va.gov over VA RAC meetings, and found VA ignores these public comment portions.\nIm a subject matter expert with a lot to offer. Im also a historian having participated in our plight since 1997. So Ive learned one thing about VA, unless your part of the wealthy in the executive branch – then they dont care. Ive looked out the Sec of VAs window long ago, and this is my 14th Sec of VA to deal with. As long as Im a poor disabled veteran, Im not worthy of there time. It didnt use to be this way.\nClearing cases faster? Over a year ago, l filed a 511 claim. It took a year to clear when the average clearance time was 14 months. My claim was rejected due to “not service connected”! 511 claims are for injuries sustained in VA hospitals. There is never a service connection in 511 claims!\nI’m fighting an 1151 claim going on 10 years. They are always denied. Then you go into the never ending appeals process. Get help from DAV or another VSO or organization. And keep an eye on them because some of them aren’t competent either.\nVA’s answer to my questions is to block my cell phone internet access to va.gov\nwhich says volumes. Sec of VA Doug Collins signed off on that for it to happen.\nHe has no intentions of helping anyone in my income bracket.\nPretty sure we have another coward Sec of VA that doesnt face veterans unless\nhe benefits from it some how. As Ive only written 4 emails and asked simple\nquestions. I think the biggest reason they are dodging me is I found there maybe\na 1 in 5 rate of ALS in those that served the last 34 years. At minimum 1 in 10.\nWell, Ive got my answer then. Snob Sec of VA. Religious zealot with a superiority\ncomplex. He is one of the chosen, and I am not. Seen enough of these. Its gods will\nmy life has been like this, and some of us are just unlucky. He only has time for\nhis fellow followers, believers, and the rest of us are wrong.\nGoing to be a very bad year for us veterans. Till folks catch on.\nI have been assigned a new VA clinic that recently opened. I have a new Doctor. How is the order to fire all new federal employees going to affect my new clinic and my Doctor? I have been exposed to Agent Orange and currently have a mass in my lung and also in my throat. I am scheduled for surgery in May, is that still going to happen? I put in a claim for my agent orange exposure, is that still going to be processed? When you say your clearing cases faster than ever, is that because your just saying NO quickly? What percentage of claims are you denying? The scuttlebutt is that all new claims will be denied. This stuff is giving me a lot of anxiety.\nThank you Mr. Collins. Not to shabby for your first week!\nAs a Government employee for 40 years (NAVY-VA combined), I see there is nothing easy or quick about applying for benefits. I have given up on reopening claims. I can relate to some of these comments.\nKeep the faith!\nMadam Collins,\nThank you for denying these allegations and simply telling us lies. The truth would be unbearable and make the administration look bad. Please refrain from telling the truth if it makes you look bad. Continue to lie to us and we will believe you as long as your lies are what we want to hear.\nMadam Collins? What are you, 10 yrs old. Grow up and act like a Veteran who served Honorably, but my guess is that you probably didn’t.\nHe’s probably from ME and has been writing to Susan Collins. Cut and paste. Your reply indicates more about your own values than his. You should be ashamed not him or her.\nYou know darn well he meant Secretary of VA Collins. You should be ashamed that your momma gave birth to you.\nHello Mr. Collins. If you want to see what is really going on in the VA that are supposed to be knowledgeable veteran raters, please sir contact me and I will give you the details to look at my case. I have called my congressman, called my senator, call the complaint line twice and my claim is a hardship claim, Going on eleven months and been to 16 C&P exams. I have done everything that I can think of. I know this comment won’t reach your eyes but you have staff that hates veterans. The more they can give you the run around and not rate your claim, the better the must feel about themselves. The VA is violating their own regulations and I will be happy to provide rules they set about medical evidence and exams. Everytime I complain too loud, they has VES set me up more appointments. Then they lie to you when you can see your file and have screen shots to prove they are not being honest. USMC 3/1972 – 11/1974\nDOGE has absolutely NO authority to access veteran’s personal information. It is NOT a legitimate organization and therefore needs to be blocked.\nI personally trust a multi Billionaire, more than the past dozen supposed leaders, we all need to face it our info is already out there , as many time as we have had medical record swappers, the streamlining of our services, out info has been jeopardized decades ago, let them find and let us all know what our tax dollars have been blown away on, when we had people in charge who didn’t even know which gender they are you were seriously comprised,\nHave faith in the powers that now be.\nI have to admit, there is a lot of truth to what this person is saying. The mega men and women in Congress and the Senate have violated their oath to the constitution. They have turned their backs on democracy and have supported a traitor, a felon and a hollow man, and just like him they have no moral compass, no values and no character.\nHistory will be especially hard on these people, and any veteran who has his sense of self will be willing to go through the last full measure to ensure that these people never rise to the top.\nspoken like am intelligent person. Good on you. too many here speak without knowing truth.\nWhy on earth would you trust a billionaire that fired the people who were investigating his companies within the first month of being placed in a position? Musk is literally only here for the money that he will earn. He does not care for us nor for any Democracy, hence why he was supporting the far-right parties of European countries.\nWhy would you trust a billionaire who is firing thousands of people so he can save more money on his taxes? Why would you trust a man who is destroying NASA so he can get his personal company more contracts from the government? Think about it for a moment, please. You don’t become a multi-billionaire without deciding money is the most important thing in your entire life, and he is going to sell us all down the river so he can become the world’s first trillionaire.\nI pray that you are not serious. People do not become billionaires because they are honest or trustworthy. If you are willing to toss away your constitutional rights to privacy, that is your choice. Real Americans are not built that way.\nFaith is believing what you know ain’t true. – Mark Twain\nI am posting to question your comment that no benefits are being cut back. I am an 80 year old 100% service connected total and permanent disabled Viet Nam veteran. I am homebound and unable to effectively perform most of the normal activities of daily life. For most of 2024 the VA Community Care Team in Dallas Texas awarded me 58 hours a week of Home Healthcare Aid. This allowed me to enjoy a healthy lifestyle and my quality of life was very good. In August of 2024 my weekly hours were reduced to 11 hours a week and after an appeal this was increased to 13 hours a week. When the time for review and renewal for this benefit arrived in 2025 I was again awarded 13 hours. Any reasonable person can do the math and see thar 13 hours for a 7 day week equals 1.8 hours/day. As most providers require a minimum of 4 hours/day this leaves me with help for three days out of a seven day week. On many occasions when I contacted the VA about this benefit I was told that all of the veterans in this area were being cut back. No reason was given.\nThe VA needs more people, not less. It took me 1 year to get a specialist approval in the Community Care system. They don’t have enough nurses to approve cases. It’s good my issue wasn’t life threatening. Also, cuts to benefits, including disability compensation have been proposed in Project 2025, the conservative playbook that the administration appears to be following.\nDear President Trump,\nI am writing to make you aware of an injustice that has been done to veterans across the country, I left active duty in 1994 after serving 11 years as an active-duty Army officer. I was offered a bonus of $61,201.91 based on time served and my rank. Congress authorized DoD to offer these bonuses so the military could reach Congressionally-mandated force levels without involuntarily dismissals.\nThat bonus, $61,201.91, was taxed by the Internal Revenue Service by 28% ($17,136.53.), leaving my net bonus $44,065.38 which I received May 31, 1994 and my family and I used to put money down on a home and to bridge the gap between the security of a military career and the insecurity of beginning another career, which was the purpose of the bonus.\nWithin a month of leaving the Army, I received a letter from the VA stating that I was authorized 10 percent disability payments of VA Disability Compensation, $87.00 monthly at the time. The same letter told me that I would not receive that amount because I had received a separation bonus and that they would recoup my VADC until they had recouped my bonus amount. 21 years later, in 2015, the VA let me know that they had recouped the net amount of my bonus, $44,065.38 and I started receiving VADC.\nI also continued my military career in the Army Reserve – ultimately qualifying for reserve component retirement which began for me at age 60 (February 15, 2021). The Defense Finance and Accounting Service told me that they were also required to also recoup my 1994 separation bonus, less what the VA recouped.\nDFAS, however made it clear that the law allowed them to recoup the “pre-tax amount,” less what the VA recouped. So DFAS told me that the balance I owed to them was $17,136.53; that’s precisely the amount the IRS withheld in 1994.\nThe first problem is that the law doesn’t really say what DFAS says it says. DFAS interprets the law to benefit the bureaucracy. The language in the law is NOT clear, but instead of giving the benefit of the doubt to the Soldier, they give the benefit of the doubt to the government. The second problem is that DFAS cites laws, rules and policy and they claim that they have no choice but to follow the “rules” but they do not follow the same rules and policies when it requires them to do certain things.\nEssentially, Congress, DoD, DFAS, and the VA played a massive decades-long shell game to move and shift money. Congress gave DoD the money to complete that post-Cold War, 1990s drawdown with the minimum amount of financial pain to the service-person. DoD and the VA then figured out ways to get that money back and use it for other purposes.\nMy bonus has been taxed three times – once in 1994 by 28% ($17,136.53.) a second time by the VA by $44,065.38 and again in 2021 by 28% ($17,136.53) by DFAS. I’ve had to pay back to the government $78,338.44 for a bonus of $61,201.91.\nThat’s a tax rate of 125 percent. DOGE needs to look into this\nI am seeking help on this, not so much for myself, but for other veterans who are in difficult financial situations and who could truly benefit.\nHere is an online petition with more comments\nhttps://www.ipetitions.com/petition/va-recoupment-of-disable-veterans-ssbvsi-payments\nA military retirement represents much more than the dollar figure involved; it represents an acknowledgement of the sacrifice made by the Serviceperson, their family and loved ones. It represents the covenant that Soldiers, Airmen, Marines, and Sailors underwrite, endorse and embrace as free citizens of a great nation. We sign that covenant with our own blood and with the blood of our families who sacrifice in ways that are inexplicable to those unfamiliar with military service. Bureaucratic rules and processes such as the ones I described diminish in tangible and palpable ways the reciprocal feelings of goodwill, devotion, and affection that servicepeople should feel toward their Nation\nIt seems that programs like the Veterans Transportation Network would be prime targets of Musk and the Muskrats.\nVeterans with 100per cent disability get free dental care at VA. Why can’t veterans with 90 per cent disability disability be given the same preference? Can one of our representatives in Washington proposes putting forward a bill before Congress to make this a law.? Many veterans cannot afford private insurance.\nMy husband died because it took a month or longer to set him up with doctors and approve them! After he died VA denied an ambulance bill of $5,000 just because of a 72 hour rule I had never heard of! When my husband was dying and needed an ambulance do you think I would think to contact you? I informed the ambulance service that he was a veteran they should have done something! Another Joe Biden/Kamala Harris F up! That last hospital visit I was finally told after a few trips there and they claimed flu and pneumonia; was actually the last stages of cancer in his lungs and mastesized through his esophagus and other areas and had gone to his liver and kidneys! VA NEEDS a complete overhaul of doctors, administrators and all! It has gone to crap!!!!\nThis crap is Biden Harris doing’s!!!!\nFile a TORT CLAIM. You are right the hospital is supposed to contact the VA. If I’m dying how can I call the VA? I can’t!\nI’m so sorry about your husband! The VA IS totally screwed up but it always has been. I’ve had my own issues with ambulance payments, incorrect diagnoses- repeatedly for different issues and was never as happy as when I aged into Medicare and could avoid the VA most of the time! That said, this has nothing to do with who is President. The VA does it’s own thing under the VA Sec and we have had a whole lot of losers over the last 20 years and before that. And the VA Sec is restrained by the amount of money allocated by Congress. Don’t blame Biden/Harris. They inherited the VA from the past 100+years and they only had a Democratic Congress for 2 years to try and make changes. They did allocate a lot of new money for a lot of programs including the VA. The last 2 years the GOP got nothing done. And now Trump is rolling back all that money, those programs, and making deep cuts of funds and personnel. This post by Sec Collins is a bunch of BS. You wait and see.\nI too, have a Biden/Harris story. I am now a widow. The VA’s failings began long before Trump and Musk. The VA and the DOJ (grant programs)both waste serious money.\nTrump and his administration is pro service member. I have every confidence they will honor the commitment to our veterans. I am a veteran and I am a former VA employee. There are thousands like me who will stand up to anyone who tries to undo the sacred services for our fellow veterans.\nWe know there is stuff that needs to be cut and procurement regulations improved. Perhaps even high paid upper management could need trimming but I hope they retain all the dedicated staff that is high performing and needed and cut only those who aren’t.\nI welcome this opportunity to reevaluate government that so many administrations have failed to do in the past. Let this process play out.\nIt amazes me that you, as a veteran who pledged allegiance to the Constitution, pledge fealty to an unelected billionaire sociopath and sitting, draft-dodging, puppet “president”. All this, despite the literal acts of treason on Jan 6th. The ability to be so committed and vested in sociopaths who do NOT have your best interest in mind and are solely motivated to make themselves richer and more powerful at the American people’s expense is baffling to me.\nMaking the government more efficient and eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse is a fantastic goal.\nWhat this administration is doing is NOT that and if you choose to actually evaluate their actions and consequences, maybe you will understand what is happening to our country.\nNo facts. That is what you offered. You would rather have Biden? Obama? Maybe Clinton. Fraud, waste and abuse must stop. You and I paid for others to defraud the United States and to fund terrorists. So, “and if you choose to actually evaluate their” (Dems) actions and consequences, maybe ytou will understand what is happening to our country”. Surely you do not believe that our country was better with 4 years of previous administration?\nJan of 2024 Biden signed an executive order that authorized the 24/7 surveillance of all American Citizens. That is actually called the most treasonous act of any American president in history. Just saying.\nYou are not a Patriot, this is an untruth at best and more likely a lie. It wasn’t an executive order, it was an extension of the previous bill after it was re-authorized by Congress. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is crucial in disrupting terrorist attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. It does NOT surveil ALL US citizens 24/7. I assume you have a reason to be concerned? I don’t.\nPlease do your research before posting incorrect information. In April 2024 President Biden signed a BILL that had bipartisan support (60-34 vote in Senate) EXTENDING a key US surveillance program (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) that was first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since. It targets non-Americans in other countries and communications of Americans in contact with those targeted foreigners. Google it for more truthfuland educational information.\nYes, would prefer any of them over a draft dodging convicted felon.\nAnybody spouting opposition to what Trump and DOGE are doing is simply uninformed. We could not have a better, more supportive leader for this nation and our military and veterans.\nMazel Tov Secretary Doug Collins! Is there a way that us senior Veterans receiving their medications (Not narcotics) can be automatically sent without having to remember to reorder them every month or every other month? Online, mail, phone call to pharmacy, message to the primary physician is sometimes diffucult to remember and sometimes confusing?\nAsk if you can get 90 day supply and If you have an online account, when you receive your medicine go online and check the box to order a refill. According to a technician in the in hospital pharmacy, when the refill is due, it will be mailed out automatically.\nSecVA Anthony J. Principi addressed waste in a 2005 op-ed for WaPo.\nHe outlined changes that could save the government 125 billion dollars without harming veteran quality of care.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/va-isnt-broken-but-its-in-desperate-need-of-change/2018/04/10/54cb1c0c-3c0a-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0_story.html\nSo the news media is making all of this story up out of whole cloth?\n“This executive order seeks to impose severe hiring restrictions and would disproportionately harm veterans, who make up one-third of the federal workforce. Requiring agencies to hire only one new employee for every four who leave will drastically reduce VA staffing levels. At a time when the veteran population is aging and the VA’s mission has expanded under Biden, this policy will lead to massive delays and outright denials in health care, benefits processing, and disability claims – the essential services veterans depend on to survive.”\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-and-musk-are-going-to-war-against-military-veterans/ar-AA1yZkRm\nYou obviously have not read the actual order. You must be listening to MSN’s version of the facts, which are very tainted (to Left Wing propaganda). Do not be a sheep. President Trump is doing the right things, and I see nothing that DOGE is doing that will impact veterans negatively. Quite the opposite. Waste and abuse are being eliminated, money will be going where it should be now.\nDear Honorable Secretary Collins,\nCongratulations on your new assignment as the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I am elated that you have encouraged veterans to come and see you for the truth of what is going on. In addition your promise to ensure and protect the VA from cuts with your heart and the God that you serve. According to the weekly report there are 953,078 pending VA disability claims as of February 8, 2025, and a Back Log of 254,679 claims. What is the plan to insure that there will be enough employees to continue adjuicating these claims, if many of the government employees opt out and leave Veterans Affairs or are fired? Hiring is not just a come to work, it is a long process to learn how to adjuicate claims.\nRespectfully,\nRochelle Crump,\nFormer VA Regional Office Employee, 23 years Government Service\nUnited States Womens Army Corps (WAC) Vietnam Era\nLet’s make sure that these said employees doing claims are even qualified to do so. I did a claim back in 2022 and then shortly after my claim came back with more red tape to slash, a newsletter came out from the VA stating that the personnel they had doing claims were not qualified to do them. You can find a lot of information about VA subject matter at the GAO website. Government Accountability Office.\nThank you for your service and this letter! 10 years and waiting.\nWhat’s Doug Collins’ email address?\nGreat to hear from you so candidly Honorable Collins! As a VA Nurse and a surviving Navy and Army Veteran spouse, I have some concerns and an initiative to share regarding a service members eligibility for state VA nursing home care. I would like to share some thoughts with you and or your staff. Please advise. Thank you for your service then and now!\nThank God and my Savior Jesus Christ for President Trump and Secretary Collins for their love and dedication to America and those who have and continue to serve Her and protect Her!\nCongratulations secretary Collins. You are a patriot and I know the VA will be in very capable hands under your leadership.\nI read yesterday that they may target veterans with service connected disability who also draw social security. That sounds about right for this crime family.\nCan you post the source you read this from?\nThank you Secretary Collins I hope to see you in person when you visit the Phoenix VA. Be safe and God Bless!\nMr. Collins,\nI would like to speak to you about the years of horrible healthcare I have received from the VA. This has included waiting three years and writing three different Georgia Senators to try to get help. Furthermore, I have lost coverage for six months numerous times and no one can tell me why. Please contact me at the email below to hear more. I also have an easy way to make VA Healthcare a lot better for Veterans.\nThank You Secretary Collins !!! I feel better every day now. God Bless you.\nhttps://veteranspolicy.org/post/project-2025s-war-on-veterans/\nProject 2025 plans to dismantle the VA. Read the article wake up. They are coming for veterans as well.\nMr Collins,\nI myself will hold your feet to the fire about our personal information, health records, treatments not being invaded by a non approved group(DOGE). Further, any cuts or changes to the VA benefits by the Project 2025 will fall on you! Any services that are taken away from Veterans is a complete insult by your boss! Keep your word as you would in deed!\nI don’t believe a word any of them say. There is no reason an illegal immigrate tech billionaire with no military service and multiple failed enterprises should be poking around the VA much less any part of the government.\nyou have never done anything and it Didn’t go the way you wanted?,\nDon’t believe it. He is shaking hands with the devil while telling his living in hell is the better than heaven.\nMy dependents request has been sitting there untouched since August. It would be nice if someone would at least open the file and respond with in process or something.\nI had the same problem with CHAMPVA- I opened a congressional inquiry\nCan’t believe what they say, my husband passed a decorated Nam vet. 6yuears ago, they said he had cancer spots, we ask can you do a biopsy? Doc said ahh, don’t worry it’s not growing it’s very small. An aggressive cancer seven months later he passed. There’s the supposed compensation for this type of cancer, and for the burning of pits in Nam,, to late now, I can’t claim nothing, So they say. They were negligent\nSorry for your loss.\nIts hard to believe the the VA in not recognizing BURN PITS in Vietnam.\nThis is where the military gone its ideas to use them again in the Middle East.\nBut they recognize this damage to the soliders there, not Nam.\nSo please fix it! Correct the failures of last aministrations who have failed us.\nSecretary Collins and Presdient Trump administration\nFile a TORT claim for negligence.\nSecretary Mr Collins.\nMy Issue is Burn Pits!\nIn Vietnam Burn pits were almaost a everyday issue in all base camps using wooden poles.\nWe using gasoline and diesel and keep stiring it by hand, burning it down as much as possible.\nWhat went in them was everything you can amagine, for 10years.\nThis was always done by low ranking personnel.\nNo breathing appliance, no earing protection, no body protection except your clothes you have on.\nSo If you think about it, that’s where the Middle East wars got the idea.\nSo, please help stop some of this dissreguard for the Vietnam Veterans.\nIn 1991 we were all told the VN war was started on a Lie, we were not attacked by North Vietnam.\nWOW how did we all feel after that? How did we feel coming home where we were hated in a lot\nof places.\nJust look into an See.\nFrom the looks of some of the comments, they need to file a claim for TDS from Service connected injuries sustained by watching Fake News. Seek some help and get your 100% for Psychosis.\nYou’re acting like a child. Grow up\nAmen!! Very refreshing Sir.\nAmen brother. What a bunch of sea lawyers on here.\nThanks for the update Doug! We know you have our back and of course prepare for all the left’s Fear-Mongering. That’s all they have left and yes the gravy train is over.\nHay just went to VA at Hines in ILLINOIS I need surgery on left knee, I am 100% disabled Vietnam Veteran Marine, they said I will have to wait four months for a appointment, that is bad I need help,\nFrank Lasick Jr\nIf you don’t have Medicare or Medicaid from your State I’d highly recommend looking into it. I have always received much better health care from Medicare than the VA.\nIt’s been 16 months waiting for a dependent, my wife to. be put on my va benefits. We call the local va office in our location and they tell us it is still open\nWhy is it taking so long?\nCongrats VA Secretary Collin’s, this I will say ..say what you mean & mean what you say…personally don’t have any faith in DOGE…but now seeing is believing…Pentagon is next in line\nWOW! Congratulations Doug Collins & Thank You President Trump for realizing the Competence & Quality of this Patriotic Man from Georgia! Doug ~ I am a United States Marine Corps Veteran having served in Camp Lejeune North Carolina wherein I endured, proudly I might add, “Advanced Combat Infantry Training” > The Camp Lejeune Justice Act is intended to help Marines like myself having had to drink contaminated water ~ every hour~ every day ~ that I was stationed there in 1963 AD. I am a survivor of Colon Cancer ~ Prostate Cancer ~ Kidney Disease ~ COPD and many more illnesses. GOD has been Watching Over Me as I recently turned 90 years of age. I have participated in Monthly Zoom Webinars conducted by my Attorneys’ Wallace & Graham,Salisbury NC since I became their Client representing me in 2021AD. As of this writing very few settlements { 8%} have OCCURRED UNDER the PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. Call Me Doug when you get a chance Bob Higgins Semper Fi\nSo happy that you are the Veteran’s Secretary! Our Veterans are in good hands! Thank you Doug Collin’s and by the way, my cousin, Jim Miller, is your doppelgänger. He is a retired Texas Ranger and he not only looks just like you, he talks just like you! It is uncanny! Hope all goes well with your new position and I know you will help our Veterans fairly and improve on Veteran’s care. Charlotte Naizer. Belton, Texas\nI don’t believe anything this administration Elon, Trump or VA director say. If their lips are moving their lying.\n100 percent agree. Project 2025 talks about dismantling the VA as well. This man is just giving us lip service.\nAmen to that!\nVa and the so called benefits is bs. First I was turned down for not serving 2 years when I was just short. And now vso supposedly put in claim for me but va never received it. Lies and corruption is all it is. Vets don’t get anything. You put your life on the line so ungrateful -ss people can deny you. Then you now see why vets kill them self or blow sh-t up or just run ungrateful -ss people down. Maybe you people should give vets the positions to help vet\nNot crooked -ss politicians who just pad their pockets and screw vets\nMaybe do some research. Don’t speak for those who actually served and actually defended this country by risking our lives. You said “maybe you people should give vets the positions and help vets”.. Glad you said that because Doug Collins is in the Air Force. haha.\nNo way these comments are coming from vets. The only whiny vets I’ve heard from was from the air force\nHey buddie, I’m not whining and I am AIR FORCE\nI’m a vet and nothing but hopeful and positive feeling of the way I hope things will be, think about another 4 years of what we just had.\nCongratulations your Honorable Doug Collins I have been an admirer of you for years and know the VA is going to be enhanced with your expertise. Your Honor I do not know the staff member to send my letter to so I am sending it to you. Thank you for your past service and from here on there is no past just a future of service. We look forward to the future success you will have in the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nthis man sounds sincere.i am hoping he will do a good job..\nI am employee at a VA Hosp in California and my democrat colleagues can be disruptive to my workflow, making efficiency even worse. They cannot move on from the election result. I just want going to work and do my job. Leadership seems to tolerate since they probably have the same politics. Also, our local workers union is fear-mongering and misaligning your messages.\nI have Coumity Care and when my doctor request blood work i have to go to a private provider where the VA has a facility very close to my doctor and has a lab but will not accept me but they pay the private company $800 to do blood work\nTY Dec Collins! As a VA Hosp employee, I can say we really use some efficiency, restructuring and less woke culture.\nI agree! VA Nurse too.\nGood morning,\nIt would be nice if there was a way for us VA employees to make suggestions on ways to cut down on unnecessary procedures and wastefulness and see it followed through.\nLess woke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with woke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nLess woke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with woke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nAh, so just go get screwed to the women, black, LGBTQ, and other minority Vets that served then? If you are truly a VA Nurse, you need to get fired for not taking care of ALL of your Veterans. Woke means positive change and moving forward. Do you really want to go back into the past? Silly questions…of course, you and others like you want to. Leaning into hate is just…well, hateful and disgusting.\nCan we please get dental care for veterans using VA health care any medical problems can occur due to bad dental issues would be nice if we could use community care in my veterans get dental care as well as medical care!\nIf you go to your PCP and ask for a referral to dental due to health issues, the VA has to honor it and then dental becomes a health issue. Also check your DD214 and see if block 17 is checked yes or no. This has to do with a final dental exam upon discharge. If it is checked NO then the VA has to pick up any dental that was done in the service.\nI Coumity Care and TriWest should issue an insurance card to provider the medical staff on contact billing info\nHe doesn’t even consider us female veterans, as veterans. He’s lying because he’s a Trump loyalist in the cult. He’s one of the ones trying to tax our disability compensation.\nATTN: Dept of Veterans Affairs\n5 yrs ago I wrote to you\nNothing new here, getting fuked again by the VA I will be filing a Federal Lawsuit Against the VA for FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FAILURE TO PAY LEGAL LAWFUL BILLS DUE AND OWING TO CIVILIAN HOSPITALS, Doctors, Nurses, Technicians, Rescue Squads, ie. The Choice Program and For Ruining my FICO SCORES and CREDIT REPUTATION due to Collection Agencies and their Harrassment. ALONG WITH THE VA, I will also name Congressman Tom O’Halleran CD 1 AZ and his Veteran Representative in Casa Grande, AZ , for not acting for over 2 years on this issue as well as individuals in the Miami VA Hospital System, Lake City Florida VA Hospital System and Tucson VA Medical Center. Lawyer up folks ’cause the paperwork is being filed.\nI want to thank the Dept of Veterans Affairs for making me HOMELESS AGAIN…After deducting more than $800 USD from my unemployable Benefit, Due to Severe Hypertension and Heart attack/Stroke risk, of which I had a STROKE this past year, they do not give a sh-t that a Veteran is HOMELESS…\nI will probably be dead before the Dept of Veterans Affairs answers any questions that I have had regarding taking over $800 from my VA Benefits…\n<<<<< Do you see the avatar of me, I am 72 years old, plagued with severe HYPERTENSION, Covid, Bacterial Pneumonia, STROKE, and Dengue this past year, I was eligible for Unemployable benefits from the Veterans Administration, this month The VA slashed over $800USD from my benefit because of Social Security that I receive…Can someone explain to me how the VA can do this? Can anyone help me?\nContact me, Thanx…\nCarlo Mathiesen\nDecember 12, 2024\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\nSt Petersburg, FL\nSubject: NEXUS Letter to Support Continued Disability Benefit Amount\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing this letter to support my request to maintain my previously approved unemployable disability benefit amount. I am a veteran and I have been experiencing multiple service-connected conditions that have significantly impaired my overall quality of life and ability to function.\nI currently suffer from the following which were not included in previous medical examinations, conditions:\n1. Tinnitus\n2. Anxiety and Depression\n3. Migraine Headaches, which cause severe symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously\n4. Shortness of Breath, a side effect of the medications prescribed by VA healthcare providers\nEach of these medical conditions has been well-documented by VA medical personnel and various specialists over the years. I have been under continuous treatment and care at the Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, and I am currently prescribed multiple medications to manage these symptoms. Unfortunately, these medications have introduced new complications, such as shortness of breath, which I attribute directly to the prescribed treatments.\nMy migraine headaches, which result in intense vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously, have significantly reduced my ability to engage in day-to-day activities and have made it difficult for me to maintain a stable routine. Additionally, my anxiety and depression continue to exacerbate these challenges, compounding my overall mental and physical health struggles.\nDue to these service-connected conditions, my ability to maintain consistent employment or perform routine tasks has been substantially impaired. I kindly request that the Department of Veterans Affairs reconsider and approve my continued disability benefit amount, as I rely on these benefits to manage ongoing healthcare costs, treatment, and support services.\nMy situation highlights the direct correlation between my connected disabilities and the challenges I face. Continued support will allow me access to critical medical care and ongoing treatment from VA healthcare providers who are familiar with my health history and specific needs.\nI am available to provide any additional medical documentation, treatment records, or statements from healthcare professionals who have treated me through the VA system. Please do not hesitate to contact me\nThank you very much for your time and consideration. I sincerely appreciate your support in ensuring that I continue to receive the benefits that are crucial to my ongoing treatment and well-being.\nSincerely,\nCarlo Mathiesen\nHe doesn’t even consider us female veterans, as veterans. He’s lying because he’s a Trump loyalist in the cult.\nwhy would u even say that?\nBecause it’s true. He’s part of the J6 insurrection and could care less about veterans. People need to wake up and pay attention\nBecause she is correct….\nI have a honorable discharge from the army reserve and I have been trying to get help with my veterans assistance in Meridian Ms and not to forget to mention I have disabilities while serving into the army reserve due to the fact that I was transferred to the regular army bases for my terms . I have have filed a timely claim for my benefits and compensation. But I believe archive lost all my DD214 during all my tours . It’s been 2 years old and I just been forgot about because during a peaceful term. Please let me know my status of the complaint I filed.\npissed off disabled veteran cant even post her name. thats why she can comfortably say crap. I am also a female vet. I get what I need; not more than I need. I hope all vets get what they need, not what they want.

He’s a puppet of the guy who called our fallen military “suckers and losers.” A puppet of the guy who told his entourage that disfigured military veterans should not be part of veteran ceremonies. The puppetmaster has already hit the understaffed VA by firing a bunch of employees and ending contracts.

We serve, retired, got injured while serving, earned VA benefits for those injuries, paid into SS for our entire lives. It’s hard to believe that anyone would even consider looking into cutting benefits for any of us. We have paid for these benefits in ways that are not imaginable to someone that hasnt served. Take away benefits when I turn 67 seriously? I paid for one my entire life and earned the other risking my life for this country.\nDamn.. page not found. They took the budget down. Hopefully someone copied it.\nSir,\nIs DOGE, vetted?, how many actual Veterans in DOGE, if zero, they should hit the f*cking door because penny counters don’t know the journey.\nAlso could you put up photos and qualifications of the DOGE inspectors.Let be leaders by doing what is promised “transparency” and not generic statements like “hitting the ground running” when we all know the clear destination of your running matters.\nThank you for asking these very important questions!! I fear dependent Chapter 35 benefits are on the table, too.\nThis is all just messaging, not factual information. Why don’t you answer the following, Dougie:\n1. Do you support means-testing for eligibility for VA disability compensation, as outlined in the report at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60915?\n2. Do you support ending VA’s Individual Unemployability Payments to Disabled Veterans at the Full Retirement Age for Social Security as found in the report at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60916?\n3. Do you support VA’s Disability Payments being included as Taxable Income, as found at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60947?\n4. What planned changes are you advocating for on the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities that affects our disability payments, as laid out in Project 2025 that says you want to partially cut benefits for Veterans? (See https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf)\nVeterans…do not be fooled by these talking points. He wants to cut facilities and your benefits. Contact your Congressional members now to tell him cuts are a non-starter.\nExactly. So many Vets are convinced their benefits won’t be touched. Are they ok if their dependents lose Chapter 35?\nIs it possible for veterans who have retired from the military use other pharmacies than Walgreens,CVS, Walmart or Publix because they are not in the Veteran’s best interest. When I was able to use my family pharmacy never had any problems getting my medicine. The pharmacies listed above do not care about the veterans at all.\nGet up off your knees and raise your head. Praising a dictator is not in the job description of a VA Secretary. We’ve heard too many lies from the “king“ and his serfs. It’s not what you say, it’s what you do. We’ll be watching.\nRelevant and important information. Thanks for asking and addressing this propagandist BS\nWhat a bunch of malarkey. We’ve been lied to by this whole administration. We wanted a better economy, not this dog and pony show of renaming bodies of water and stopping benefits from other people. Every cabinet member lied bold faced to Congress, so I don’t think this secretary is any different. He’s a big fan of contracting out medical care to the public sector, which is not equipped to take on the entire veteran population. I don’t doubt he won’t start chopping out the low performing employees, but he sure won’t replace them either. You like waiting 8 months for a dependency claim? Try 2 years after they get done firing everyone. Want hour long wait time for a phone call where you get to talk to a heavy accent foreigner? Or a robot? This Secretary will be the one to do it.\nCall your Members of Congress and hold this guy’s feet to the fire.\nNotice how he first addressed the media and not veteran’s concerns? This is a fascist move…..I don’t believe a word out of this man’s mouth.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

As Trump put it in November, right now “free trade’s no good” for the United States.\nIt may sound strange for the leading GOP candidate for president to be bad-mouthing free trade, but this is a protectionist sentiment that more and more Republicans appear to be warming up to.\nIt’s also a protectionist sentiment that’s drawn from the party’s paranoid past, as I’ve explored in my new book on Anglo-American trade.\n‘Designed for China’\nTrump considers the TPP “a horrible deal … designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.” He thus conspiratorially sees a China-backed plot hidden behind the TPP, despite the fact that China is not actually involved in the TPP – nor is there really any back door.\nTrump similarly considers NAFTA “a disaster,” and claims that he would either renegotiate it or “break it. Because, you know, every agreement has an end.” He proposes to replace NAFTA with a protective tariff directed against Mexican exports, a policy that would very likely result in a tariff war with the US’ third-largest trading partner.\nTrump’s condemnation of free-trade initiatives and his conspiracy theories regarding Chinese-American trade are being treated as unorthodox. But they shouldn’t be.\nGranted, at first glance his protectionist position appears at odds with the Republican Party’s current association with trade liberalization initiatives like the WTO, NAFTA and the TPP.\nBut connecting free trade with the Republican Party is, to put it mildly, very misleading. It is also a very recent phenomenon.\nFree trade conspiracies\nAs my research on the history of US trade shows, the longer story of the Republican Party’s economic ideology illuminates how Trump’s protectionism and free trade conspiracy theories actually are quite in keeping with that of the GOP majority throughout most of its century-and-a-half lifespan.\nIt is well-known that the Republican Party was the party of antislavery when it was founded in the mid-19th century. Less well-known is that the fledgling party also wedded itself politically and ideologically to protectionism, dedicating itself early on to insulating American infant industries from the full force of global market competition, particularly from the more industrially advanced British.\nWith the end of the U.S. Civil War in 1865 and black emancipation, the Republican Party’s antislavery impulse waned. As a result, the party turned ever more to its ideological dedication to economic nationalism, advocating for greater American protectionism even as it turned away from defending the civil rights of African Americans.\nThe Republican Party dominated the executive branch for nearly 75 years – from the 1860s to the early 1930s. Across this period they established and expanded their economic nationalist vision for the United States, implementing highly protectionist legislation in 1861, 1883, 1890, 1897, 1909, 1922 and 1930. During these decades and beyond, the Republican Party time and again stood in opposition to U.S. trade liberalization.\nTrump picks up McKinley’s mantle\nThe Republican Party’s main spokesman on tariff issues by the turn of the century was a short, middle-aged politician from Ohio named William McKinley, who had well-earned his nickname “the Napoleon of Protection” by the time he was elected president in 1896. For him, protectionism was akin to a religion.\nLike Trump, McKinley took a conspiratorial view of free trade, although, in contrast to Trump’s China, McKinley’s prime suspect was Britain, seeing Adam Smith’s invisible hand hidden behind any attempt to liberalize American trade.\nAs the go-to Republican spokesman concerning the tariff – the most dominant political issue in late-19th-century America – McKinley time and again charged anyone who advocated for lowering the country’s high tariff walls with being part of a vast transatlantic conspiracy. He said it involved “free trade leaders in the United States and the statesmen and ruling classes of Great Britain” and that American advocates of free trade were secret agents of “the manufacturers and the traders of England, who want the American market.”\nTrump’s protectionism is very Republican\nMcKinley’s hostility toward free trade was the Republican rule, not the exception.\nThe GOP remained the party of protectionism for the vast majority of its existence, well into the Cold War years. As Eisenhower Treasury Secretary George Humphrey roared at a 1954 cabinet meeting to protest trade liberalization with Japan, Republicans “were protectionists by history.”\nHow quickly Americans have forgotten that for most of its long history the GOP has sought to build American protective tariff walls ever higher – higher even than Trump’s envisaged wall separating the United States from Mexico.\nHistorically, GOP support for free trade since the Reagan era is the anomaly – a stance that in the past decade has become ever more unpopular among the party’s supporters. Internal fissures continue to develop, as more and more Republicans oppose free trade initiatives.\nIn other words, Trump’s protectionism is no radical departure from the party line. Indeed, it is very Republican.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        By — Gary Clyde Hufbauer Gary Clyde Hufbauer By — Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/column-why-the-trans-pacific-partnership-isnt-a-bum-deal Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Column: Why the Trans-Pacific Partnership isn’t a bum deal Economy Feb 5, 2016 4:39 PM EST Editor’s Note: The Trans-Pacific Partnership. This massive trade deal between the United States, Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam accounts for nearly 40 percent of global output and is anything but simple. We asked trade scholar Gary Hufbauer and Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs of the Peterson Institute to break down the nuts and bolts of the trade deal and make their case for it. — Kristen Doerer, Making Sen$e Editor “The TPP is a horrible deal,” Donald Trump said. “It’s a deal that’s designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.” “TPP is a disastrous trade agreement designed to protect the interests of the largest multinational corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment, and the foundations of American democracy,” Senator Bernie Sanders argued. With presidential candidates on both extremes denouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a bum deal, and with middle-ground candidates offering tepid support at best, it may be tempting to declare the Trans-Pacific Partnership dead on arrival. That would be a mistake. The agreement promises huge benefits for the U.S. economy and furnishes the economic pillar for U.S. geopolitical strategy in Asia. Economists Peter A. Petri and Michael G. Plummer estimate that implementation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would increase real incomes in the United States by $131 billion annually, or 0.5 percent of GDP, and U.S. exports by $357 billion or 9.1 percent over baseline projections. Equally important, a substantial majority of Republicans in Congress endorse the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and they are joined by a significant number of Democrats in Congress, whose critical support ensured the passage of Trade Promotion Authority “fast track” legislation earlier this year. MORE FROM PBS NEWSHOUR Hillary Clinton says she does not support Trans-Pacific Partnership A more accurate assessment is that the Trans-Pacific Partnership faces a rocky road to Congressional ratification. Fortunately, most of the rocks are in Washington, not spread across the Pacific in the capitals of other member countries. Once Congress gives its assent, legislators in the 11 partner countries will almost certainly approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Congressional timeline But an elaborate timeline governs U.S. Congressional assent. President Obama started the clock on Nov. 5, 2015 when he made the entire Trans-Pacific Partnership text public and simultaneously notified Congress of his intent to sign the agreement on behalf of the United States. Under authorizing fast-track legislation, the President must wait 90 days before actually signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The 12 countries signed the agreement on Feb. 4, 2016 in New Zealand. Meanwhile, the Obama administration and Congress must work together to draft implementing legislation. Under U.S. practice, it is the implementing legislation, enacted pursuant to Trade Promotion Authority, not the actual Trans-Pacific Partnership text, which has the force of domestic law. Trade implementing legislation can, and usually does, contain special features — not ordained by the text of the trade agreement — to answer the demands of key congressmen who may be unsatisfied with certain features of the deal. (For example, the carve-out of tobacco-related claims from investor-state dispute settlement or the permitted use of data localization in the financial services sector.) Once the implementing legislation has been agreed upon, it’s up to President Obama to decide when he wants to submit the legislation for congressional ratification — most likely after he has insured the congressional votes. Congress must then take an up-or-down vote on the entire legislation, with no amendments, within 90-legislative days — this expedited timeline is the heart of fast track authority. Following this timeline, the earliest time for a ratification vote appears to be late spring 2016 — in the midst of the presidential primary season. Entry into force If Congress passes the trade legislation, the stage will be set for other countries to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And without doubts about U.S. participation, it looks likely that they will. But there’s a caveat — and a rather large one at that. Before the Trans-Pacific Partnership can enter into force for the United States, the President must certify that all other partners have faithfully implemented the agreement. Unless Congress ratifies the Trans-Pacific Partnership by summer 2016, this provision means that presidential certification seems unlikely while Obama sits in the Oval Office. In other words, if ratification is delayed, the next U.S. president could have a decisive say as to when, if ever, the trade deal is implemented. Contentious issues In the debate ahead, sparks will fly over just a handful of topics covered in the 6,000 pages of Trans-Pacific Partnership text, schedules and side letters. Here are three of the most incendiary issues: Currency values. Critics complain that negotiated tariff cuts of 5 percentage points or more can be overshadowed or undermined by currency devaluation either through market forces or central bank action — by which a country depresses the value of its currencies to increase exports. This fear is not unfounded. In fact, Korea did just that shortly after the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement entered into force in March 2012. The Trans-Pacific Partnership itself does not, however, directly address currency questions. Instead, these are covered in a separate “Declaration” by which the partner countries promise not to “manipulate” or “undervalue” their currencies as a means of boosting exports or restraining imports. Critics object that the currency declaration lacks hard-edged enforcement mechanisms, such as withdrawal of Trans-Pacific Partnership benefits. This is true. But in its defense, the declaration requires timely disclosure of the amount and composition of official reserves and calls for annual meetings between Trans-Pacific Partnership finance ministers to review exchange rates. These obligations represent a forward step. Patent and related standards. Chapter 18 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership requires member countries to protect and enforce intellectual property rights — patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets — pretty much according to U.S. practice. Among other safeguards, members are permitted to disregard intellectual property rights in the event of a health emergency or in the interests of national security. Some critics contend that U.S. laws already go too far in protecting patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, and thus, any extension of U.S. practice to other Trans-Pacific Partnership members is bad policy that will only benefit giant firms like Disney, Apple and Pfizer. MORE FROM MAKING SEN$E What you need to know about the Trans-Pacific Partnership Particularly contentious is that member countries must preserve the confidentiality of “marketing data” — scientific evidence that a pharmaceutical product is both safe and efficacious — of pharmaceutical drugs for at least five years. For biologics, Trans-Pacific Partnership countries must meet a minimum standard of eight years of data protection or alternatively offer comparable protection of at least five years combined with other measures, such as regulatory procedures. This prevents companies that produce generic forms of the same drug from using the original marketing data to satisfy safety and efficacy standards; thus, generic forms can’t come on to the market during the five-year window. So why was this provision included? For each new drug, the underlying animal and human tests typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The five- to eight-year confidentiality period enables the pioneering firm to recoup these costs and make a profit, especially in countries that do not allow patents on biologic products. This confidentiality period represents a U.S. concession in trade talks since U.S. law provides a 12-year confidentiality period for biologic drugs sold in the United States. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee whose leadership will be key to getting the deal through Congress, strongly objects to the five- to eight-year confidentiality period, because it gives U.S. biologic firms less protection. On the other hand, critics of data exclusivity are concerned that even a five-year period is too long. These arguments are as old as the patent system itself: the merits of rewarding invention versus the advantages of cheaper goods. The novel debate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership is whether the costs of rewarding invention should be partly paid by foreign consumers through higher prices that they pay for new drugs. Reflecting America’s technological leadership, U.S. negotiators insisted on a strong intellectual property rights chapter. From the standpoint of U.S. interests, it’s hard to say they were wrong. Investor-state dispute settlement. Chapter 9 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership establishes investment protections and lays out specific procedures for foreign investors to challenge host states in the event of expropriation or unfair treatment and to seek money damages through arbitration. Importantly, the chapter ensures the right of member countries to issue non-discriminatory regulations that protect health, safety and the environment. It also blocks virtually all challenges to such regulations by tobacco companies, and it limits claims by financial firms. Nevertheless, some critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), denounce any provision that enables foreign corporations to challenge host states. The critics fail to recognize that host states generally welcome investor-state dispute settlement (also referred to as ISDS) in order to attract foreign investment through the promise of fair play. From where we sit, it appears that the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiators got the balance right in Chapter 9. The Trans-Pacific Partnership’s critical role Leaving contentious issues aside, a strong case can be made for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It begins with dismal conditions in the world economy. Economic pundits have barely noticed, but the value and volume of world trade actually declined over the past year — a drop of about 4.5 percent in value terms. U.S. exports of manufactures illustrate the decline: down 5 percent in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014 — that is, $285 billion vs. $300 billion. For more than half a century after World War II, world trade, driven by policy liberalization, consistently expanded, year by year, 2 to 4 percentage points faster than the world economy. Foreign direct investment grew even faster. Rapid trade and investment growth supplied key ingredients of the best half century in recorded economic history. No more. Falling trade and direct investment are both a consequence and cause of global economic stagnation. Sluggish world demand for everything from copper and oil to furniture and computers obviously serves to retard trade volumes and values. But in addition, declining international trade and investment deprive the world economy of essential fuel. There are two big reasons for falling trade and investment, in addition to sluggish world demand: first, the virtual absence of major policy liberalization since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1995; and second, the proliferation of protective measures worldwide since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This is why the Trans-Pacific Partnership is critical. The pact shows that major countries are prepared to slash many existing trade and investment barriers and promise not to erect new ones. Once ratified, the trade deal will become a magnet for more countries to join — Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Colombia and others. It will inspire “competitive liberalization” — a race to remove barriers — not only in Asia , but also in Africa and perhaps even South America. With inspiration from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the world economy could again be paced by fast trade and investment growth. Finally, the geopolitics MORE FROM MAKING SEN$E Obama promotes trade deal in Asia, but tough fight remains at home Beyond the long-term economic benefits, the Trans-Pacific Partnership is seen as an essential economic arm of the Obama administration’s Asia “pivot” — a policy to rebalance U.S. attention and leadership to one of the world’s most dynamic regions, but also one beset by security challenges, from territorial disputes in the South China Sea to a nuclear-armed North Korea. In the United States, past experience has shown that without a strong geopolitical rationale, it’s hard to get the requisite political support for trade negotiating authority, much less a final deal. Put simply, Trans-Pacific Partnership means expanding trade and investment with like-minded countries that are also key regional allies. It’s worth remembering that new Asia-Pacific initiatives are evolving with or without the United States — China is pursuing its own regional trade deal (with several Trans-Pacific Partnership members) and touting ambitious initiatives like “One Belt, One Road” and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Successful passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be a signal of U.S. commitment to the region. But it will also spread U.S. influence via the Trans-Pacific Partnership ’s rule-based system and promotion of good governance — not only to current members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but to those new members to come.

With presidential candidates on both extremes denouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a bum deal, and with middle-ground candidates offering tepid support at best, it may be tempting to declare the Trans-Pacific Partnership dead on arrival. That would be a mistake. The agreement promises huge benefits for the U.S. economy and furnishes the economic pillar for U.S. geopolitical strategy in Asia. Economists Peter A. Petri and Michael G. Plummer estimate that implementation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would increase real incomes in the United States by $131 billion annually, or 0.5 percent of GDP, and U.S. exports by $357 billion or 9.1 percent over baseline projections. Equally important, a substantial majority of Republicans in Congress endorse the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and they are joined by a significant number of Democrats in Congress, whose critical support ensured the passage of Trade Promotion Authority “fast track” legislation earlier this year. MORE FROM PBS NEWSHOUR Hillary Clinton says she does not support Trans-Pacific Partnership A more accurate assessment is that the Trans-Pacific Partnership faces a rocky road to Congressional ratification. Fortunately, most of the rocks are in Washington, not spread across the Pacific in the capitals of other member countries. Once Congress gives its assent, legislators in the 11 partner countries will almost certainly approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Congressional timeline But an elaborate timeline governs U.S. Congressional assent. President Obama started the clock on Nov. 5, 2015 when he made the entire Trans-Pacific Partnership text public and simultaneously notified Congress of his intent to sign the agreement on behalf of the United States. Under authorizing fast-track legislation, the President must wait 90 days before actually signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The 12 countries signed the agreement on Feb. 4, 2016 in New Zealand. Meanwhile, the Obama administration and Congress must work together to draft implementing legislation. Under U.S. practice, it is the implementing legislation, enacted pursuant to Trade Promotion Authority, not the actual Trans-Pacific Partnership text, which has the force of domestic law. Trade implementing legislation can, and usually does, contain special features — not ordained by the text of the trade agreement — to answer the demands of key congressmen who may be unsatisfied with certain features of the deal. (For example, the carve-out of tobacco-related claims from investor-state dispute settlement or the permitted use of data localization in the financial services sector.) Once the implementing legislation has been agreed upon, it’s up to President Obama to decide when he wants to submit the legislation for congressional ratification — most likely after he has insured the congressional votes. Congress must then take an up-or-down vote on the entire legislation, with no amendments, within 90-legislative days — this expedited timeline is the heart of fast track authority. Following this timeline, the earliest time for a ratification vote appears to be late spring 2016 — in the midst of the presidential primary season. Entry into force If Congress passes the trade legislation, the stage will be set for other countries to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And without doubts about U.S. participation, it looks likely that they will. But there’s a caveat — and a rather large one at that. Before the Trans-Pacific Partnership can enter into force for the United States, the President must certify that all other partners have faithfully implemented the agreement. Unless Congress ratifies the Trans-Pacific Partnership by summer 2016, this provision means that presidential certification seems unlikely while Obama sits in the Oval Office. In other words, if ratification is delayed, the next U.S. president could have a decisive say as to when, if ever, the trade deal is implemented. Contentious issues In the debate ahead, sparks will fly over just a handful of topics covered in the 6,000 pages of Trans-Pacific Partnership text, schedules and side letters. Here are three of the most incendiary issues: Currency values. Critics complain that negotiated tariff cuts of 5 percentage points or more can be overshadowed or undermined by currency devaluation either through market forces or central bank action — by which a country depresses the value of its currencies to increase exports. This fear is not unfounded. In fact, Korea did just that shortly after the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement entered into force in March 2012. The Trans-Pacific Partnership itself does not, however, directly address currency questions. Instead, these are covered in a separate “Declaration” by which the partner countries promise not to “manipulate” or “undervalue” their currencies as a means of boosting exports or restraining imports. Critics object that the currency declaration lacks hard-edged enforcement mechanisms, such as withdrawal of Trans-Pacific Partnership benefits. This is true. But in its defense, the declaration requires timely disclosure of the amount and composition of official reserves and calls for annual meetings between Trans-Pacific Partnership finance ministers to review exchange rates. These obligations represent a forward step. Patent and related standards. Chapter 18 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership requires member countries to protect and enforce intellectual property rights — patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets — pretty much according to U.S. practice. Among other safeguards, members are permitted to disregard intellectual property rights in the event of a health emergency or in the interests of national security. Some critics contend that U.S. laws already go too far in protecting patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, and thus, any extension of U.S. practice to other Trans-Pacific Partnership members is bad policy that will only benefit giant firms like Disney, Apple and Pfizer. MORE FROM MAKING SEN$E What you need to know about the Trans-Pacific Partnership Particularly contentious is that member countries must preserve the confidentiality of “marketing data” — scientific evidence that a pharmaceutical product is both safe and efficacious — of pharmaceutical drugs for at least five years. For biologics, Trans-Pacific Partnership countries must meet a minimum standard of eight years of data protection or alternatively offer comparable protection of at least five years combined with other measures, such as regulatory procedures. This prevents companies that produce generic forms of the same drug from using the original marketing data to satisfy safety and efficacy standards; thus, generic forms can’t come on to the market during the five-year window. So why was this provision included? For each new drug, the underlying animal and human tests typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The five- to eight-year confidentiality period enables the pioneering firm to recoup these costs and make a profit, especially in countries that do not allow patents on biologic products. This confidentiality period represents a U.S. concession in trade talks since U.S. law provides a 12-year confidentiality period for biologic drugs sold in the United States. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee whose leadership will be key to getting the deal through Congress, strongly objects to the five- to eight-year confidentiality period, because it gives U.S. biologic firms less protection. On the other hand, critics of data exclusivity are concerned that even a five-year period is too long. These arguments are as old as the patent system itself: the merits of rewarding invention versus the advantages of cheaper goods. The novel debate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership is whether the costs of rewarding invention should be partly paid by foreign consumers through higher prices that they pay for new drugs. Reflecting America’s technological leadership, U.S. negotiators insisted on a strong intellectual property rights chapter. From the standpoint of U.S. interests, it’s hard to say they were wrong. Investor-state dispute settlement. Chapter 9 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership establishes investment protections and lays out specific procedures for foreign investors to challenge host states in the event of expropriation or unfair treatment and to seek money damages through arbitration. Importantly, the chapter ensures the right of member countries to issue non-discriminatory regulations that protect health, safety and the environment. It also blocks virtually all challenges to such regulations by tobacco companies, and it limits claims by financial firms. Nevertheless, some critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), denounce any provision that enables foreign corporations to challenge host states. The critics fail to recognize that host states generally welcome investor-state dispute settlement (also referred to as ISDS) in order to attract foreign investment through the promise of fair play. From where we sit, it appears that the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiators got the balance right in Chapter 9. The Trans-Pacific Partnership’s critical role Leaving contentious issues aside, a strong case can be made for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It begins with dismal conditions in the world economy. Economic pundits have barely noticed, but the value and volume of world trade actually declined over the past year — a drop of about 4.5 percent in value terms. U.S. exports of manufactures illustrate the decline: down 5 percent in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014 — that is, $285 billion vs. $300 billion. For more than half a century after World War II, world trade, driven by policy liberalization, consistently expanded, year by year, 2 to 4 percentage points faster than the world economy. Foreign direct investment grew even faster. Rapid trade and investment growth supplied key ingredients of the best half century in recorded economic history. No more. Falling trade and direct investment are both a consequence and cause of global economic stagnation. Sluggish world demand for everything from copper and oil to furniture and computers obviously serves to retard trade volumes and values. But in addition, declining international trade and investment deprive the world economy of essential fuel. There are two big reasons for falling trade and investment, in addition to sluggish world demand: first, the virtual absence of major policy liberalization since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1995; and second, the proliferation of protective measures worldwide since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This is why the Trans-Pacific Partnership is critical. The pact shows that major countries are prepared to slash many existing trade and investment barriers and promise not to erect new ones. Once ratified, the trade deal will become a magnet for more countries to join — Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Colombia and others. It will inspire “competitive liberalization” — a race to remove barriers — not only in Asia , but also in Africa and perhaps even South America. With inspiration from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the world economy could again be paced by fast trade and investment growth. Finally, the geopolitics MORE FROM MAKING SEN$E Obama promotes trade deal in Asia, but tough fight remains at home Beyond the long-term economic benefits, the Trans-Pacific Partnership is seen as an essential economic arm of the Obama administration’s Asia “pivot” — a policy to rebalance U.S. attention and leadership to one of the world’s most dynamic regions, but also one beset by security challenges, from territorial disputes in the South China Sea to a nuclear-armed North Korea. In the United States, past experience has shown that without a strong geopolitical rationale, it’s hard to get the requisite political support for trade negotiating authority, much less a final deal. Put simply, Trans-Pacific Partnership means expanding trade and investment with like-minded countries that are also key regional allies. It’s worth remembering that new Asia-Pacific initiatives are evolving with or without the United States — China is pursuing its own regional trade deal (with several Trans-Pacific Partnership members) and touting ambitious initiatives like “One Belt, One Road” and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Successful passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be a signal of U.S. commitment to the region. But it will also spread U.S. influence via the Trans-Pacific Partnership ’s rule-based system and promotion of good governance — not only to current members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but to those new members to come.

The gender gap in bachelor’s degree completion appears in every major racial or ethnic group, though the size of the gap varies widely.\nIn 1995, young men and women were equally likely to hold a bachelor’s degree (25% each). Since then, there has been a growing gap between men and women in college completion.\nToday, 47% of U.S. women ages 25 to 34 have a bachelor’s degree, compared with 37% of men.\nThe share of young women with a bachelor’s degree has increased by 22 percentage points since 1995, from 25% to 47%. Over the same period, men have seen a smaller increase (12 points, from 25% to 37%).\nPew Research Center conducted this analysis to better understand the demographic characteristics driving the gender gap in bachelor’s degree completion in the United States.\nThis analysis uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement for 1995 to 2024. The CPS microdata files analyzed were provided by the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) at the University of Minnesota. The Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the CPS is conducted in March of each year and typically features an expanded sample of more than 75,000 households with about 70,000 interviews.\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey asked Americans without a bachelor’s degree why they chose not to seek one – and found some gender differences in the responses. For example, men without a bachelor’s degree were more likely than women to say they just didn’t want to get one. In turn, women without a bachelor’s degree were more likely than men to say they couldn’t afford a four-year degree.\nGender gaps in college completion by race and ethnicity\nWhite, Black, Hispanic and Asian women between the ages of 25 and 34 are all more likely than their male counterparts to have a bachelor’s degree. But some groups have made more gains over time than others.\nWhite, Black and Hispanic women have outpaced men in college completion in recent decades. For example, in 1995, young White women and men were equally likely to have a bachelor’s degree (29% each). The gap has increased to 10 points today (52% of White women vs. 42% of White men).\nSimilarly, in 1995, young Black women and men were about equally likely to have a bachelor’s degree (14% vs. 16%). Today, Black women are 12 points more likely than Black men to have one (38% of Black women vs. 26% of Black men).\nThere is also a growing gender gap between Hispanic men and women in college completion. In 1995, similar shares of Hispanic women and men had a bachelor’s degree (10% vs. 9%), but today the gap between groups is 9 points (31% vs. 22%).\nThe pattern is different for Asian adults, with women and men making comparable gains over the last few decades. In 1995, 42% of young Asian women and men had a bachelor’s degree. Today, 77% of young Asian women have one, as do 71% of young Asian men.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The growing gender gap in higher education – both in enrollment and graduation rates – has been a topic of conversation and debate in recent months. Young women are more likely to be enrolled in college today than young men, and among those ages 25 and older, women are more likely than men to have a four-year college degree. The gap in college completion is even wider among younger adults ages 25 to 34.\nWomen’s educational gains have occurred alongside their growing labor force participation as well as structural changes in the economy. The implications of the growing gap in educational attainment for men are significant, as research has shown the strong correlation between college completion and lifetime earnings and wealth accumulation.\nTo explore the factors contributing to the growing gender gap in college completion, we surveyed 9,676 U.S. adults between Oct. 18-24, 2021. Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.\nData on rates of college completion came from a Center analysis of Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (IPUMS). The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the data collection for the 2020 ASEC. The response rate for the March 2020 survey was about 10 percentage points lower than in preceding months. Using administrative data, Census Bureau researchers have shown that nonresponding households were less similar to respondents than in earlier years. They also generated entropy balance weights to account for this nonrandom nonresponse. The 2020 ASEC figures presented used these supplementary weights.\nHere are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.\nA majority (62%) of U.S. adults ages 25 and older don’t have a four-year college degree, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Current Population Survey data. But the reasons for not completing a four-year degree differ for men and women, according to a new Center survey of adults who do not have such a degree and are not currently enrolled in college.\nFinancial considerations are a key reason why many don’t attend or complete college. Among adults who do not have a bachelor’s degree and are not currently enrolled in school, roughly four-in-ten (42%) say a major reason why they have not received a four-year college degree is that they couldn’t afford college. Some 36% say needing to work to help support their family was a major reason they didn’t get their degree.\nOverall, about three-in-ten adults who didn’t complete four years of college (29%) say a major reason for this is that they just didn’t want to, 23% say they didn’t need more education for the job or career they wanted, and 20% say they just didn’t consider getting a four-year degree. Relatively few (13%) adults without a bachelor’s degree say a major reason they didn’t pursue this level of education was that they didn’t think they’d get into a four-year college.\nMen are more likely than women to point to factors that have more to do with personal choice. Roughly a third (34%) of men without a bachelor’s degree say a major reason they didn’t complete college is that they just didn’t want to. Only one-in-four women say the same. Non-college-educated men are also more likely than their female counterparts to say a major reason they don’t have a four-year degree is that they didn’t need more education for the job or career they wanted (26% of men say this vs. 20% of women).\nWomen (44%) are more likely than men (39%) to say not being able to afford college is a major reason they don’t have a bachelor’s degree. Men and women are about equally likely to say needing to work to help support their family was a major impediment.\nThe shares of men and women saying they didn’t consider going to college or they didn’t think they’d get into a four-year school are not significantly different.\nThe reasons people give for not completing college also differ across racial and ethnic groups. Among those without a bachelor’s degree, Hispanic adults (52%) are more likely than those who are White (39%) or Black (41%) to say a major reason they didn’t graduate from a four-year college is that they couldn’t afford it. Hispanic and Black adults without a four-year degree are more likely than their White counterparts to say needing to work to support their family was a major reason. There aren’t enough Asian adults without a bachelor’s degree in the sample to analyze this group separately.\nWhile a third of White adults without a four-year degree say not wanting to go to school was a major reason they didn’t complete a four-year degree, smaller shares of Black (22%) and Hispanic (23%) adults say the same. White adults are also more likely to say not needing more education for the job or career they wanted is a major reason why they don’t have a bachelor’s degree.\nIn some instances, the gender gaps in the reasons for not completing college are more pronounced among White adults than among Black or Hispanic adults. About four-in-ten White men who didn’t complete four years of college (39%) say a major reason for this is that they just didn’t want to. This compares with 27% of White women without a degree. Views on this don’t differ significantly by gender for Black or Hispanic adults.\nSimilarly, while three-in-ten White men without a college degree say a major reason they didn’t complete college is that they didn’t need more education for the job or career they wanted, only 24% of White women say the same. Among Black and Hispanic non-college graduates, roughly similar shares of men and women say this was a major reason.\nAmong college graduates, men and women have similar views on the value of their degree\nLooking at those who have graduated from college, men and women are equally likely to see value in the experience. Overall, 49% of four-year college graduates say their college education was extremely useful in terms of helping them grow personally and intellectually. Roughly equal shares of men (47%) and women (50%) express this view.\nSome 44% of college graduates – including 45% of men and 43% of women – say their college education was extremely useful to them in opening doors to job opportunities. A somewhat smaller share of bachelor’s degree holders (38%) say college was extremely useful in helping them develop specific skills and knowledge that could be used in the workplace (38% of men and 40% of women say this).\nThere are differences by age on each of these items, as younger college graduates are less likely than older ones to see value in their college education. For example, only a third of college graduates younger than 50, compared with 45% of those 50 and older, say their college experience was extremely useful in helping them develop skills and knowledge that could be used in the workplace.\nNote: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        When it comes to college enrollment and graduation rates, women continue to surpass men by large margins. In fact, according to recent data summarized by The Chronicle of Higher Education, the gender gap in college graduation is larger in some states than some racial/ethic differences in graduation rates.\nCollege Enrollment\nNationwide, women comprised 58% of all college students in 2020, up from 56.6% six years earlier. Women have outnumbered men among college students for decades, but the gap continues to widen. In 1979, about 200,000 more women were enrolled in college than men. By 2021, that difference had grown to about 3.1 million more women than men in college.\nUsing data from the U.S. Department of Education for fall 2020 college enrollments, The Chronicle found that women students outnumbered men in every state. In 13 states, women made up 60% or more of college students. West Virginia, where 50.2% of college students were women, had the lowest percentage difference between men and women students.\nThe enrollment gap reflects a gender difference both in high school graduation rates and the percentage of high school graduates who go on to college.\n- According to Brookings, for the graduating class of 2021, the graduation rates for the 30 states who had their data broken out by gender was 89.1% for girls and 82.9% for boys. Remember that 2021 was the year most affected by by the pandemic, so these results need to be viewed with caution, but the fact remains that in every single state for which a comparison was possible, girls graduated from high school at higher rates than boys.\n- Of the 3.1 million individuals ages 16 to 24 who graduated from high school between January and October 2023, 1.9 million, or 61.4%, were enrolled in colleges or universities in October of that year, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But there was an almost 8 percentage-point difference in college-going rates by women high school graduates (65.3%) versus men (57.6%).\nCollege Graduation Rates\nNationally, the six-year graduation rate in 2022 was 64.9%. The graduation rate for women (67.9%) was more than 6 percentage points higher than for men (61.3%). The graduation rate data are based on six-year graduation rates are for first-time, full-time, degree-seeking students who entered a degree-granting four-year institution in the fall of 2016.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nThe magnitude of gender gaps in graduation rates is revealed by the following comparisons:\n- In every single state, women’s graduation rate was higher than men’s.\n- In 16 states, women had a college graduation rate of 70% or higher (Massachusetts was tops with 78%), while men achieved that level in only two states (Massachusetts at 72.9% and Rhode Island at 71.3%).\n- Although racial/ethnic disparities in college success receive extensive attention in the press and by higher education leaders, the graduation gender gap exceeded the difference between the graduation rates of white and Hispanic students in several states. For example, in Florida, women’s graduation rate was 10 percentage points higher than men’s, while the difference between that state’s graduation rate for white and Hispanic students was only 2 percentage points. In Kentucky, the women vs. men graduation difference was 8.4 percentage points, almost twice the difference in rates for white and Hispanic students (4.6 percentage points).\nIn 2021-2022, women earned the majority of post-secondary degrees at every level, accounting for 62.8% of associate degrees, 58.5% of bachelor’s degrees, 62.6% of master’s degrees and 57% of doctoral degrees.\nExplaining the Differences\nSeveral factors have been identified as contributors to these gender gaps. Differences in the academic records of the sexes begin well before college. Girls significantly outperform boys in tests of reading in early grades. Girls complete more college-preparatory courses than boys in high school.\nA 2019 report from the U.S. Department of Education shows that 46.4% of high school girls took either an AP course or an IB course compared to only 37.8% of boys. While 12% of high school girls participated in dual enrollment programs, only 9.7% of high school boys did so. When these numbers are broken out by race, girls in all racial and ethnic groups were more likely than boys to earn credits in these pre-college courses.\nAmong adults, men are more likely than women to cite factors that reflect personal choices to not attend college or complete their degrees. According to the Pew Research Center, about a third (34%) of men without a bachelor’s degree say a major reason they didn’t finish college is that they just didn’t want to. Only one-in-four women said the same. Men were also a bit more likely than women to say a major reason they don’t have a four-year degree was that they didn’t need more education for the job they wanted.\nWhatever the reasons, the differences between men and women in college participation and success have profound implications for the future composition of the nation’s labor force, which increasingly is placing a premium on advanced knowledge and skills, and for the economic well-being of individuals, who stand to gain a substantial lifetime earnings premium from completing higher levels of education.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

I was wondering your stats were, What was your SAT/ACT? GPA? Did you take any AP/honors classes? It’s nice to have someone know and relate to that feeling. I’m so desperate to get in, it’s my dream school since I was a little kid. Send me a message sometime so we can maybe help each other out.\nI didn’t realize there was a wait list for IU. We did just hear when we were at Red Carpet days last week that they had something like 41,000 applications received. I think with them accepting the Common App this year, it brought in a lot more applicants than they normally get.\nWhat are your Stats?\n@gtv35 & @dcolosi 3.5 gpa and 23 ACT 4 AP classes and tons of honors classes\nIU accepts 30% of students off the waitlist, however you mostly likely won’t get in right away. I did some research and I found that, IU accepts waitlisted students from 3.0-3.5 range and puts them into the Hoosier Link Program with Ivy Tech. Hoosier Link students can live on-campus at Bloomington but take classes at Ivy Tech for the first semester. If you have above 2.5 GPA in those Ivy Tech classes then you will get in the second semester of your freshman year. Basically, Hoosier Link students can do everything a regular IU student does but can’t take classes at IU.\n@gvt35 thanks for sharing. I never knew about that program but just Googled it and found the information. So it also stated that you have to be an Indiana Resident from what I saw. I’ve heard of similar programs at other schools but didn’t realize IU had one.\n@cspence101 my D knows some people with similar stats that were flat rejected so the fact you at least are waitlisted hopefully is a positive sign. You might be best to just reach out to Administration and ask them about how the process works. By calling them you will also be showing them you are interested. Not sure how much IU looks at interest when reviewing but probably won’t hurt.\n@dcolosi thank you for the input, I called admissions and was given the 30% chance statistic as well.\nGood luck to you. I read about the Link program and it does look like a good way to gain full admissions if you get that option. I know you could always do a year somewhere else and then transfer. I know its always a stressful time so best to look at all your options and figure out what will work best for you. Best of luck.\nYou should definitely send your mid year grades. My daughter applied early action and received notification from IU that they needed her mid year grades before making a decision and they suggested she re-test. She did not re-test, but she did have her high school counselor send her mid year grades. She received her acceptance last week. Good luck!\n@mom.3.x what were her stats? Also, I sent my mid year grades a while ago. Thanks for the suggestion.\nThe same thing happened to me. I applied to IU early action and was deferred. So I was told to take another SAT/ACT to boost my competitiveness, so I did, and got a really crappy score. So I sent them my mid year grades and I got in. If you were wondering, my ACT score was a 19, my highest SAT was a 1060, and my GPA is a 3.53.\nGood luck to you and stay positive!\n@gvt35 I was wait-listed with a 3.5 and an 1160 SAT. Are you sure that if you are admitted off the wait list that we would be put in the Hoosier link program. Because I would attend Indiana only if put on the main campus.\nMy son has been waitlisted. Has anyone received notification that they were accepted off the waitlist yet? IU admissions is pessimistic on how deep they will go into the waitlist this year.\nUPDATE * I was just recently admitted off the waitlist on June 1, 2017. What I did was I woke up early and drove four hours by myself from my home in Northern Indiana to the Bloomington campus. I went to the admissions office and asked for an unscheduled meeting with the admissions officer for my region. I spoke with my admissions officer for about 5 minutes. Weeks after that meeting, I sent in additional materials such as letters of recommendations and a supplemental essay explaining specifically why I wanted to go to this campus. I kept contact with my admissions officer through email. This went on for 3 months. But I extremely relieved and happy that I was accepted to my dream school. Just showing your interest for the school can go a long way. This year was incredibly competitive over 40,000 students applied. Good Luck to all those families with students still on the waitlist. PS. BE AWARE THAT THE SCHOOL HAS MINIMAL FINANCIAL AID FOR WAITLISTED STUDENTS AT THIS POINT.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Incoming Students: UM awards merit-based scholarships to incoming undergraduate students based on their achievements.

Donate online to Disability Rights Ohio\nDisability Rights Ohio issues investigative report on Rose Mary Center\nOn March 11, 2014, Disability Rights Ohio issued a report on its investigation of Rose Mary Center, a 42-bed intermediate care facility in Cuyahoga County for children and adolescents with developmental disabilities. Disability Rights Ohio’s report is based on a review of Rose Mary Center’s records, examination of licensing and oversight documents from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and the Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities (DODD), on-site inspection and observation of the facility, and speaking with Rose Mary Center staff and residents.\nDRO’s investigation found that Rose Mary Center is poorly maintained; the facility provides minimal programming, supervision, and engagement of the children and adolescents; equipment in the facility is in disrepair and not readily accessible to the residents; and finally, numerous incident reports were filed that allege physical or verbal abuse by staff. DRO recommended that ODH and DODD conduct rigorous inspections of the facility and impose appropriate sanctions in order to hold the facility and staff accountable and to ensure the health and safety of the residents. DRO also recommended increased documentation of injuries and incidents, and that all residents be assessed to determine whether their needs could be better met in their own homes and communities.\nFollowing the DRO report, DODD, which licenses the facility, conducted an on-site review, stationed a monitor at the facility, and suspended Rose Mary Center from accepting new residents based on non-compliance with state codes. ODH has also conducted a recent review of the facility, but the results of that review are not yet public.\nRead the report: Rose Mary Center Report [PDF]\nCleveland Plain Dealer article: State investigating Rose-Mary Center in Euclid over care of residents with disabilities\nWKYC-TV: Investigator: Report cites substandard care at Euclid youth home [video]\nCleveland Plain Dealer: Rose-Mary Center, focus of state examination, has been cited numerous times in the past, records show\nThe News-Herald: Rose-Mary Center in Euclid might lose license\nDisability Rights Ohio files joint \"friend of the court\" brief in support of combat veteran\nDisability Rights Ohio jointly filed an amicus brief in support of a combat veteran appealing his case before the Ohio Supreme Court. His attorneys argued that the court did not properly consider how military service and combat can affect people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They contend his actions were tied to his PTSD and that his experiences in Iraq worsened his pre-existing substance abuse and led him to attempt \"suicide by cop.\"\nDisability Rights Ohio attorney Kristen Henry collaborated with the counsel for the defendant and other amicus organizations on defense strategy and other issues and was invited to sit at the counsel table at the Ohio Supreme Court hearing [video].\nThe defendant is appealing a 27-year sentence for two counts of aggravated assault, including seven years for using a gun to commit the crimes, in exchange for the prosecution dropping two counts of attempted aggravated murder.\nOther organizations signing on to the brief include Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation, National Disability Rights Network, National Alliance on Mental Illness of Ohio and Ohio Empowerment Coalition. An amicus curiae brief is additional information submitted to the court by interested, but non-related parties who have some knowledge or perspective that make their views valuable to the court.\nThe decision by the Ohio Supreme Court will help determine how courts should decide sentencing in future cases involving combat veterans where there is evidence of service-related disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder. No immediate decision is expected.\nCleveland Plain Dealer article: Ohio Supreme Court case focuses on what impact military-related disabilities should have on sentencing\nRead the brief: Merit Brief of Amici Curiae [PDF]\nDD Awareness and Advocacy Day\nThe 2014 Developmental Disability (DD) Awareness and Advocacy Day was held on March 4th at the Ohio Statehouse. The theme for the event was “What Are You Waiting For?,\" bringing awareness to the issue of individuals stuck on the waiting list for a Home and Community Based Services waiver. The day was full of events including networking and informational opportunities for stakeholders and guests, inspirational speakers and personal visits with legislative staffers.\nDisability Rights Ohio sponsored a booth at the event and sent a large group of staff volunteers to assist with registration and to help guests find their meetings.\nIn the Statehouse Atrium, guests were able to hear from John Martin, Director of Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities and several individuals from the DD community including Angie Bevington, owner of AngieShred. Speakers discussed a wide variety of issues ranging from how to advocate for oneself to working in the community.\nDisability Rights Ohio was also well represented by the event’s speakers. Adam Moss, a former intern of Disability Rights Ohio, spoke about his experience with the TOPS program at The Ohio State University. “I love being a Buckeye,” he proudly told the crowd. He filled the room with his inspirational story built on opportunities like working for Disability Rights Ohio. “It is in hard work that everyone can achieve their dreams,” he explained.\nOhio Developmental Disabilities Council (ODDC) announced completion of a study that evaluated the state's waitlist for home and community based services. Based on the report, ODDC plans to ask state officials to supply more waivers to some of the 41,000 people currently on the waiting list for Medicaid waivers for home-based services.\nRead the ODDC report: What Are We Waiting For? Waiver Supported Services Needed by Individuals and their Caregivers\nAre you experiencing a denial or delay of vocational rehabilitation (VR) services?\nAre you experiencing a denial or delay of vocational rehabilitation (VR) services (example: being told to wait for services, being told to take a break from a work placement, or similar situations)? Have you been told that this is due to a funding restriction or other problem? If so, please contact Disability Rights Ohio, we would like to hear your story.\nLast year the federal government was worried that Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities (OOD) had not been following the rules when it was working with private providers to deliver services. These private providers included programs such as the Bridges to Transition (“Bridges”) Program. Sometimes they are called “VRP3” programs. OOD agreed to change the way it worked with the private providers. But, there is a possibility that services offered through private providers could be delayed or denied. Examples of services provided by private providers include job coaches, training programs, tuition assistance, interpreting services or other services that help people with disabilities find or maintain employment. If this happens to you, you should ask your counselor or coordinator to explain why this is happening and what you can do about it. You should also ask what your appeal rights are.\nDisability Rights Ohio wants to make sure that individuals are able to receive the VR services that they need. If you experience a denial of services or a slow-down of services, please call Disability Rights Ohio at 800-282-9181 (TTY 800-858-3542) and dial “2” for our intake department. If you contact us, and your problem is because of VRP3 funding, we have the ability to contact OOD and resolve the issue. We want to hear from you.\nDisability Rights Ohio in the News\nRuth Colker, DRO Board member and Distinguished University Professor at the Moritz College of Law at the Ohio State University, wrote an op-ed for the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\nProposed Ohio laws mark step backwards for people with disabilities: Ruth Colker - Cleveland Plain Dealer\nKerstin Sjoberg-Witt is quoted in an article about the Parmadale closure.\nParmadale closes its doors this week to residential treatment of youths; plans to offer drug treatment to adults - Cleveland Plain Dealer\nDRO is mentioned in an article about a State investigation at Rose Mary Center in Euclid, Ohio\nState investigating Rose-Mary Center in Euclid over care of residents with disabilities - Cleveland Plain Dealer\nDRO was mentioned in an article about what impact military-related disabilities should have on sentencing decisions\nOhio Supreme Court case focuses on what impact military-related disabilities should have on sentencing - Cleveland Plain Dealer\nDRO's Rose-Mary Center report is referenced in this TV investigative report\nInvestigator: Report cites substandard care at Euclid youth home [video] - WKYC-TV\nMichael Kirkman, Executive Director at Disability Rights Ohio is quoted in this article about Rose-Mary Center\nRose-Mary Center, focus of state examination, has been cited numerous times in the past, records show - Cleveland Plain Dealer\nKerstin Sjoberg-Witt is quoted in an article about Rose Mary Center\nRose-Mary Center in Euclid might lose license - The News-Herald\nBills to Watch:\nU.S. Congress: The Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act\nA bill was recently introduced in U.S. Senate called the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act. This legislative measure would create tax-free savings accounts for individuals with disabilities. ABLE accounts could the ease financial strains of individuals with disabilities by allowing them and their families to save pre-tax income for qualified expenses. ABLE account would be similar to college savings accounts, health savings accounts, and individual retirement accounts that are already legal under federal law. ABLE savings could be used for essential expenses for individuals with disabilities, including medical care, education, community based supports, employment training, assistive technology, housing, and transportation. The bill specifies that ABLE would supplement programs like Medicaid and supplemental security income (SSI), and employment income and ABLE savings would not count against an individual’s eligibility for any other federal benefits program. The bill also contains provisions to protect against Medicaid fraud and a Medicaid pay-back provision if funds remain when beneficiary passes away. DRO will monitor the bill throughout the federal legislative process, and encourages the public to contact us with questions or comments about this bill.\nHouse Bill 361\nThe Ohio House Committee on Health and Aging is considering House Bill (HB) 361, which would require insurance companies in Ohio to include coverage for treatment related to acquired brain injury, including traumatic brain injury (TBI). Traumatic Brain injuries are a common cause of disability in adults, especially veterans of the U.S. armed forces, and they can severely limit an individual’s ability to complete day-to-day functions. When insurance plans fail to cover rehabilitative treatment for brain injuries, individuals may be financially unable to receive the rehabilitative therapies and treatment necessary to continue to work and do other fulfilling activities. DRO applauds Representatives Anne Gonzales and Ryan Smith for introducing HB 361 and will continue to follow its progress in the House. For more information on Disability Rights Ohio’s work for individuals with TBI, check out the article, “March is Brain Injury Awareness Month” in this month’s newsletter.\nVoter Bill of Rights Initiative\nA “Voters Bill of Rights” amendment to the Ohio constitution may be headed for the November 4, 2014 ballot if more than 385,000 signatures can be secured before July 2, 2014. The proposed initiative’s amendment summary indicates that it would put specific voter rights and protections into the state constitution, including an emphasis on ballot accessibility, expanded early voting opportunities, and on-line registration. DRO is dedicated to advocating for the rights of Ohio voters with disabilities and ensuring that the state fulfills its obligations to those voters under the federal law. An amendment adding these specific rights to the Ohio constitution would expand and enhance Ohioans with disabilities’ voices in our democracy.\nFor more information on voting rights for individuals with disabilities, check out DRO’s information page on the subject.\nMarch is Brain Injury Awareness Month\nMarch is Brain Injury Awareness month. A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a blow, jolt or bump to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the normal function of the brain. TBI can happen to anyone. 2.4 million people, including 475,000 children, sustain a TBI in the U.S. each year. 5.3 million individuals live with life-long disability as a result of TBI. In Ohio, people with TBI, experts, advocates and others are trying to improve services and supports for people living with TBI.\nThe move of Ohio’s Brain Injury Program from the Rehabilitation Services Commission to the Ohio Valley Center for Brain Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center is one effort to improve services. The mission of the Ohio Valley Center for Brain Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation is to conduct research, provide education and develop programs to improve the quality of life of persons who experience traumatic brain injury, so it is well suited to house Ohio’s Brain Injury Program. The Brain Injury Program for Ohio is advised by Ohio’s statewide advisory committee, known as the Brain Injury Advisory Committee (BIAC).\nDisability Rights Ohio (DRO) participates on the BIAC, which helps to bring stakeholders together to improve services and supports to people with TBI. Recently, DRO worked with the Brain Injury Program to support its efforts to apply for a grant which would fund a project to help the identification of people with TBI and their need for accommodations necessary for living in the community. If funded, this project would remove barriers to living in the community by providing services and supports that recognize and accommodate the effects of TBI. DRO continues to monitor issues important to people with TBI, such as H.B. 361, proposed state legislation to require insurance companies to provide coverage for “acquired brain injuries.” DRO looks forward to its continued efforts to reach out to Veterans and service members with disabilities, including TBI, by attending regional meetings throughout the state of the Regional Inter-service Family Assistance Committees (RISFAC) which serve to connect the military community with national, state, regional and community resources.\nTraumatic brain injury can happen to anyone. An injury that happens in an instant can bring a lifetime of physical, cognitive and behavior challenges. You can’t plan for a brain injury, but once it happens, access to the appropriate services and supports will greatly increase overall quality of life. Advocates in Ohio are working to ensure that these services and supports are available. For more information about TBI supports and services in Ohio, contact the Brain Injury Association of Ohio or the National Brain Injury Information Center at 1-800-444-6443.\nDisability Rights Ohio welcomes attorneys Michael Stack and Samantha Pyatt\nDisability Rights Ohio is participating in Florida Coastal School of Law’s Graduate Assistance Program to provide new attorneys with short-term employment opportunities to gain experience and continue to develop their skills. Disability Rights Ohio welcomes Michael Stack and Samantha Pyatt to the team.\nStack earned his undergraduate degree from Auburn University and his law degree from Florida Coastal School of Law.

Refer to Schedule A-GR for the determination of New Jersey gross receipts.\nTax periods of less than 12 months are subject to the higher minimum tax if the prorated total payroll exceeds $416,667 per month.\nDisposition of Revenues\nRevenues collected from general business corporations are deposited in the State Treasury for general State use. Revenues collected from banking and financial corporations are distributed 25% to counties, 25% to municipalities, and 50% to the State.\nArticle 8, Section 2, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution was amended to dedicate 4% of Corporation Business Tax revenue to fund hazardous discharge cleanup, underground storage tank improvements, and surface water quality projects.\nP.L. 2002, c. 40, s. 32 created within the General Fund a restricted reserve fund to be known as the “Corporation Business Tax Excess Revenue Fund.”\nHistory\nCorporation Business Taxes date back to 1884 when a franchise tax was imposed upon all domestic corporations. Between 1884 and 1946, the franchise tax was based upon the total amount of capital stock issued by the taxpayer and outstanding as of January 1 of each year (P.L. 1884, c. 159).\nThere was no franchise tax on foreign corporations prior to 1936, when provision was made for an annual tax (P.L. 1936, c. 264). This tax was replaced in 1937 (P.L. 1937, c. 25) with a new franchise tax providing for allocation of capital stock of foreign corporations.\nEffective January 1, 1946 (P.L. 1945, c. 162), the tax became a net worth tax applicable to both domestic and foreign corporations and measured by net worth allocated to New Jersey. Allocation was measured by the greater of an assets factor or a three-part business factor (property, sales, and payroll).\nP.L. 1954, c. 88, increased the tax on allocable net worth from 8/10 mills per $1 to 2 mills per $1.\nP.L. 1958, c. 63, amended the Corporation Business Tax Act by adding a tax at 1¾% based upon allocated net income to the tax based upon allocated net worth. The 1958 amendment also changed the tax year from a calendar year for all corporations to a privilege period coinciding with the accounting year for each taxpayer.\nIn 1975, the Corporation Business Tax was imposed on banking corporations and incorporated financial businesses.\nIn 1982, there was enacted into law a measure phasing out the Corporation Business Tax on net worth. The tax was phased out at 25% per year over a four-year period with taxpayers whose accounting or privilege periods began on or after April 1, 1983 (P.L. 1982, c. 55). The net worth tax has been eliminated for periods beginning after June 30, 1986.\nNet Income Tax rates have changed as follows:\n| Effective Date | Rate |\n| January 1, 1959 (P.L. 1958, c. 63) | 1¾% |\n| January 1, 1967 (P.L. 1966, c. 134) | 3¼% |\n| January 1, 1968 (P.L. 1968, c. 112) | 4¼% |\n| January 1, 1972 (P.L. 1972, c. 25) | 5½% |\n| January 1, 1975 (P.L. 1975, c. 162) | 7½% |\n| January 1, 1980 (P.L. 1980, c. 280) | 9 % |\nFor taxable years ending after June 30, 1984, a carryover of net operating loss was allowed as a deduction from entire net income for seven years following the year of the loss (P.L. 1985, c. 143).\nA surtax of 0.417% was invoked for privilege periods ending between July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1991; and 0.375% for privilege periods ending between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990, and July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1993. The 0.375% surtax on corporate net income was repealed effective January 1, 1994. The surtax had been scheduled to end July 1, 1994 (P.L. 1994, c. 3).\nA new jobs investment tax credit, enacted by P.L. 1993, c. 170, allows corporations to take a credit against Corporation Business Tax and property taxes for qualified investments in new or expanded business facilities resulting in new jobs in the State. The credit against Corporation Business Tax is for up to 50% of the portion of the tax that results from investment in new or expanded facilities. The credit was extended to midsize businesses by P.L. 2002, c. 40. P.L. 1993, c. 171, allows for a credit against Corporation Business Tax for investment in qualified equipment. The credit is 2% of the cost of qualified machinery purchased (the investment credit base). Taxpayers taking the 2% equipment credit may also take an employment credit of $1,000 per new employee (up to a maximum of 3% of the investment credit base). A small business benefit was added by P.L. 2004, c. 65. P.L. 1993, c. 175, allows for a credit for increased research activities.\nTwo changes in 1993 brought New Jersey corporation tax law into closer alignment with Federal corporation tax law. Chapter 172 allows corporations to use the Federal modified accelerated cost recovery system for depreciation of property under the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax for property placed in service for accounting years beginning after July 7, 1993. Chapter 173 allows, for the first time, an S election to be made under New Jersey law. As noted above, a New Jersey S corporation pays a reduced tax rate on that portion of entire net income not subject to Federal corporate income tax. The shareholder is taxed on net pro rata share of S corporation income under the Gross Income Tax.\nThe allocation formula for multistate corporations was changed in 1995. Under prior law, multistate corporation income was allocated to New Jersey based on equally weighted New Jersey property, payroll, and sales compared to total property, payroll, and sales. The new formula counts sales twice, so that sales account for half the allocation formula (P.L. 1995, c. 245).\nThe legislature continued to provide additional tax benefits for corporation business taxpayers. These include a tax benefit certificate transfer program to assist certain emerging companies (P.L. 1997, c. 334), later modified by P.L. 1999, c. 140 and P.L. 2004, c. 65, and supplemented by a credit transfer program P.L. 2004, C. 65, the Small New Jersey Based High Technology Business Investment Tax Credit Act (P.L. 1997, c. 349), the carryforward of net operating losses under the Corporation Business Tax for certain taxpayers (P.L. 1997, c. 350), the extension of the carryforward of the research and development tax credit (C.351, P.L. 1997), and the Neighborhood and Business Child Care Tax Incentive Program (P.L. 1999, c. 102).\nOther credits against Corporate Business Tax liability have also been enacted for effluent equipment (P.L. 2001, c.321), neighborhood revitalization (P.L. 2001, c. 415), HMO credit (P.L. 2000, c. 12), the economic recovery tax credit (P.L. 2002, c. 43), and the remediation tax credit (P.L.2003, c. 296).\nElectric and telephone companies were subjected to the Corporation Business Tax effective January 1, 1999.\nP.L. 1999, c. 369, excludes certain hedge fund activity income of corporations of foreign nations from taxation under the Corporation Business Tax.\nP.L. 2000, c. 12, provides that holders and former holders of a certificate of authority to operate a health maintenance organization are allowed a Corporation Business Tax credit for certain payments they are required to make.\nP.L. 2001, c. 23, provides for a three-year phase-out of the corporate taxation of the regular income of S corporations with annual income in excess of $100,000, and for S corporations whose net income is under $100,000 whose privilege periods end on or after July 1, 2001. Also, the bill provides for the adjusted minimum tax amount to be rounded to the next highest multiple of $10.\nP.L. 2001, c. 136, provides for the Corporation Business Tax payment obligations of certain partnerships and limited liability companies for privilege periods beginning on and after January 1, 2001.\nP.L. 2002, c. 40, among other things, effects the most extensive changes in the Corporation Business Tax since 1945. This law provides for a partnership filing fee, an alternative minimum assessment, nonresident partner withholding, a “throwout rule” on corporations apportioning income outside New Jersey, and new rules for related-party transactions. It also increases the minimum tax and broadens the definition of corporations that are subject to this tax.\nP.L. 2002, c. 43, includes some provisions for incentives in the form of Corporation Business Tax credits to qualifying taxpayers engaged in a business in the qualified municipality during the municipality’s “period of rehabilitation and economic recovery.”\nP.L. 2004, c. 47, limits the Corporation Business Tax application of net operating losses to 50% of taxable income for tax years 2004 and 2005.\nP.L. 2004, c. 65, decouples Corporation Business Tax from changes in Federal bonus depreciation and certain expensing principles under IRC section 179.\nP.L. 2005, c. 127, uncouples Corporation Business Tax from many provisions of the IRC Section 199 deduction for certain qualified production activities income.\nP.L. 2005, c. 318, allows Corporation Business Tax credit to businesses providing employment to qualified handicapped persons at sheltered workshops.\nP.L. 2005, c. 345, provides a credit under the Corporation Business Tax for film production expenses incurred in New Jersey and provides for the transfer of those tax credits to other taxpayers.\nP.L. 2006, c. 38, imposes a 4% surcharge on the Corporation Business Tax liability and increases the minimum tax.\nP.L. 2007, c. 89, increases the amount of State tax credits granted to businesses providing funding to qualified neighborhood revitalization projects.\nP.L. 2008, c. 120, applicable to privilege periods beginning on or after July 1, 2010, eliminates the throw-out provision of the apportionment formula for Corporation Business Tax. It also removes the “regular place of business” requirement for taxpayers to allocate income. To allocate less than 100% of income to New Jersey, a taxpayer is no longer required to show a regular place of business that exists outside of the State.\nP.L. 2011, c. 59, amends N.J.S.A. 54:10A-6 to replace the three-factor allocation formula of the Corporation Business Tax allocation factor with a single fraction formula. The change is phased in over three years, beginning with privilege periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012.\nInstallment Payments of Estimated Tax\nTaxpayers are required to make installment payments of estimated tax. The requirement for making these payments is based on the amount of the total tax liability shown on the most recent return.\n(a) If the total tax liability is $500 or more, the taxpayer must make installment payments. These payments are due on or before the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 12th month of the tax year.\n(b) If the total tax liability is less than $500, installment payments may be made as shown in (a) above or, in lieu of making installment payments, the taxpayer may make a payment of 50% of the total tax liability.\nThe Business Tax Reform Act (P.L. 2002, c. 40) provides for two significant changes regarding corporate estimated tax. First, for the tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all corporations must base their fourth quarter payment on 25% of the actual 2002 tax computed under the changes to avoid penalty. This one-time change supersedes the prior rules for estimated returns. The fourth quarter payment must be 25% of the year 2002 liability even if the corporation may have already satisfied all or substantially all of its year 2002 corporation tax liability through prior year’s overpayments or quarterly estimated payments in the first three quarters. The corporation must nonetheless remit 25% of the year 2002 tax to avoid penalties.\nSecondly, for large corporations with sales of over $50 million, beginning with the year 2003, the second and third quarter payments, normally due on the 15th day of the 6th and 9th months, will be combined into a single 50% payment due on the 15th day of the 6th month. No payments will be due for such corporations on the 15th day of the 9th month, and normal 25% payments will be due in the 4th and 12th months.\nPartnerships\nP.L. 2002, c. 40, establishes a $150 per partner filing fee for partnerships, LLPs, and LLCs deriving income from New Jersey sources. In general, the $150 per partner fee is based on the number of K-1s issued. For professional service corporations, the $150 fee applies for each registered professional who owns or is employed by the enterprise and is calculated using a quarterly average. In addition to the filing fee for the year, an installment payment equal to 50% of the filing fee is also required with the New Jersey partnership return. The annual fee is capped at $250,000.\nNew Jersey partnership payments made on behalf of out-of-State corporate and noncorporate partners are based on taxable income whether the income is distributed or undistributed and are designated as a tax at a rate of 9% for nonresident corporate partners and 6.37% for noncorporate partners. Qualified investment partnerships and partnerships listed on a U.S. national stock exchange are not subject to the tax. The calculation is based on the partnership’s “entire net income” multiplied by the partnership’s New Jersey apportionment percentages computed under the Corporation Business Tax, not under Gross Income Tax.\nP.L. 2002, c. 40, subjects savings banks and savings and loan associations to the Corporation Business Tax and repeals the Savings Institution Tax and the Corporation Income Tax.\nEffective beginning with the 2002 tax year, P.L. 2003, c. 256, exempts investment clubs from the $150 per owner annual partnership filing fee and from the requirement that partnerships remit Gross Income Tax payments on behalf of their nonresident noncorporate partners. To meet the definition of “investment club,” the partnership must have income below $35,000 per individual (up to a total of $250,000) and satisfy other limitations and criteria.\nP.L. 2005, c. 288, requires partners and other owners of pass-through entities to credit payments made on their behalf against estimated taxes to end double withholding. In addition, for privilege periods beginning on or after January 1, 2007, partnerships that are required to make tax payments on behalf of nonresident partners must make installment payments of 25% of that tax on or before the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, and 9th months of the privilege period, and on or before the 15th day of the 1st month following the close of the privilege period.\nBanking and Financial Corporations\nBanking and financial corporations are subject to the Corporation Business Tax Act at the rate of 9% on net income or to the lesser rates stated above if their income meets those thresholds.\nP.L. 1975, c. 170, provides that during each of privilege years 1976, 1977, and 1978, the amount paid by each banking corporation as taxes shall be the greater of (1) the amount which such banking corporation paid in calendar year 1975 as Bank Stock Tax, or (2) a sum equal to total of taxes paid by such banking corporation as Corporation Business Tax and Business Personal Property Tax.\nFormerly, banks were subject to a tax of 1.5% on net worth under the Bank Stock Tax Act. Bank Stock Tax was formerly administered by the Division of Taxation and the 21 separate County Boards of Taxation. The corporate tax upon banks is now administered solely by the Division.\nFinancial business corporations were formerly subject to the Financial Business Tax. These included such corporations as small loan companies and mortgage finance companies which are now subject to Corporation Business Tax.\nP.L. 1975, c. 171, provides that during each of the years 1976, 1977, and 1978, each financial business corporation shall pay as taxes, the greater of (1) a sum equal to the amount such financial business corporation paid under the Financial Business Tax Act in the calendar year 1975, or (2) a sum equal to the total of the taxes payable by such financial business corporation pursuant to the Corporation Business Tax Act. P.L. 1978, c. 40, extended the save harmless provision through 1979. It expired in 1980. As a result of changes in the Federal and State banking laws, interstate banking is now permitted (P.L. 1996, c. 17). An administrative rule adopted by the Division of Taxation (N.J.A.C. 18:7-1.14, effective June 16, 1997) sets forth certain conditions under which foreign banks and certain domestic banks will be taxed in New Jersey.\nInvestment Companies\nA taxpayer qualifying and electing to be taxed as an investment company is subject to an allocation percentage of 40% of the net income base. Investment companies are subject to a minimum tax of $500.\nRegulated Investment Company means any corporation which, for a period covered by its reports, is registered and regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 789), as amended.\nThe Corporation Business Tax on regulated investment companies was eliminated (P.L. 1983, c. 75), approved on February 24, 1983. Regulated investment companies in New Jersey were formerly taxed on both entire net worth and entire net income. These taxes were eliminated and a flat tax of $500 per year was imposed. For privilege periods beginning in calendar year 2012, regulated investment companies are subject to the same minimum tax on gross receipts as C corporations.\nReal estate investment trusts qualifying and electing to be taxed as such under Federal law are taxed at 4% of entire net income.\nDeferred Predissolution Payment\nP.L. 1973, c. 367, approved in 1974, eliminated the requirement for a certificate to be obtained in the case of merger or consolidation involving a domestic or foreign corporation qualified to transact business in New Jersey. It also provided alternatives to actual payment of taxes, or payment on account of such taxes by providing in lieu thereof, for a written undertaking to be given by a domestic corporation, or a foreign corporation authorized to transact business in New Jersey, to pay all taxes when payable on behalf of a corporation which otherwise would have to pay all taxes prior to taking certain corporate actions.\nAllocation Factor\nP.L. 2001, c. 59, signed on April 28, 2011, amended N.J.S.A. 54:10A-6 to replace the three-fraction allocation formula of the Corporation Business Tax allocation factor with a single sales fraction formula. The change was phased in over three years, beginning with privilege periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012. For privilege periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012 but before January 1, 2013, the sales fraction accounted for 70% of the allocation, and the property and payroll fractions each account for 15% of the allocation. For privilege periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 but before January 1, 2014, the sales fraction accounted for 90% of the allocation, and the property and payroll fractions each accounted for 5% of the allocation. For privilege periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014, the sales fraction accounts for 100% of the allocation.\nUnder prior law, a taxpayer was required to have a regular place of business outside New Jersey in order to allocate income. P.L. 2008 c. 120 repealed the “regular place of business” requirement for taxpayers to allocate income.\nThe Business Tax Reform Act (P.L. 2002, c. 40) imposes a “throwout rule” on corporations apportioning income outside the State. The tax effect of the throwout rule on an affiliated or controlled group having $20 million or more in net income is capped at $5 million.\nP.L. 2002, c. 40, also introduced an alternative minimum assessment (AMA) on apportioned gross receipts or gross profits of C corporations when the AMA exceeds the normal Corporation Business Tax. The assessment is based on either gross receipts or gross profits, with the taxpayer electing which formula to use. This formula must also be used for the next four tax periods. S corporations, professional corporations, investment companies, and unincorporated businesses are exempt from the AMA. The AMA also applies to non-New Jersey businesses deriving income from New Jersey sources with or without physical presence in the State that are not currently subject to the Corporation Business Tax.\nFor privilege periods beginning after June 30, 2006, the AMA is $0, except for taxpayers claiming exemption under Pub. L. 86-272, for whom the previously prescribed rate will continue. For privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2006, the AMA for taxpayers otherwise subject to the AMA that consent to jurisdiction and pay the Corporation Business Tax will be $0\nThe use of net operating losses is suspended for tax years 2002 and 2003. For 2004 and 2005 net operating losses were limited to 50% of taxable income.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        S corporations are corporations that elect to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. Shareholders of S corporations report the flow-through of income and losses on their personal tax returns and are assessed tax at their individual income tax rates. This allows S corporations to avoid double taxation on the corporate income. S corporations are responsible for tax on certain built-in gains and passive income at the entity level.\nTo qualify for S corporation status, the corporation must meet the following requirements:\n- Be a domestic corporation\n- Have only allowable shareholders\n- May be individuals, certain trusts, and estates and\n- May not be partnerships, corporations or non-resident alien shareholders\n- Have no more than 100 shareholders\n- Have only one class of stock\n- Not be an ineligible corporation (i.e. certain financial institutions, insurance companies, and domestic international sales corporations)\nIn order to become an S corporation, the corporation must submit Form 2553, Election by a Small Business Corporation signed by all the shareholders.

The 2017 Trump tax cuts invested in this engine of economic growth by providing a 20 percent small business tax deduction – otherwise known as Section 199A – which helped ensure shops lining Main Streets across the nation could compete with larger companies and empowered job creators by giving them the resources to invest in their businesses and their workers.\nBut, right now, America’s small business community is staring down a massive tax increase. Twenty-six million businesses could see their top tax rate more than double to 43.4 percent – roughly 20 points higher than businesses face in Communist China.\nWays and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) issued the following statement on the need to immediately protect America’s small businesses from a needless tax increase and give them the certainty now so that they can plan, invest, hire and grow:\n“Raising taxes on small businesses will harm our local economies, the nation’s broader economic competitiveness, and the workers that keep Main Street running. The power of small businesses to drive innovation and job creation is exactly why Republicans included the 20 percent small business tax deduction in the 2017 Trump tax cuts. This policy has also made them better able to compete with larger corporations. Congress must act as soon as possible to protect America’s workers, families, farmers, and small businesses from the threat of higher taxes. If we actually want our economy to perform as it did before the pandemic, we need to immediately let small businesses do what they do best – innovate, grow, and hire, and they can’t do that with the threat of a massive tax increase over their head.”\nKey Facts:\n- The 2017 Trump tax cuts provided a 20 percent small business tax deduction that helped put Main Street on a level playing field with large corporations.\n- If the Section 199A tax deduction expires, 26 million job creators will see their top tax rate increase to 43.4 percent.\nKey Policies from the Trump Tax Cuts Set to Expire if Congress Fails to Act:\n- Congress only has 149 legislative days next year to act before the Trump tax cuts expire.\n- The average taxpayer would see a 22 percent tax hike if the Trump tax cuts expire.\n- A family of four making $80,610, the median income in the United States, would see a $1,695 tax increase if the Trump tax cuts expire.\n- This is worth about 9 weeks of groceries to a typical family of four across the country.\n- 40 million families would see their household’s Child Tax Credit cut in half.\n- 91 percent of all taxpayers would see their guaranteed deduction slashed in half.\n- 26 million small businesses would be hit with a 43.4 percent top tax rate if the Section 199A Small Business Deduction expires.\n- 7 million taxpayers would be impacted by the return of the Alternative Minimum Tax.\n- 2 million family-owned farms would have their Death Tax Exemption slashed in half next year.\nREAD: Trump Tax Cuts Expiration Would Force Small Businesses to Pay Higher Tax Rate Than Communist China\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

In practice, his policies have sent jobs overseas.\n\"It’s an agenda that begins with jobs,\" President Obama proclaimed in his first State of the Union address. \"That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010,\" he promised a year later. \"At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country, or somewhere else,\" he continued last year. \"My plan,\" he insisted just last month, \"will stop giving tax breaks to businesses that ship jobs and factories overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs and manufacturing right here in the United States of America.\"\nAfter three and a half years of President Obama's economic policies, 23.4 million Americans are either unemployed or underemployed. Despite his rhetoric, the President has doled out American taxpayer dollars that all too often create jobs overseas instead of for Americans ready, able, and desperate for work.\n- The Energy Department admitted that 80 percent of some green energy programs -- including $2.3 billion in manufacturing tax credits -- benefitted foreign firms employing workers in China, South Korea, Spain, and other countries.\n- The federal government spent nearly $2 billion in stimulus money on wind power projects, but almost 80 percent of the money went to foreign manufacturers, financing an estimated 6,000 jobs overseas. Foreign-owned manufacturers built 1,219 of the 1,807 turbines erected on 28 wind farms.\n- Just weeks before the Department of Energy finalized a $1.2 billion loan guarantee for solar company SunPower, the company announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in Mexico instead of in the United States.\n- Vice President Biden applauded the Administration's $529 million loan guarantee to Fisker for its potential to generate thousands of American manufacturing jobs. Instead, the company created just 500 jobs, in Finland.\n- The Obama Energy Department gave $3.1 billion in loans to First Solar, which recently admitted that it employs more workers overseas than in the United States.\n- President Obama and Vice President Biden personally appeared at the groundbreaking of plants of two electric car battery companies that received a combined $300 million in federal stimulus dollars. Largely owned by Koreans, both businesses purchased Korean equipment and supplies, contracted with at least 11 Asian firms to perform construction work, and filled many sought-after jobs with Korean nationals.\n- The Administration doled out more than $7 million in federal stimulus funds to four Oregon forestry firms, which promptly hired 254 foreign nationals to do the work.\n- President Obama loaned $2 billion to Brazil’s state-owned oil company, Petrobras, to finance oil exploration off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, inexplicably choosing to spend taxpayer money to support Brazilian, not American, energy jobs.\n- One analyst estimated that job losses from the Obama Administration's six-month moratorium on deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico would cost 19,000 American jobs. The Obama Administration itself projected its deepwater drilling moratorium would destroy 23,000 jobs, then implemented the policy anyway.\n- The federal government gave one of California’s largest utilities a $337 million loan guarantee to build a solar plant in Arizona. The company will use 800,000 solar panels manufactured by China’s Suntech Power.\n- A federal stimulus grant for $817,000 to install television monitors on buses in Santa Clarita, California went to a New Zealand company, despite a qualified local contractor applying for the contract.\nPresident Obama has presided over 41 straight months of unemployment above eight percent. His policies have failed to help American businesses create jobs as he spent taxpayer money to help foreign workers. Meanwhile, unemployed Americans have been left with nothing but empty speeches and broken promises.\nNext Article Previous Article\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Medicaid accounts for one-fifth of health care spending, more than half of spending for long-term care, and a large share of state budgets. Medicaid is jointly financed by states and the federal government but administered by states within broad federal rules. Because states have a degree of flexibility to determine what populations and services to cover, how to deliver care, and how much to reimburse providers, there is significant variation across states in program spending and the share of state residents covered by the program.\nAt the start of 2025, many issues are at play that will affect Medicaid coverage, financing, and access to care. While Medicaid was not discussed much on the campaign trail, Congress may consider big changes as part of tax and spending debates and the Trump administration may make changes to Medicaid through executive actions. Amid the potential changes, this brief highlights ten key things to know about Medicaid.\n1. Nationally, one in five people have Medicaid, but this varies across the states.\nThe percentage of people who report having Medicaid is 21% nationally, but ranges from 11% in Utah to 34% in New Mexico (Figure 1). The percentage tends to be higher in the 41 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which includes 21 states that voted for Trump and 20 that voted for Harris. Rates of Medicaid coverage are also higher in states with lower average incomes and lower rates of health insurance offered through employers.\n2. Medicaid is a key source of coverage for certain populations.\nWhile Medicaid covers 1 in 5 people living in the United States, Medicaid is a key source of coverage for certain populations. In 2023, Medicaid covered nearly 4 in 10 children, over 8 in 10 children in poverty, 1 in 6 adults, and almost half of adults in poverty. Relative to White children and adults, Medicaid covers a higher share of Black, Hispanic, and American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) children and adults. Medicaid covers more than 1 in 4 adults ages 19-64 with disabilities, who are defined as having one or more difficulty related to hearing, vision, cognition, ambulation, self-care, or independent living (Figure 2).\nMedicaid provides coverage for several special populations. For example, Medicaid covers 41% of all births in the United States, nearly half of children with special health care needs, 5 in 8 nursing home residents, 29% of non-elderly adults with any mental illness, and 40% of non-elderly adults with HIV. Medicaid pays Medicare premiums and often provides wraparound coverage for services not covered by Medicare (like most long-term care) for nearly 1 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries (13 million). Medicaid is a key source of coverage for individuals experiencing homelessness and those transitioning out of carceral settings, particularly in states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion.\n3. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states.\nStates are guaranteed federal matching dollars without a cap for qualified services provided to eligible enrollees. The match rate for most Medicaid enrollees is determined by a formula in the law that provides a match of at least 50% and provides a higher federal match rate for states with lower per capita income (Figure 2). States may receive a higher match rate for certain services and populations. The ACA expansion group is financed with a 90% federal match rate, so states pay 10%; however, the American Rescue Plan Act included an additional temporary fiscal incentive to states that newly adopt the Medicaid expansion. In FY 2023, Medicaid spending totaled $880 billion of which 69% was federal spending. Total Medicaid spending typically accelerates during economic downturns because people may lose income and enroll in the program. To help states manage increased costs, the federal government has temporarily increased the federal share of Medicaid. Most recently, states received an increase in the match rate between 2020 and 2024 to help manage increased enrollment and costs due to the pandemic related continuous enrollment provision.\n4. Medicaid accounts for one fifth of all health care spending, and over half of spending on long-term care.\nMedicaid provides a major source of funding for the U.S. health care system, covering 19% of all health care spending and 19% of hospital spending (Figure 4). In addition to covering the services required by federal Medicaid law, all states elect to cover optional benefits including prescription drugs and home care. Home care, also known as home- and community-based services or HCBS, is long-term care provided in non-institutional settings including homes, day care centers, and assisted living facilities. Other long-term care is provided in institutions such as nursing facilities. Medicaid is the primary payer for long-term care in the United States, covering 61% of total spending. Beyond long-term care, Medicaid provides other benefits not usually covered by health insurance including non-emergency medical transportation, which helps enrollees get to appointments, and comprehensive benefits for children, known as Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) services.\n5. People who qualify for Medicaid based on age or disability account for more than half of spending.\nOverall, seniors and individuals with disabilities account for 23% of enrollment but 51% of spending whereas children account for 34% of enrollment, but 14% of spending (Figure 5). The disproportionate spending on certain eligibility groups stems from variation in spending per enrollee across the eligibility groups. Spending per enrollee was highest for enrollees ages 65 and older ($18,923) and eligible because of disability ($18,437). Seniors and people with disabilities often have higher health care costs than other enrollees due to more complex health care needs, higher rates of chronic conditions and being more likely to utilize long-term care. There is significant state variation in the percentage of Medicaid spending that pays for enrollees eligible because of a disability or being age 65 and older: In some states (Alaska, Nevada, Montana, Illinois, and Indiana), only a third of spending went to those populations, and in five states (Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi, and North Dakota), care for people eligible because of disabilities or being over age 64 accounted for at least two-thirds of spending.\n6. Flexibility to administer Medicaid results in variation in per enrollee costs across states.\nAcross the states, spending per full-benefit enrollee ranged from a low of $3,713 in Alabama to $10,229 in the District of Columbia in 2020 (Figure 6). Variation in spending across the states reflects considerable flexibility for states to design and administer their own programs – including what benefits are covered and how much providers are paid — and variation in the health and population characteristics of state residents as well as overall health care costs. Although all states are required to provide some Medicaid benefits, many others are optional, including prescription drugs (covered by all states), vision services, dental care and most home care. In recent years, states have expanded coverage of behavioral health services and benefits to help enrollees address social determinants of health (SDOH) like nutrition or housing.\n7. Three-quarters of all Medicaid enrollees receive care through comprehensive, risk-based MCOs.\nOverall, 75% of all Medicaid enrollees receive care through comprehensive, risk-based managed care organizations (MCOs) (Figure 7). Payments to MCOs accounted for more than half (52%) of Medicaid spending in FY 2023. As of July 2024, 42 states (including DC) contract with comprehensive MCOs. Medicaid MCOs provide comprehensive acute care (i.e., most physician and hospital services) and in some cases long-term care to Medicaid enrollees and are paid a set per member per month payment for these services. Medicaid MCOs represent a mix of private for-profit, private non-profit, and government plans. Five for-profit parent firms (Centene, Elevance (formerly Anthem), UnitedHealth Group, Molina, and CVS) account for 50% of all Medicaid MCO enrollment. States have increased their reliance on MCOs with the aim of improving access to certain services, enhancing care coordination and management, and making future costs more predictable. While the shift to MCOs has increased budget predictability for states, the evidence about the impact of managed care on access to care, costs, and outcomes is both limited and mixed.\n8. Medicaid coverage facilitates access to care, improves health outcomes, and provides financial protection from medical debt.\nA large body of research shows that Medicaid beneficiaries have substantially better access to care than people who are uninsured (who are also primarily low-income) and are less likely to postpone or go without needed care due to cost, as federal rules generally limit out of pocket Medicaid costs. Key measures of access to care among Medicaid enrollees are generally comparable to rates for people with private insurance (Figure 8). Gaps in access to certain providers (e.g., psychiatrists and dentists) is an ongoing challenge in Medicaid that may reflect system-wide problems, but may be exacerbated by provider shortages in low-income communities, Medicaid’s lower physician payment rates, and lower Medicaid physician participation compared with private insurance.\nLongstanding research shows that Medicaid eligibility during childhood is associated with positive effects on health (including reduced avoidable hospitalizations and mortality) and impacts beyond health, such as improved long-run educational attainment. Early and updated research findings show that state Medicaid expansions to low-income adults are associated with increased access to care, increased economic security, improved self-reported health status, and other outcomes including increased early-stage cancer diagnosis rates, lower mortality rates for certain conditions (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease), decreased maternal mortality, improved treatment management for conditions (e.g., diabetes, HIV), and improved outcomes related to substance use disorders. Research conducted by NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research) suggests that the ACA Medicaid expansion had impacts beyond health care use, including on consumer financial outcomes – reducing unpaid bills and medical debt sent to collections.\n9. Section 1115 demonstration waivers reflect changing priorities across presidential administrations.\nSection 1115 demonstration waivers offer states an avenue to test new approaches in Medicaid that differ from what is required by federal statute, if [in the HHS Secretary’s view] the approach is likely to “promote the objectives of the Medicaid program.” Waivers generally reflect priorities identified by states as well as changing priorities from one presidential administration to another (Figure 9). Waivers have been used to expand coverage or benefits, change policies for existing Medicaid populations (e.g., testing premiums or other eligibility requirements), modify delivery systems, restructure financing or authorize new payments (e.g., supplemental payments or incentive-based payments), as well as make other program changes. Waivers vary in size and scope. States can obtain “comprehensive” Section 1115 waivers that make broad program changes or narrow waivers focused on a specific population. Nearly all states have at least one active Section 1115 waiver and some states have multiple 1115 waivers.\n10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.\nIn the most recent KFF tracking poll, more than three-fourths (77%) of Americans held favorable views of Medicaid, including six in ten Republicans (63%), and at least eight in ten independents (81%) and Democrats (87%) (Figure 10). Medicaid is also viewed favorably by a majority of voters who say they voted for President Trump in the 2024 election (62%). Nearly half of the public (46%) say the federal government doesn’t spend enough on the Medicaid program, with another third (33%) saying it spends “about the right amount,” and around one in five (19%) saying it spends “too much.” With possible changes to government health programs, seven in ten (72%) say they are worried about the level of benefits that will be available to people covered by Medicaid in the future\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        How to pick a health insurance plan\nYour total costs for health care: Premium, deductible & out-of-pocket costs\nWhen picking a Marketplace health plan, it's important to compare your estimated total yearly costs for each plan - not just the premium. The costs when you get care can have a big impact on your budget. Total yearly costs include:\n- Monthly premium x 12 months: The amount you pay to your plan each month to have health insurance.\n- Deductibles: How much you'll spend for certain covered health services and prescription drugs before your plan pays anything, except free preventive services. (For example, your plan may charge for an office visit, but you won't pay extra for the preventive service that's part of that visit.)\n- Copayments and coinsurance: The amounts you pay your health care provider each time you get care, like $20 for a doctor visit or 30% of hospital charges.\n- Out-of-pocket maximum: The most you'll spend for covered services in a year. After you reach this amount, the insurance company pays 100% for covered services.\nCompare estimated total costs for plans\nTo find a plan that meets your needs and budget, consider:\nYour health care needs when shopping for coverage\nDetermine the types and amount of health services and prescription drugs your household will likely use for the year. Deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance can add a lot to your total yearly costs - sometimes more than a plan's premium.\nWhen you compare plans, you can get a more accurate estimate of your total yearly costs for each plan, based on the level of care you think your household will use for the year. To preview plans and prices:\n- Select \"Add yearly cost\" on any of the plans listed.\n- Pick the level of care you expect to use this year— low, medium, or high.\n- Select \"Save and continue\" to get your estimated total yearly costs for each plan listed.\nYour actual costs will vary based on the services you use. This estimate can help you compare each plan's total impact on your household budget.\nCompare plans marked with \"easy pricing\"\nThese plans:\n- Have the same out-of-pocket costs and care before deductibles for some services.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

So, the Treasury Department—President Trump had a press conference yesterday, next door, in which he announced a whole new global tariff regime. He’d been promising to do this, well, for 40 years, really. It came not out of nowhere, but it was clearly his intent all along, as stated. But it did rattle people, including some of his supporters. So I just wanted to ask you, big picture: where do you think this leads?\nSec. Scott Bessent: Well, Tucker, thank you for having me. And as you said, the President's been talking about this for four decades. Yes. And this is transformational for the American economy, for the American worker, and for the new Republican alignment. And it’s a combination of the old and new ideas. Some of the old ideas were put away. You know, I always tell everyone—and they don't want to hear it—the original tariff man was Alexander Hamilton. Yes. And he used tariffs to fund the new nation and to protect American industry. President Trump has added a third leg to the stool—he uses tariffs to negotiate. But I think this is not unlike... I was a freshman in college when Ronald Reagan came in, in 1980. A new day in America. And when I talk to people now, and they look back and they look at the Reagan years so fondly—yes, I remember what it was like. And it was choppy. The President? Very choppy. Very choppy. But President Reagan stood the course. And look, this is not an invitation—but at one point in the early ’80s, a farmer showed up with a shotgun at the Federal Reserve to kill Paul Volcker for raising rates. So like I said, that's not an invitation for any action. But it was a tough time. And then in 1984, President Reagan won reelection with 49 states. I think they may have even let Mondale win Minnesota just so it wasn’t a skunk. Just to be nice. Yeah. And that's what President Trump is doing now. For years, the American worker—the middle class—has been eviscerated. American workers have taken it on the chin. And, you know, we're just starting to see some of the research now—like we're seeing research on what's called the China Shock from 2004. It’s just coming out now. And it's what you know. It's what I know. But finally, academics are saying, “Oh gosh, the American workers never recovered from the China Shock. What a surprise.” President Trump sensed it 40 years ago. But out on the campaign trail—starting in 2015 up until last year—he has promised the American workers that the old standard of living can come back. Because what we've seen over the past at least 20 years since the China Shock—but more like the past 30—are these massive distributional problems, where the coasts have done great, yes, and the middle of the country has just seen quality of life, life expectancy, decline. They don't think their children are going to do better than they are. And a lot of people don't care. And President Trump cares. This administration cares. And this is the first step towards realigning that. A lot of our trading partners, including some of our allies, have not been good partners. If tariffs are so bad, why do they have them? Quick question. Why do they have them, right? Or if the American consumer is going to pay all the tariff, then why do they care about the tariff? Right? Because they're going to eat them. So I think that this is the beginning of a process. We're going to reindustrialize. We've gone to a highly financialized economy. We've stopped making things—especially a lot of things that are relevant for national security. I think one of the few good outcomes from COVID was we had a beta test for what maybe a kinetic war with a large adversary could look like. And it turned out that these highly efficient supply chains were not strategically secure. So we don't make our own medicines. We don't make our own semiconductors. We don't make our own ships anymore. So I think if I were to say, “Was there any good outcome from COVID?” it was—it woke the world up to these supply chain problems. So economic security is national security. President Trump and I have talked about that a lot. Okay, so this is a national security issue that we're seeing here. But it's also an economic security issue. And it's to—I don't want to say redistribute—but it is to give working Americans real wage gains and enhance their lives. And I've said out on the campaign trail—one of my most frequent mottos was: Wall Street’s done great. It can continue doing well. But it's Main Street’s turn. It's Main Street’s turn. And that's what we saw yesterday: it's Main Street’s turn.\nCarlson: So over the course of my life—55 years—Wall Street really has been the commonly recognized measure of economic health. Like, how’s the Dow doing? We’ve got entire TV channels devoted to tracking its progress, which has mostly been up during the course of my life. So if the average of the equity averages falls—if the stock market falls—that’s seen by a lot of people as a measure that the economy itself is in decline. Do you think that’s a fair measure?\nSec. Bessent: Look, the market goes up and down. Warren Buffett has a saying: in the short run, the market’s a voting machine; in the long run, it’s a weighing machine. And in the long run, it’s going to weigh: do we have good policies? Yes. And I—in my former business—I commented on market structure, market ups and downs a lot. I'm trying not to do that now. Yes. But for everyone who thinks that these market declines are all based on the President’s economic policies, I can tell you: this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek. So the so-called \"Mag Seven\"—the tech stocks—have been doing very well for about 18 months. They led the market. And I think there was kind of a real dose of reality in what was going on in AI. And I think the U.S. is going to remain the leader in AI. But the AI-related stocks started coming down. So, like, if I were to analyze this in my old hat—and this is the only time I’m going to talk about my old hat—what’s happening with the market? I’d say it’s more of a “Mag Seven” problem, not a “Magnet” problem, right?\nCarlson: So it's deeper. So actually, the markets are—you’re saying in this specific case, with tech stocks—taking a real measure of the value of companies relative to foreign companies?\nSec. Bessent: Well, it’s that. But if we look at the equal-weighted S&P—even after today’s moves—it’s down 4% on the year. On a long-term chart, you wouldn’t even notice that. Yeah. And I think the most important thing that we can do—that I can do as Treasury Secretary, and that President Trump wants to do—is put in sound fundamentals for the underlying economy. And if the underlying economy is good—if taxes are stable, businesses have predictability, we have cheap and plentiful energy, if we deregulate, if we treat our workforce well—then we're going to have a great stock market.\nCarlson: Fair. The President suggested, in describing his plan for tariffs—he said, \"Look, you could conceivably fund a lot of government with tariffs,\" and that would suggest that taxpayers fund less of the burden. So do you expect that these will be accompanied by a congressionally approved tax cut for the middle class?\nSec. Bessent: I just want to go back for a moment to that—one of the things that the tariffs are doing is we are pushing back against other economic systems. So the Chinese have a very different economic system. They have low costs—some would call it literally slave labor. They subsidize industry with subsidized loans. They have a lot of non-tariff barriers. Your show can’t be shown there. Yes. So, we’re pushing back against that. And with the tariff income—it can be substantial. And if we think like a classical model of tariff income: let’s say there's a 10% tariff. Then the currency would appreciate about 40% of that—so 4%. Then the producer in the other country would eat about 4%, and then the U.S. consumer might have a one-time price adjustment of 2%. So in a 10% tariff, maybe the consumer pays 2%. We saw a study out recently—from a group at MIT—that shows with President Trump’s first China tariffs, which were approximately 20%, the price level went up 0.7%. So to answer your question: if we could put on a 20% tariff, have the foreigners pay that, and use that money to bring down our government deficit and keep taxes low? That’s a very unique formula that hasn’t been tried in this country for a long time.\nCarlson: Do you think—but it would require congressional participation to get there, right? To move tax rates? Of course, those are set by the Congress.\nSec. Bessent: Well, what we're going to have now—we are in this very odd, what I would call “betwixt and between”—between the tariff income and what DOGE is doing in terms of cutting government expenses. So, CBO scoring—and for 35 years I was on the other side of the wall, and I would always say, “Oh, well, CBO says this”—I didn’t really realize that CBO scoring is a lot like Enron accounting. It’s not real. And when you actually look at the rules…\nCarlson: But you assumed it was real on the outside—sure, “Well, they’re experts.” Congressional Budget Office.\nSec. Bessent: It's the Congressional Budget Office, and they're well-intentioned people. They just have nonsensical rules. Think about this: when all the scoring is done over a 10-year window, they just assume 1.7 or 1.8% economic growth over the 10 years—and that never moves. Whether you raise taxes or cut taxes—it doesn’t move. So that’s why, like during the campaign, when Vice President Harris was announcing all these big tax increases she wanted to do and things like that, the CBO was scoring her very well. And President Trump wants to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent—that was kind of a blowout number. Because obviously, growth is going to go up a lot when you cut taxes. So, that was a long way of saying: we will not get credit for the tariffs in any bill, because Congress is not going to legislate it. The President’s doing it with executive authority. But the money will be coming in. We’ve already taken in several hundred million dollars on the China tariffs from his first term. We’ve taken in about $35 billion a year just on the old tariffs—not the new ones. So in the CBO window, that’s about $350 billion, which pays for a lot of the President's promises: no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, making interest deductibility available on autos made in the U.S. And think what the President is doing here: he is backing into an affordability solution for the bottom 50% of wage earners. Because they are the ones who will benefit from all four of those programs.\nCarlson: So looking at, say, a year from now—so next, beginning of next April—do you have any sense of how much the U.S. government anticipates bringing in from the tariffs announced yesterday?\nSec. Bessent: It's going to be a moving target, sure. But could it be anywhere from $300 billion to $600 billion a year? Sure.\nCarlson: That's—that's meaningful revenue.\nSec. Bessent: Very meaningful. But what will happen with tariffs over time—the ultimate goal of the tariffs, and the President says it all the time: bring your factory here. That’s the best solution for getting away from a tariff wall. So move your factory from China, from Mexico, from Vietnam—bring it here. What will happen over time is: we’ll have substantial tariff income in the beginning. Manufacturers will build their factories here. The tariffs will drop. But the revenue from the factories—from income taxes, from all the new jobs—will go up. So we’ll be taking it in domestically as the tariffs drop. And why are the tariffs dropping? Because we’re making it here. And our trade deficits are dropping.\nCarlson: So you’ve obviously thought this through. Do you think the United States has the necessary labor force for this transition?\nSec. Bessent: I think we do. I think with AI, with automation, with so many of these factories going to be new—they’re going to be smart factories—I think we’ve got all the labor force we need. And what we're doing on the other side—one of the reasons, other than my support for President Trump, that I came out from behind my desk—I had a pretty good life—and I wanted to come out and really tell people that I was worried about an impending financial calamity, given the high levels of government spending that were leading to high levels of government debt. So what we are doing: on one side, the President is reordering trade. On the other side, we are shedding excess labor in the federal government and bringing down federal borrowings. And then on the other side of that, we will have the labor we need for new manufacturing. We’re going to re-lever the private sector. So the private sector, in essence, has been in recession during the Biden years. This is an opportunity to right-size the federal government and unleash the private sector again, because it's been hemmed down by excessive regulation and it's been crowded out by the government.\nCarlson: Here’s a fact of life you may not learn till you're older, but I'm going to tell you now: it’s very hard to have a good time if you're wearing bad boots. In fact, it may be impossible, and that's why you need Tecovas. As a matter of fact, you don't just need them—you owe them to yourself. So let me ask you—since your job is, in part, to forecast the effects of these policies—do you ever think: we’ve got probably one out of six people in this country here illegally, maybe 50 million illegal aliens, and the President says he wants to deport them. Then you have AI, and the projections there are massive labor market disruption—fewer people needed, you alluded to that a minute ago. Then you have the tariffs. And we can guess at their effect, but we don’t really know, because we’ve never done it. And then you have the reaction from the rest of the world to those tariffs. There are so many huge factors that are effectively unknown—that are black boxes. Do you ever think, “Wow, it’s kind of hard to know what’s going to happen”?\nSec. Bessent: Look, it is. And I always think—you can never be 100% sure. But you can stay within some guardrails and keep moving forward. I can’t remember which Sunday morning show I was on a few weeks ago, but the commentator asked me, “Can you guarantee me there won’t be a recession?” And I said, “I can’t guarantee you anything. There’s nothing that tells me there should be one.” So I believe this is going to work, just like President Reagan believed supply-side economics was going to work. What I do know is that the old system wasn’t working. I think that’s right. And if you look at a system that’s not working, you’ve got to be brave to change it. So what wasn’t working? Would it have been really fun for me to come in and just keep issuing a lot of debt? It's almost like a bodybuilder taking steroids—outside, looks great, muscular. Inside, you’re killing your vital organs. That’s what was going on here. It would’ve been easy to keep pumping up the economy, borrowing a lot of money, creating a lot of government jobs—there’s no controversy when you're doing all that. But you were going to end up in a calamity. Go back and look at the financial crisis in ’07–’08. The economy looked great right up until it didn’t. Look at the end of the dot-com bubble, then the whole credit problem, the fraud at WorldCom, Enron—some other companies. The economy looked great... until it didn’t. And I think one of the things we won’t get credit for—but that this administration will have done—is avoiding a financial calamity. Think about it: there’s an analysis that one of the reasons 9/11 happened was because the airlines didn’t want to pay for reinforced cockpit doors. They kept pushing back, FAA didn’t push hard enough. Well now we’ve got the reinforced doors. So I look at it this way: we’re putting on the reinforced doors before the crash.\nCarlson: What’s the lobbying scramble by foreign governments going to be like over the next three months? Because the President said yesterday, “I’m putting a universal tariff,”—you know, one standard. But then of course, each country is adjusted according to a lot of different factors: trade deficit, currency manipulation, regulation, tariffs. But this is all, as you said, a moving picture. So like—if I’m a country like Vietnam, or China—I mean, I’m going to try really hard to bring pressure to bear on this administration to adjust those numbers. What’s that going to be like?\nSec. Bessent: It’s going to be the President’s decision. And I think his view is: this has been going on for a long time—for friends and foes—and we’re going to see where this plays out. I think what’s going to be more important than the discussions with countries is the discussions with companies. What do companies want to do? As President Trump said yesterday, the best way to get around the tariff is: build your factory here. And what can we do here at Treasury to help that? We’re pushing to get the tax bill done so we can guarantee the low taxes, full depreciation within the first year. We’re working with Secretaries Burgum and Wright on energy security. We’re working on getting the regulations down. The President—I don’t know whether he talked about it yesterday or the day before—but Taiwan Semi, the biggest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, needs permits. Lee Zeldin, the EPA commissioner, is working to push through all the permits they need. Because we’ve just gone into this regulatory morass where it takes so long to get things done in this country. So I think what will be more interesting are the individual company announcements—more than the country announcements.\nCarlson: You want to sell to Americans? You’ve got to make it in America. Sure. Or pay the tariff. So how is China, as a nation, going to respond? I mean, this is such a big challenge—it’s directly in their face. It's about every country on the globe, but it's really, more than any other country, about China. I think that's fair to say. How are they going to respond? What's the retaliation look like?\nSec. Bessent: Well, I don’t know if they can retaliate—for a couple of reasons. If you look at the history—and I used to teach economic history—when you look at it, we are the debtor nation. Yes, we have the trade deficits. The surplus nation is in the weaker position. Because the Chinese business model—and by the way, the Chinese business model and economy are the most imbalanced in the history of the modern world. We’ve never seen anything like this in terms of their export level relative to GDP, relative to population. So I think it is going to be very difficult for them to try to change the model. They’re trying. They’re in a deflationary recession—slash depression—right now. They’re trying to export their way out of it. And we can’t let them do that. But when you think about it, the Chinese manufacturing system is like that old Disney movie with the brooms carrying the buckets. There’s nothing you can do—it just keeps going. That’s their business model. It’s not going to stop. Now, what could happen—if you were to say, “Scott, what’s the dream scenario?”—it’s that somehow there could be a deal where the U.S. and China… We want more manufacturing, which would mean a smaller part of the economy is consumption. The Chinese have this imbalanced economy with too much manufacturing. And actually, Chinese consumers really get the short end of the stick. Chinese households—they’re caught in what’s called the middle-income trap. Could we do something together where they rebalance—consume more, manufacture less? We consume less, manufacture more? We’ll still be military rivals. There’ll still be economic rivalry. But we’d level the playing field by a lot. Now, that’s not going to happen tomorrow. That’s not going to happen in a month. But over the next few years, they may have to come around. Because I think their business model is broken. I think President Trump has broken their business model with these tariffs.\nCarlson: So you’re describing, you know, the famous scenario where—if you take out a bank loan, the bank is in charge. But if you take a big enough loan, you’re kind of in charge of the bank.\nSec. Bessent: Exactly. And they’ve just got such a big deficit with us that they need our markets. They can’t survive without them.\nCarlson: Are you confident that there’s a clear enough channel of communication between the two governments—that the details can be worked out and nothing will go crazy in the meantime?\nSec. Bessent: I think what gives me a lot of confidence is the relationship between President Trump and Chairman Xi. When you have a direct line of communication at the very top, then I think it’s very difficult for things to go haywire.\nCarlson: What about the rest of the world? What about Europe?\nSec. Bessent: Look, the Europeans—go back to that famous meeting where President Trump told the Europeans: “You’re insane for building Nord Stream 2. What are you doing? You already get most of your energy from Russia and you’re going to double down on it?” And they did. And look what happened.\nCarlson: So we blew it up.\nSec. Bessent: Putin. Some Norwegian fisherman bumped into it is what I read. But the Europeans go kicking and screaming—but I think they’re going to have to rebalance too. Germany has a very imbalanced export economy. They were on the verge of deindustrialization. They were the opposite of us: they had expensive energy, they were depending on Italy and the countries in the south to keep the euro suppressed, and they were selling into China. Now China is becoming their competitor.\nCarlson: So you said at the outset—the first example, the analogy you used—was President Reagan’s first term. Big win in ’80, recession in ’82, wipeout, and then the biggest landslide in history in ’84. So you’re suggesting, by saying that, that the fruits were obvious within the first term—within four years?\nSec. Bessent: They were. Only difference now is, there was a lot of competition back then—but there was a level of civility. The real danger here—if there were a midterm loss, and I don’t think there has to be—you know what’s going to happen. I know what’s going to happen. Democratic House is going immediately to impeachment for something, of course. The lawfare is going to start again. And I think the American people are going to hate it—again. Einstein’s definition of insanity: doing the same thing again and expecting a different result.\nCarlson: Do you think that—and this is really aimed at the people who support President Trump and who agree with you wholeheartedly that the current system was really bad. And, like, drive across the country, you’ll see how bad it has been—horrible. It lowered life expectancy. But the people who are hoping that yesterday’s move will lead to a demonstrably brighter future within four years— Is it your sincere prediction that within four years, we’ll say, “Actually, that kind of worked”?\nSec. Bessent: I believe that it’s going to work. And I know that what we were doing wasn’t working. Yes. So I think we have to try this. And I have a high confidence ratio it’s going to work. And I have a very high confidence ratio… The good news is, we have President Trump’s previous term, when everyone said none of this was going to work: “Oh, the China tariffs are going to do this. They’re going to cause inflation.” They didn’t. “This is going to hurt working-class Americans.” Well, guess what? Working-class Americans—hourly workers—did better than supervisory workers. The bottom 50% of households—their net worth increased faster than the top 10% of households. I’m not happy with what’s going on in the market today, but the distribution of equities across households? The top 10% of Americans own 88% of equities. Eighty-eight percent of the stock market. The next 40% owns 12%. The bottom 50% has debt. They have credit card bills. They rent their homes. They have auto loans. And we’ve got to give them some relief.\nCarlson: That’s the message right there. Just as a bystander, I’m like, “Wow. Okay. All right. Heard that.”\nSec. Bessent: I like the examples. And I was really struck by two different statistics last year—summer of 2024: Americans took more European vacations than they had in history. Summer of 2024—more Americans were using food banks than they ever have in history. I went into two food banks near my hometown to ask, “What’s the story?” And they said, “You know, for a lot of people, it really takes a loss of dignity to walk into a food bank.” Of course. But they were seeing a new phenomenon: it wasn’t their traditional clientele. It wasn’t people who lost their homes. It wasn’t people out on the street. These were working families who could no longer afford $100 at the grocery store. That basket of groceries every week—they were missing five, six, seven things. And they were coming to the food bank to top up. So that’s not a great America. Record European vacations. Record food bank usage. No reason we can’t keep the record European vacations going—but we’ve got to take care of these other people. And you know what? They don’t want handouts. The Democrats had this strategy called “compensate the loser.” First of all, the name of that strategy? I don’t think the bottom 50% of Americans are losers. I think the system hasn’t worked for them. I think they are winners—it’s just a bad system. So we are going to fix the system. And look—they want good jobs. They want their kids to do better than they do. They want to own a home. They want to pay down their debt. This isn’t hard. And I think we can do this in the next four years.\nCarlson: It used to be only crazy people thought they were being watched all the time—surveilled—the guy mumbling next to you on the bus. But now, anyone who knows what’s going on thinks that, because it’s true. Your phones are listening to you. Tech companies are tracking all your online activity in order to profit off what ought to be private information. Governments are watching too. It’s a corrupt system. It’s frightening. And the worst part is—it’s all legal. Government certainly will not help stop this. Of course, the intel agencies love it. So it’s up to you to protect yourself. And that’s where ExpressVPN comes in. So—you grew up in a middle-class, working-class background. You were very successful. Lived in rich-person world for a long time while this was all going on. And I just have to ask you candidly: were you ever at dinner with people who were like, “Wow, we’re doing great”? I live in rich-person world too. I’m not criticizing you at all. But did anyone at dinner ever say, “Wow, I just drove 100 miles—this country doesn’t look good. People are not thriving.” Was there any sense of that among the people you knew?\nSec. Bessent: No. They were more like, “My NetJets was an hour late. I had the worst day. I’m switching charter companies.” Look, Tucker, I’m especially attuned to what I think is going on with the United States because—I’ll tell you, my family was very affluent. Early settlers. We were very affluent for about 250 years. My dad made a lot of bad financial choices. So when I was born—the first six, seven, eight years—we were affluent. He lost everything. So I’ve seen what that’s like. I’ve seen both sides. I was fortunate enough to be able to make it back. I know what economic insecurity is like. And I don’t think people should have to have that. If you want to work hard—and people want to work hard—you were out on the campaign trail with President Trump. I was out on the campaign trail. And I’ve got to say—one of the most moving things for me was at the final two stops: Pittsburgh and Grand Rapids, Michigan. In Pittsburgh—in the Duquesne arena—I walk in, and there are the union workers. The steel workers. They’ve got on their hats. They’ve got on their vests. They’re there with their children. It was very moving. They just want a better life. They want their communities to be sound. They want their kids to do better. They want Little League baseball. They don’t care what’s going on on Madison Avenue. They don’t know what the hot new restaurant is in Paris. And President Trump has somehow assembled this incredible coalition—Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, the folks who were in the Rose Garden yesterday, and the people I saw at the Duquesne arena. I think it’s unbelievable.\nCarlson: Interesting. What do you worry about as Treasury Secretary? I mean, obviously—probably lying in bed at night, thinking about all the things that could go wrong with the U.S. economy. What are your—if you could be honest—what are your biggest worries?\nSec. Bessent: So, to the extent that in my business career I had a strong point, I think it was risk management. I view myself as the United States’ leading bond salesman. Yep. And I think that with what’s going on, I’m going to have a better and better story to tell as we get our economic health and fiscal house in order. Then I try to imagine what could go very wrong. What would we do if there were another outbreak similar to COVID? You can’t worry about things like that—but I worry about a kinetic war somewhere. What would we do in the event of something happening? What I try to do is create the situation where I can worry a little less every day. So I’ll tell you: I came in—I was confirmed on January 28—and during the month of January, 10-year interest rates—which is probably the most important rate in the country, since mortgages and capital formation are based on it—had almost spiked to 5%. And I think 5% can be an uncomfortable area for the economy, for Treasury, for issuing bonds. Now that I’ve gotten in, I worry a little less. But I still worry. We’ve got a tremendous amount of debt to roll. And I worry that we won’t do the smart cuts and focus on waste, fraud, and abuse. I worry that that gets sidelined. Then on the other side, I worry that the tax bill somehow gets bogged down. We could have the largest tax increase in history. Or I worry about the usual geopolitical things—whether it’s Iran, Taiwan—that something goes haywire between Russia and Ukraine.\nCarlson: So you began your job description by saying you’re a bond salesman. You’re selling America’s debt to the world. And I know that was a big part of the portfolio as the transition was envisioning it—“Who can make the case for American bonds to the world?” How is your case? Are you confident you can do that? And how is your pitch changing after yesterday?\nSec. Bessent: Right now we’re in this strange “betwixt and between,” because we’re going to take in substantial tariff revenue. And what DOGE is doing is substantially cutting expenses. But we’re not getting credit for it right now. I think the market’s starting to get a hint of it. The 10-year bond, which had almost peaked at 5%, is now through 4%. A way to think about it is: every 100 basis points is about $1 trillion in savings. So we’ve saved $100 billion. That’s probably not going to happen that quickly again. But I think we are setting the sails for a much better fiscal time. People don’t have to say, “The U.S. is out of control. The U.S. is going to default.” We’re not. And I think every day, my case gets better.\nSec. Bessent: And like, if we were to just imagine a very reductionist formula for government—G equals S minus T—government spending minus taxes. For “spending,” our side—the Republicans—likes to spend, but less than the Democrats. But both sides like to spend. Then you have “minus T”—taxes. Democrats like higher taxes. We like lower taxes. What if the “S” actually went down? To me, that’s the exciting part. That’s been unthinkable in everybody’s calculation.\nCarlson: No one’s even seriously raised it—including Ronald Reagan, by the way.\nSec. Bessent: Right. And look, I think President Reagan had a different agenda. He ramped up defense spending. And remember—“Oh, he’s crazy. It’s going to break the budget. Star Wars is crazy. He’s a madman.” And then the Iron Curtain went down. So it’s actually a Soviet term. He used the Soviet strategy on themselves—on the Russians. Escalate to de-escalate. We escalated military spending. They tried to keep up. And then they collapsed. Everything’s easy in hindsight. But I think here, what we’re doing—bringing down these incredible levels of spending—but more importantly… I tell anyone who will listen: DOGE is the Office of Government Efficiency. Not Elimination. Not Extinction. So what if we can actually do a better job with less? Seems inconceivable—but when I see what’s going on in a lot of these government agencies, it’s unbelievable. Like, I’ve lived in Manhattan, I’ve lived in Florida. Roughly, the state of New York and the state of Florida have the same number of people. Actually, Florida has a few more now. New York’s budget is about $235 billion. Florida’s is $125 billion. How do they do that? Oh yeah—and there’s no income tax in Florida. Oh yeah—and the roads are better. You go to get your driver’s license—it takes 15 minutes, not five hours. So can we make the rest of America look more like Florida—and less like New York?\nOr one day, is New York going to look more like Florida?\nCarlson: So do you think after four years, we will see an actual net reduction in government spending—thanks to DOGE?\nSec. Bessent: Inflation-adjusted? Yes.\nCarlson: How long do you think Elon is in for?\nSec. Bessent: Day to day? I don’t know. But I think his imprint is going to be with us a long time. And I think the mainstream media has tried to demonize DOGE and all the folks who work with him. And we’ve got a couple of Treasury—a couple of IRS—employees who I hired, who I interviewed. I’ll tell you—there’s one fellow, Tom Kraus. He was on TV with Bret Baier the other night. Tom’s incredible. He’s done $100 billion of tech mergers. With my investment business, I would’ve hired him. I don’t think I could have afforded him. He is doing this for the good of his country. He came in without touching any of the payment systems—contrary to what the Washington Post falsely reported. He analyzed the system, and within six weeks, pointed at all the vulnerabilities. There’s a young man named Sam Kirkos, who was on Laura Ingraham with me the other night. That was my idea—bring him out of the shadows. Let’s make this demonization stop. This young man—other than the fact that he only owns one pair of pants, which he likes telling everyone—I’d be happy if our daughter brought him home. He’s a patriot. He’s working hard for the country. He’s analytical. And the things he’s seen at the IRS—just in their tech systems—and that’s all he does. You know, Elon has a shirt that he wears under his jacket. He flashes it every once in a while. It says “Tech Support.” That’s what we’re getting. We’ve got a Blockbuster-style government in a Netflix world. We’re hailing cabs in an Uber economy. Why can’t the government be in the gig economy? Not hard.\nCarlson: We’re not positive that cryptocurrency is the future of finance—but we do know that what we have now is broken and dangerous. Can I ask you a weird question? Who runs the Federal Reserve, exactly? How can you have this pivotal institution that has the most direct effect on markets—but it seems outside of political control?\nSec. Bessent: Well, look—I was at a dinner Jerome Powell attended last night. During my confirmation hearing, I said: I’m only going to talk about the mistakes the Fed has made in the past. I won’t talk about the ones they’re going to make in the future. But I think it is important that monetary policy be walled off. Some of the other things they’ve done—like DEI, like climate—they impinge on their monetary credibility. I think the Fed should focus on monetary policy—doing the best they can for the American economy, the American people. Keeping inflation low. There are a lot of other banking agencies to do the rest.\nCarlson: The Fed controls the weather now too. What were they doing with climate?\nSec. Bessent: Well, Treasury chairs something called the Financial Stability Oversight Council. It’s all the financial regulators. Two weeks before Silicon Valley Bank went under, FSOC issued a report. They said the biggest risk to the financial system was climate. Really? Not that a large bank in California was having a slow-motion run on its assets? They failed. The regulators failed. People are getting sick of that. And it goes back to one of my favorite Trump phrases: common sense. It’s just common sense. If your deposits can leave with a click—you shouldn’t have all these long-term assets. But the regulators were too busy worrying about the weather. And there was also some degree of regulatory capture. The CEO of Silicon Valley Bank was on the board of the San Francisco Fed—his chief regulator. They’re going to tell that guy what to do.\nCarlson: Why is gold moving around the world in such huge quantities right now?\nSec. Bessent: A couple of reasons. It’s moving physically. Uncertainty about whether gold would be exempt from tariffs. I believe we have exempted it. But there was a big move out of vaults in Switzerland and London to get it into New York. Gold has always been a store of value. We’re seeing huge demand from China. They're in an economic recession or depression. Their people don’t trust the yuan. There are capital controls. 1.4 billion people want to get their money out—and they can’t. But they can buy gold.\nCarlson: Do you find it interesting that even now—in 2025—when everything is abstract and digital, gold is still believed to be reliable?\nSec. Bessent: Gold has history going for it. A friend of mine’s grandmother, during Russia’s financial crisis in ’98, bought 18 bicycles. That was her store of value.\nCarlson: How’d she do on the bike investment?\nSec. Bessent: Great. I wish I’d done that well. Gold can’t run a deficit. It can’t default. It can’t go to war. It’s isolated from government failure. That’s why people trust it.\nCarlson: So you’re not anti-gold?\nSec. Bessent: Oh no. When I had my fund, people would’ve called me a gold bug.\nCarlson: How did you wind up interacting with Zelensky?\nSec. Bessent: The President asked me to go to Kyiv. He actually asked me to lead the economic agreement that was part of his peace plan. It’s important to understand the arc of President Trump’s peace plan. He sequenced it well:\n- Sign a deal with the Ukrainians to link the U.S. and Ukraine closer together.\n- Signal to Russian leadership that we’re not abandoning Ukraine.\n- Show the American people that we have an economic stake in Ukraine—this isn’t just about massive grants.\nSo if Ukraine succeeds, we succeed. It could be a long-term partnership. I thought it was important to take the agreement to Kyiv and present it to President Zelensky. Everyone was telling me, “Oh no, meet him in Vienna. He’ll be at the Munich Security Conference.” I said no—I want to go there and discuss it with him. So that’s how I ended up in Kyiv. Very interesting trip: fly to Poland, then get on this 10-hour night train and arrive in Kyiv at 8:30 in the morning. And for everyone who said, “President Trump is selling out to the Russians”—he’s not. The Russians bombed Kyiv four hours before I got there. They hadn’t bombed since November. They didn’t like the look of this deal—it was durable for both the American and Ukrainian people. President Zelensky was in the mood to sign the deal that day. We had a spirited discussion. I said, “You’ve got 50 reporters out there. I’m here to show there’s no daylight between our two peoples, our two governments. You’ve opened up daylight the size of the Grand Canyon.” He said, “Tell them I’m going to sign the deal in Munich.” I said, “So when you see Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Rubio, you’ll sign it?” “Yes.” He didn’t sign it there. Then the following week, his team begged to come to the White House. We said: sign the deal first. He got to the Oval Office and blew up what should have been the easiest thing to do in the world. He was supposed to show up, have a press conference, then we’d have a private lunch. If he had anything to air, that was the time. There’s a famous photo in the East Room—everything laid out, ready to be signed. It never got signed.\nCarlson: So this is an unelected president of a client state, whose bureaucrats are being paid directly by American taxpayers—including retirement accounts?\nSec. Bessent: Yes. And they have the lowest retirement age in Europe—60. France is 62. Italy is 67. We’re paying for that.\nCarlson: And yet—this man is in a precarious position—and he acts high-handed, sniffs a lot, berates American officials. How do you account for that arrogance?\nSec. Bessent: Well, a couple things. He was a performer—a vaudevillian. An ordinary person thrown into a fraught time. He rose to the occasion. He was heroic. But now he’s stuck. Some in his cabinet are good. Some of the people around him—not so much. He’s not getting the best advice. And here’s the thing: the agreement made sure the money came to the American people and the Ukrainian people. Let me tell you what it wasn’t:\n–It wasn’t one of these rapacious Chinese deals—“Sign over your mine, your port…”\n– It wasn’t a loan-to-own scheme—“Here’s a loan you’ll never pay back so we take your asset.” It was a real economic partnership. They put in assets. We put in loans through our development banks. We put in American know-how. We don’t make any money unless they make money. You know who didn’t like that? People with their hands in the till. Because we were regulating the flow of money. That’s part of the glitch. I’m hopeful that it was a bug, not a feature. We’re expecting a Ukrainian technical team next week. I’m hopeful we can get it signed and return to a win-win. President Trump’s plan was: Sign with Ukraine. Show Russia we stand with Ukraine economically. Bring Russia to the table. The sequencing’s been thrown off—but I think we can fix it.\nCarlson: Are we ever going to get an audit of where all of our billions went? The weapons? The cash? The pallets of $100 bills? Why is that so hard?\nSec. Bessent: I don’t know. I always try to look forward. If this deal works, that money could end up being small change. Think about this: in 1991, when the Iron Curtain fell, Poland and Ukraine had economies of similar size. Today, Poland’s economy is 3.5x or 4x bigger—and growing. Ukraine? Held back by kleptocracy. With U.S. assistance and a Trump-brokered peace, the Ukrainian people could finally move forward.\nCarlson: For a Treasury Secretary, you're a very capable diplomat, I must say—very diplomatic language. Last question: because this is all so new—just going back to the tariff announcement—how do you keep message discipline in the administration? Who decides how to explain this? How do you keep everyone on the same page?\nSec. Bessent: We all take President Trump’s lead. We had a meeting yesterday morning. Then a meeting after the Rose Garden announcement before we went out on media. He’s his own best spokesman. No one does it better. Then we fan out—and we are all unified behind his vision. That’s why we’re here. If you don’t want to be part of it—you shouldn’t be here.\nCarlson: Do you ever say, “Hey, this person reassures markets; that person scares them—let’s send the right person out?”\nSec. Bessent: The one thing I’ll say: no one should listen to anyone in the markets talk about the U.S. dollar other than President Trump or myself. We’re the only ones who speak for this administration on dollar policy. We have a strong dollar policy. And we’re putting in all the ingredients to make sure the dollar is strong over the long run. Can it go up and down in the short run? Sure. Can there be bilateral moves between the dollar and other currencies? Sure—that’s what I made a living doing. But over time, if we put in sound fundamentals and follow through on this transformation, the dollar will do great—and so will the American people.\nCarlson: Secretary, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR.\nToday’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy.\nWe are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards.\nSo, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it.\nI thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production?\nKISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you.\nSo, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world.\nAnd it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize.\nSo, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds.\nFASKIANOS: Fantastic.\nI thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic.\nKISSANE: Sure.\nSo, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil.\nYou know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day.\nSo, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand.\nAnd you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation.\nSo, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers.\nAnd again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision.\nNow, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+.\nAnd these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves.\nAnd then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand.\nBut again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies.\nAnd so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas.\nAnd then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand.\nAnd I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil.\nAnd again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day.\nAnd then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies.\nBut again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil.\nAnd again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less.\nSo, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great.\nSo now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments.\n(Gives queuing instructions.)\nAll right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself.\n(Pause.)\nYou are still muted.\n(Pause.)\nOK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK.\nLet’s go to Morton Holbrook.\nQ: Yes, good afternoon.\nDr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market?\nThank you.\nKISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question.\nYeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency.\nSo, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil.\nI think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system.\nOne of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten.\nSo, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand.\nNow, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil.\nAnd I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil.\nSo, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles.\nBut there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia?\nKISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one.\nSo, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done.\nAnd again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil.\nSo, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted.\nSo, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting.\nBut I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship.\nThat’s a great question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.\nQ: Hello?\nFASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open.\nQ: Can you hear me now?\nFASKIANOS: Yes.\nQ: That’s better. OK.\nFASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much.\nQ: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is.\nQ: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn.\nMy question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund?\nAnd thank you to Mrs. Irina.\nKISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar.\nSo, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question.\nQ: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund?\nKISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question.\nYou know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well.\nYou know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world.\nSo, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil.\nBut I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean.\nBut again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil.\nAnd you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR.\nBut thank you for the question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil?\nKISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question.\nSo, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located?\nSo you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity.\nYou know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States.\nSo, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy?\nKISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much.\nYeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron.\nBut I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential.\nSo, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue.\nAnd another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself.\nQ: Can you hear me, please?\nFASKIANOS: Yes, we can.\nQ: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University.\nAnd my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent?\nKISSANE: Thank you.\nQ: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that.\nKISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question.\nYeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure.\nI think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based.\nAnd that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal.\nAnd I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important.\nAnd again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa.\nSo again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach.\nSo, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that.\nKISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question.\nYeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent.\nSo, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies.\nAnd so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition.\nSo, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition.\nSo, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change.\nSo you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami.\nQ: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program.\nJust to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries?\nFASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct?\nQ: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nKISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second?\nCan I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but—\nQ: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)?\nKISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries.\nYou know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there.\nSomeone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it.\nI think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward.\nFASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this?\nKISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made.\nYou know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil.\nAnd one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia.\nAnd we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to.\nAnd again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions.\nAnd you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it.\nA really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel.\nSo, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy?\nKISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference.\nYeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open.\nSo, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system.\nSweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero.\nWe also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy.\nSo, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear.\nSo, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system.\nFASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all.\nSo, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina.\nSo, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy?\nKISSANE: Great question.\nI think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play.\nI think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe.\nThat said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition.\nFASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for?\nKISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like.\nI think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical.\nSo, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex.\nSo, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.\nFASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments. I’m really sorry that we could not get to them all. But we only have an hour.

Bye.\n(END)\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Can Donald Trump Eliminate the Debt?\nIn discussing another potential term in office, last month, former President Donald Trump declared, \"we’re going to pay off our debt.” President Trump similarly promised to pay off the national debt within eight years during his 2016 presidential campaign.1\nAlthough it is impossible to know the future, this claim is almost certainly false. Absent massive revenue increases – which President Trump has never mentioned – it would be literally impossible to pay off the national debt over the four years of the next presidential term, and practically impossible to pay it off over the ten-year budget window.\nOver four years, even eliminating all spending would not be enough to pay off the debt, nor would doubling revenue collection. Over ten years, paying off the debt would require cutting all federal spending by about 60 percent or boosting revenue by two-thirds. Assuming Social Security, Medicare, and defense spending are exempt from cuts – consistent with President Trump’s rhetoric – even eliminating all remaining spending would not pay off the debt without trillions of additional revenues.\n| US Budget Watch 2024 is a project of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget designed to educate the public on the fiscal impact of presidential candidates’ proposals and platforms. Through the election, we will issue policy explainers, fact checks, budget scores, and other analyses. We do not support or oppose any candidate for public office. |\nHow Much Savings Would be Needed to Pay Off the Debt?\nAt the beginning of the next presidential term, debt held by the public is likely to total around $28.5 trillion. It is projected to grow by an additional $7 trillion over the next presidential term and by $22.5 trillion through the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2035.\nThis means paying off the debt over four years would require generating about $35.5 trillion of budget and interest savings – covering the $28.5 trillion of initial debt and preventing the accumulation of $7 trillion of further debt. To achieve this, policymakers would need to turn $1.7 trillion average annual deficits into $7.1 trillion annual surpluses.\nOver the ten-year budget window starting in the next presidential term, spanning from FY 2026 through FY 2035, policymakers would need to achieve $51 trillion of budget and interest savings – enough to cover the $28.5 trillion of initial debt and prevent $22.5 trillion in debt accumulation. This would mean turning $2.1 trillion average annual deficits into $3 trillion annual surpluses.\nCan the Debt be Paid Off Within the Next Presidential Term?\nIt would be literally impossible to pay off the debt by the end of the next presidential term without large accompanying tax increases, and likely impossible with them. While the needed savings would equal $35.5 trillion, total spending is projected to be $29 trillion over that four-year period – of which $4 trillion is interest and cannot be cut directly. We estimate it would require the equivalent of cutting all non-interest spending by about 130 percent, which is of course impossible. (Even under a rosy scenario that assumes much faster economic growth and substantial new tariff revenue, cuts would be nearly as large).\nIt is also likely impossible to achieve these savings on the tax side. With total revenue expected to come in at $22 trillion over the next presidential term, revenue collection would have to be nearly 250 percent of current projections to pay off the national debt. It’s not clear that this level of revenue collection is even possible without being above revenue-maximizing tax rates, and it is certainly not consistent with President Trump’s calls to lower taxes.\nCan the Debt be Paid Off Over Ten Years?\nAlthough it would require less in annual savings to pay off the national debt over ten years relative to four years, it would still be nearly impossible as a practical matter.\nWe estimate that paying off the debt over the ten-year budget window between FY 2026 and FY 2035 would require cutting spending by about 60 percent – which would lead to $44 trillion of primary spending cuts and an additional $7 trillion of resulting interest savings. This would be the equivalent of eliminating Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps or eliminating all spending besides defense and Social Security.\nThe task becomes even harder when one considers the parts of the budget President Trump has taken off the table, as well as his call to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). For example, President Trump has committed not to touch Social Security, which means all other spending would have to be cut by nearly 85 percent to fully eliminate the national debt by the end of FY 2035.\nAssuming lower revenue from full extension of the TCJA, needed cuts would grow to 90 percent. If Medicare and defense spending were also exempted – as President Trump has sometimes called for – spending would have to be cut by nearly 165 percent, which would obviously be impossible.\nIn other words, spending cuts alone would not be sufficient to pay off the national debt. Massive increases in revenue – which President Trump has generally opposed – would also be needed. The two ways in which President Trump has been willing to consider increasing revenue are from higher tariffs and from assumed (but unlikely to materialize) increases in economic growth. A rosy scenario that incorporates both of these doesn’t make paying off the debt much easier.\nSpecifically, President Trump has called for a Universal Baseline Tariff that we estimate could raise $2.5 trillion over a decade. He has also claimed that he would boost annual real economic growth from about 2 percent per year to 3 percent, which could generate an additional $3.5 trillion of revenue over ten years. Assuming both materialize – a rosy scenario – President Trump would still need to cut all spending by more than 50 percent, or all non-Social Security spending by nearly 75 percent, in order to eliminate the national debt by the end of FY 2035.\nImportantly, it is highly unlikely that this revenue would materialize. As we’ve written before, achieving sustained 3 percent economic growth would be incredibly challenging on its own. Since tariffs generally slow economic growth, achieving these two in tandem would be even less likely.\nWill President Trump Pay Off the Debt?\nWhile no one can know the future with certainty, the cuts necessary to pay off the debt over even ten years (let alone four years) are not even close to realistic. The two largest spending cut bills enacted over the past two decades – the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 and the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023 – reduced spending by 5 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Even these estimates overstate their effects, since much of the BCA’s sequester cuts were ultimately reversed and policymakers are currently working to avoid some of the cuts called for under the FRA. There is no reasonable path for policymakers to enact savings that are orders of magnitude larger than in these bills.\nPercent Spending Cut Needed to Eliminate the National Debt\n| Four Years (next presidential term) |\nTen Years (FY 2026 - FY 2035) |\n|\n|---|---|---|\n| All Spending | 129% | 60% |\n| All Spending Except Social Security | 178% | 84% |\n| All Spending Except Social Security with TCJA Extension | 184% | 90% |\n| All Spending Except Social Security, Medicare, and Defense with TCJA Extension |\n323% | 164% |\n| All Spending (Rosy Scenario) | 123% | 53% |\nSources: Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Congressional Budget Office\nNor does President Trump’s term in office offer any evidence that such massive cuts could be achieved. In his four years as President, President Trump did not sign into law a single piece of legislation that reduced deficits, and only signed one bill that meaningfully reduced spending (by about 0.4 percent). On net, President Trump increased spending quite significantly – by about 3 percent, excluding one-time COVID relief. In total, he approved about $8.4 trillion of new borrowing over ten years.\nDuring President Trump’s term in office, federal debt held by the public grew by $7.2 trillion – from $14.4 to $21.6 trillion. This includes a $3 trillion increase through February of 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States. And even by its own, very rosy estimates, President Trump’s final budget proposal – introduced in February of 2020 – would have allowed debt to rise in each of the subsequent ten years, from $17.9 trillion at the end of FY 2020 to $23.9 trillion by the end of FY 2030.\nSo, while reducing debt is an admirable goal and all candidates should put forward plans to reduce debt as a share of GDP, there is no realistic way that President Trump or any other candidate will pay off the debt any time soon.\nOur Ruling: Almost Certainly False\n*****\nThroughout the 2024 presidential election cycle, US Budget Watch 2024 will bring information and accountability to the campaign by analyzing candidates’ proposals, fact-checking their claims, and scoring the fiscal cost of their agendas.\nBy injecting an impartial, fact-based approach into the national conversation, US Budget Watch 2024 will help voters better understand the nuances of the candidates’ policy proposals and what they would mean for the country’s economic and fiscal future.\nYou can find more US Budget Watch 2024 content here.\n1 During the 2016 campaign, we noted that “no plausible set of policies could pay off the debt in eight years.” With an additional $13.3 trillion added to the debt in the interim, this is even more true today.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

So, the Treasury Department—President Trump had a press conference yesterday, next door, in which he announced a whole new global tariff regime. He’d been promising to do this, well, for 40 years, really. It came not out of nowhere, but it was clearly his intent all along, as stated. But it did rattle people, including some of his supporters. So I just wanted to ask you, big picture: where do you think this leads?\nSec. Scott Bessent: Well, Tucker, thank you for having me. And as you said, the President's been talking about this for four decades. Yes. And this is transformational for the American economy, for the American worker, and for the new Republican alignment. And it’s a combination of the old and new ideas. Some of the old ideas were put away. You know, I always tell everyone—and they don't want to hear it—the original tariff man was Alexander Hamilton. Yes. And he used tariffs to fund the new nation and to protect American industry. President Trump has added a third leg to the stool—he uses tariffs to negotiate. But I think this is not unlike... I was a freshman in college when Ronald Reagan came in, in 1980. A new day in America. And when I talk to people now, and they look back and they look at the Reagan years so fondly—yes, I remember what it was like. And it was choppy. The President? Very choppy. Very choppy. But President Reagan stood the course. And look, this is not an invitation—but at one point in the early ’80s, a farmer showed up with a shotgun at the Federal Reserve to kill Paul Volcker for raising rates. So like I said, that's not an invitation for any action. But it was a tough time. And then in 1984, President Reagan won reelection with 49 states. I think they may have even let Mondale win Minnesota just so it wasn’t a skunk. Just to be nice. Yeah. And that's what President Trump is doing now. For years, the American worker—the middle class—has been eviscerated. American workers have taken it on the chin. And, you know, we're just starting to see some of the research now—like we're seeing research on what's called the China Shock from 2004. It’s just coming out now. And it's what you know. It's what I know. But finally, academics are saying, “Oh gosh, the American workers never recovered from the China Shock. What a surprise.” President Trump sensed it 40 years ago. But out on the campaign trail—starting in 2015 up until last year—he has promised the American workers that the old standard of living can come back. Because what we've seen over the past at least 20 years since the China Shock—but more like the past 30—are these massive distributional problems, where the coasts have done great, yes, and the middle of the country has just seen quality of life, life expectancy, decline. They don't think their children are going to do better than they are. And a lot of people don't care. And President Trump cares. This administration cares. And this is the first step towards realigning that. A lot of our trading partners, including some of our allies, have not been good partners. If tariffs are so bad, why do they have them? Quick question. Why do they have them, right? Or if the American consumer is going to pay all the tariff, then why do they care about the tariff? Right? Because they're going to eat them. So I think that this is the beginning of a process. We're going to reindustrialize. We've gone to a highly financialized economy. We've stopped making things—especially a lot of things that are relevant for national security. I think one of the few good outcomes from COVID was we had a beta test for what maybe a kinetic war with a large adversary could look like. And it turned out that these highly efficient supply chains were not strategically secure. So we don't make our own medicines. We don't make our own semiconductors. We don't make our own ships anymore. So I think if I were to say, “Was there any good outcome from COVID?” it was—it woke the world up to these supply chain problems. So economic security is national security. President Trump and I have talked about that a lot. Okay, so this is a national security issue that we're seeing here. But it's also an economic security issue. And it's to—I don't want to say redistribute—but it is to give working Americans real wage gains and enhance their lives. And I've said out on the campaign trail—one of my most frequent mottos was: Wall Street’s done great. It can continue doing well. But it's Main Street’s turn. It's Main Street’s turn. And that's what we saw yesterday: it's Main Street’s turn.\nCarlson: So over the course of my life—55 years—Wall Street really has been the commonly recognized measure of economic health. Like, how’s the Dow doing? We’ve got entire TV channels devoted to tracking its progress, which has mostly been up during the course of my life. So if the average of the equity averages falls—if the stock market falls—that’s seen by a lot of people as a measure that the economy itself is in decline. Do you think that’s a fair measure?\nSec. Bessent: Look, the market goes up and down. Warren Buffett has a saying: in the short run, the market’s a voting machine; in the long run, it’s a weighing machine. And in the long run, it’s going to weigh: do we have good policies? Yes. And I—in my former business—I commented on market structure, market ups and downs a lot. I'm trying not to do that now. Yes. But for everyone who thinks that these market declines are all based on the President’s economic policies, I can tell you: this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek. So the so-called \"Mag Seven\"—the tech stocks—have been doing very well for about 18 months. They led the market. And I think there was kind of a real dose of reality in what was going on in AI. And I think the U.S. is going to remain the leader in AI. But the AI-related stocks started coming down. So, like, if I were to analyze this in my old hat—and this is the only time I’m going to talk about my old hat—what’s happening with the market? I’d say it’s more of a “Mag Seven” problem, not a “Magnet” problem, right?\nCarlson: So it's deeper. So actually, the markets are—you’re saying in this specific case, with tech stocks—taking a real measure of the value of companies relative to foreign companies?\nSec. Bessent: Well, it’s that. But if we look at the equal-weighted S&P—even after today’s moves—it’s down 4% on the year. On a long-term chart, you wouldn’t even notice that. Yeah. And I think the most important thing that we can do—that I can do as Treasury Secretary, and that President Trump wants to do—is put in sound fundamentals for the underlying economy. And if the underlying economy is good—if taxes are stable, businesses have predictability, we have cheap and plentiful energy, if we deregulate, if we treat our workforce well—then we're going to have a great stock market.\nCarlson: Fair. The President suggested, in describing his plan for tariffs—he said, \"Look, you could conceivably fund a lot of government with tariffs,\" and that would suggest that taxpayers fund less of the burden. So do you expect that these will be accompanied by a congressionally approved tax cut for the middle class?\nSec. Bessent: I just want to go back for a moment to that—one of the things that the tariffs are doing is we are pushing back against other economic systems. So the Chinese have a very different economic system. They have low costs—some would call it literally slave labor. They subsidize industry with subsidized loans. They have a lot of non-tariff barriers. Your show can’t be shown there. Yes. So, we’re pushing back against that. And with the tariff income—it can be substantial. And if we think like a classical model of tariff income: let’s say there's a 10% tariff. Then the currency would appreciate about 40% of that—so 4%. Then the producer in the other country would eat about 4%, and then the U.S. consumer might have a one-time price adjustment of 2%. So in a 10% tariff, maybe the consumer pays 2%. We saw a study out recently—from a group at MIT—that shows with President Trump’s first China tariffs, which were approximately 20%, the price level went up 0.7%. So to answer your question: if we could put on a 20% tariff, have the foreigners pay that, and use that money to bring down our government deficit and keep taxes low? That’s a very unique formula that hasn’t been tried in this country for a long time.\nCarlson: Do you think—but it would require congressional participation to get there, right? To move tax rates? Of course, those are set by the Congress.\nSec. Bessent: Well, what we're going to have now—we are in this very odd, what I would call “betwixt and between”—between the tariff income and what DOGE is doing in terms of cutting government expenses. So, CBO scoring—and for 35 years I was on the other side of the wall, and I would always say, “Oh, well, CBO says this”—I didn’t really realize that CBO scoring is a lot like Enron accounting. It’s not real. And when you actually look at the rules…\nCarlson: But you assumed it was real on the outside—sure, “Well, they’re experts.” Congressional Budget Office.\nSec. Bessent: It's the Congressional Budget Office, and they're well-intentioned people. They just have nonsensical rules. Think about this: when all the scoring is done over a 10-year window, they just assume 1.7 or 1.8% economic growth over the 10 years—and that never moves. Whether you raise taxes or cut taxes—it doesn’t move. So that’s why, like during the campaign, when Vice President Harris was announcing all these big tax increases she wanted to do and things like that, the CBO was scoring her very well. And President Trump wants to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent—that was kind of a blowout number. Because obviously, growth is going to go up a lot when you cut taxes. So, that was a long way of saying: we will not get credit for the tariffs in any bill, because Congress is not going to legislate it. The President’s doing it with executive authority. But the money will be coming in. We’ve already taken in several hundred million dollars on the China tariffs from his first term. We’ve taken in about $35 billion a year just on the old tariffs—not the new ones. So in the CBO window, that’s about $350 billion, which pays for a lot of the President's promises: no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, making interest deductibility available on autos made in the U.S. And think what the President is doing here: he is backing into an affordability solution for the bottom 50% of wage earners. Because they are the ones who will benefit from all four of those programs.\nCarlson: So looking at, say, a year from now—so next, beginning of next April—do you have any sense of how much the U.S. government anticipates bringing in from the tariffs announced yesterday?\nSec. Bessent: It's going to be a moving target, sure. But could it be anywhere from $300 billion to $600 billion a year? Sure.\nCarlson: That's—that's meaningful revenue.\nSec. Bessent: Very meaningful. But what will happen with tariffs over time—the ultimate goal of the tariffs, and the President says it all the time: bring your factory here. That’s the best solution for getting away from a tariff wall. So move your factory from China, from Mexico, from Vietnam—bring it here. What will happen over time is: we’ll have substantial tariff income in the beginning. Manufacturers will build their factories here. The tariffs will drop. But the revenue from the factories—from income taxes, from all the new jobs—will go up. So we’ll be taking it in domestically as the tariffs drop. And why are the tariffs dropping? Because we’re making it here. And our trade deficits are dropping.\nCarlson: So you’ve obviously thought this through. Do you think the United States has the necessary labor force for this transition?\nSec. Bessent: I think we do. I think with AI, with automation, with so many of these factories going to be new—they’re going to be smart factories—I think we’ve got all the labor force we need. And what we're doing on the other side—one of the reasons, other than my support for President Trump, that I came out from behind my desk—I had a pretty good life—and I wanted to come out and really tell people that I was worried about an impending financial calamity, given the high levels of government spending that were leading to high levels of government debt. So what we are doing: on one side, the President is reordering trade. On the other side, we are shedding excess labor in the federal government and bringing down federal borrowings. And then on the other side of that, we will have the labor we need for new manufacturing. We’re going to re-lever the private sector. So the private sector, in essence, has been in recession during the Biden years. This is an opportunity to right-size the federal government and unleash the private sector again, because it's been hemmed down by excessive regulation and it's been crowded out by the government.\nCarlson: Here’s a fact of life you may not learn till you're older, but I'm going to tell you now: it’s very hard to have a good time if you're wearing bad boots. In fact, it may be impossible, and that's why you need Tecovas. As a matter of fact, you don't just need them—you owe them to yourself. So let me ask you—since your job is, in part, to forecast the effects of these policies—do you ever think: we’ve got probably one out of six people in this country here illegally, maybe 50 million illegal aliens, and the President says he wants to deport them. Then you have AI, and the projections there are massive labor market disruption—fewer people needed, you alluded to that a minute ago. Then you have the tariffs. And we can guess at their effect, but we don’t really know, because we’ve never done it. And then you have the reaction from the rest of the world to those tariffs. There are so many huge factors that are effectively unknown—that are black boxes. Do you ever think, “Wow, it’s kind of hard to know what’s going to happen”?\nSec. Bessent: Look, it is. And I always think—you can never be 100% sure. But you can stay within some guardrails and keep moving forward. I can’t remember which Sunday morning show I was on a few weeks ago, but the commentator asked me, “Can you guarantee me there won’t be a recession?” And I said, “I can’t guarantee you anything. There’s nothing that tells me there should be one.” So I believe this is going to work, just like President Reagan believed supply-side economics was going to work. What I do know is that the old system wasn’t working. I think that’s right. And if you look at a system that’s not working, you’ve got to be brave to change it. So what wasn’t working? Would it have been really fun for me to come in and just keep issuing a lot of debt? It's almost like a bodybuilder taking steroids—outside, looks great, muscular. Inside, you’re killing your vital organs. That’s what was going on here. It would’ve been easy to keep pumping up the economy, borrowing a lot of money, creating a lot of government jobs—there’s no controversy when you're doing all that. But you were going to end up in a calamity. Go back and look at the financial crisis in ’07–’08. The economy looked great right up until it didn’t. Look at the end of the dot-com bubble, then the whole credit problem, the fraud at WorldCom, Enron—some other companies. The economy looked great... until it didn’t. And I think one of the things we won’t get credit for—but that this administration will have done—is avoiding a financial calamity. Think about it: there’s an analysis that one of the reasons 9/11 happened was because the airlines didn’t want to pay for reinforced cockpit doors. They kept pushing back, FAA didn’t push hard enough. Well now we’ve got the reinforced doors. So I look at it this way: we’re putting on the reinforced doors before the crash.\nCarlson: What’s the lobbying scramble by foreign governments going to be like over the next three months? Because the President said yesterday, “I’m putting a universal tariff,”—you know, one standard. But then of course, each country is adjusted according to a lot of different factors: trade deficit, currency manipulation, regulation, tariffs. But this is all, as you said, a moving picture. So like—if I’m a country like Vietnam, or China—I mean, I’m going to try really hard to bring pressure to bear on this administration to adjust those numbers. What’s that going to be like?\nSec. Bessent: It’s going to be the President’s decision. And I think his view is: this has been going on for a long time—for friends and foes—and we’re going to see where this plays out. I think what’s going to be more important than the discussions with countries is the discussions with companies. What do companies want to do? As President Trump said yesterday, the best way to get around the tariff is: build your factory here. And what can we do here at Treasury to help that? We’re pushing to get the tax bill done so we can guarantee the low taxes, full depreciation within the first year. We’re working with Secretaries Burgum and Wright on energy security. We’re working on getting the regulations down. The President—I don’t know whether he talked about it yesterday or the day before—but Taiwan Semi, the biggest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, needs permits. Lee Zeldin, the EPA commissioner, is working to push through all the permits they need. Because we’ve just gone into this regulatory morass where it takes so long to get things done in this country. So I think what will be more interesting are the individual company announcements—more than the country announcements.\nCarlson: You want to sell to Americans? You’ve got to make it in America. Sure. Or pay the tariff. So how is China, as a nation, going to respond? I mean, this is such a big challenge—it’s directly in their face. It's about every country on the globe, but it's really, more than any other country, about China. I think that's fair to say. How are they going to respond? What's the retaliation look like?\nSec. Bessent: Well, I don’t know if they can retaliate—for a couple of reasons. If you look at the history—and I used to teach economic history—when you look at it, we are the debtor nation. Yes, we have the trade deficits. The surplus nation is in the weaker position. Because the Chinese business model—and by the way, the Chinese business model and economy are the most imbalanced in the history of the modern world. We’ve never seen anything like this in terms of their export level relative to GDP, relative to population. So I think it is going to be very difficult for them to try to change the model. They’re trying. They’re in a deflationary recession—slash depression—right now. They’re trying to export their way out of it. And we can’t let them do that. But when you think about it, the Chinese manufacturing system is like that old Disney movie with the brooms carrying the buckets. There’s nothing you can do—it just keeps going. That’s their business model. It’s not going to stop. Now, what could happen—if you were to say, “Scott, what’s the dream scenario?”—it’s that somehow there could be a deal where the U.S. and China… We want more manufacturing, which would mean a smaller part of the economy is consumption. The Chinese have this imbalanced economy with too much manufacturing. And actually, Chinese consumers really get the short end of the stick. Chinese households—they’re caught in what’s called the middle-income trap. Could we do something together where they rebalance—consume more, manufacture less? We consume less, manufacture more? We’ll still be military rivals. There’ll still be economic rivalry. But we’d level the playing field by a lot. Now, that’s not going to happen tomorrow. That’s not going to happen in a month. But over the next few years, they may have to come around. Because I think their business model is broken. I think President Trump has broken their business model with these tariffs.\nCarlson: So you’re describing, you know, the famous scenario where—if you take out a bank loan, the bank is in charge. But if you take a big enough loan, you’re kind of in charge of the bank.\nSec. Bessent: Exactly. And they’ve just got such a big deficit with us that they need our markets. They can’t survive without them.\nCarlson: Are you confident that there’s a clear enough channel of communication between the two governments—that the details can be worked out and nothing will go crazy in the meantime?\nSec. Bessent: I think what gives me a lot of confidence is the relationship between President Trump and Chairman Xi. When you have a direct line of communication at the very top, then I think it’s very difficult for things to go haywire.\nCarlson: What about the rest of the world? What about Europe?\nSec. Bessent: Look, the Europeans—go back to that famous meeting where President Trump told the Europeans: “You’re insane for building Nord Stream 2. What are you doing? You already get most of your energy from Russia and you’re going to double down on it?” And they did. And look what happened.\nCarlson: So we blew it up.\nSec. Bessent: Putin. Some Norwegian fisherman bumped into it is what I read. But the Europeans go kicking and screaming—but I think they’re going to have to rebalance too. Germany has a very imbalanced export economy. They were on the verge of deindustrialization. They were the opposite of us: they had expensive energy, they were depending on Italy and the countries in the south to keep the euro suppressed, and they were selling into China. Now China is becoming their competitor.\nCarlson: So you said at the outset—the first example, the analogy you used—was President Reagan’s first term. Big win in ’80, recession in ’82, wipeout, and then the biggest landslide in history in ’84. So you’re suggesting, by saying that, that the fruits were obvious within the first term—within four years?\nSec. Bessent: They were. Only difference now is, there was a lot of competition back then—but there was a level of civility. The real danger here—if there were a midterm loss, and I don’t think there has to be—you know what’s going to happen. I know what’s going to happen. Democratic House is going immediately to impeachment for something, of course. The lawfare is going to start again. And I think the American people are going to hate it—again. Einstein’s definition of insanity: doing the same thing again and expecting a different result.\nCarlson: Do you think that—and this is really aimed at the people who support President Trump and who agree with you wholeheartedly that the current system was really bad. And, like, drive across the country, you’ll see how bad it has been—horrible. It lowered life expectancy. But the people who are hoping that yesterday’s move will lead to a demonstrably brighter future within four years— Is it your sincere prediction that within four years, we’ll say, “Actually, that kind of worked”?\nSec. Bessent: I believe that it’s going to work. And I know that what we were doing wasn’t working. Yes. So I think we have to try this. And I have a high confidence ratio it’s going to work. And I have a very high confidence ratio… The good news is, we have President Trump’s previous term, when everyone said none of this was going to work: “Oh, the China tariffs are going to do this. They’re going to cause inflation.” They didn’t. “This is going to hurt working-class Americans.” Well, guess what? Working-class Americans—hourly workers—did better than supervisory workers. The bottom 50% of households—their net worth increased faster than the top 10% of households. I’m not happy with what’s going on in the market today, but the distribution of equities across households? The top 10% of Americans own 88% of equities. Eighty-eight percent of the stock market. The next 40% owns 12%. The bottom 50% has debt. They have credit card bills. They rent their homes. They have auto loans. And we’ve got to give them some relief.\nCarlson: That’s the message right there. Just as a bystander, I’m like, “Wow. Okay. All right. Heard that.”\nSec. Bessent: I like the examples. And I was really struck by two different statistics last year—summer of 2024: Americans took more European vacations than they had in history. Summer of 2024—more Americans were using food banks than they ever have in history. I went into two food banks near my hometown to ask, “What’s the story?” And they said, “You know, for a lot of people, it really takes a loss of dignity to walk into a food bank.” Of course. But they were seeing a new phenomenon: it wasn’t their traditional clientele. It wasn’t people who lost their homes. It wasn’t people out on the street. These were working families who could no longer afford $100 at the grocery store. That basket of groceries every week—they were missing five, six, seven things. And they were coming to the food bank to top up. So that’s not a great America. Record European vacations. Record food bank usage. No reason we can’t keep the record European vacations going—but we’ve got to take care of these other people. And you know what? They don’t want handouts. The Democrats had this strategy called “compensate the loser.” First of all, the name of that strategy? I don’t think the bottom 50% of Americans are losers. I think the system hasn’t worked for them. I think they are winners—it’s just a bad system. So we are going to fix the system. And look—they want good jobs. They want their kids to do better than they do. They want to own a home. They want to pay down their debt. This isn’t hard. And I think we can do this in the next four years.\nCarlson: It used to be only crazy people thought they were being watched all the time—surveilled—the guy mumbling next to you on the bus. But now, anyone who knows what’s going on thinks that, because it’s true. Your phones are listening to you. Tech companies are tracking all your online activity in order to profit off what ought to be private information. Governments are watching too. It’s a corrupt system. It’s frightening. And the worst part is—it’s all legal. Government certainly will not help stop this. Of course, the intel agencies love it. So it’s up to you to protect yourself. And that’s where ExpressVPN comes in. So—you grew up in a middle-class, working-class background. You were very successful. Lived in rich-person world for a long time while this was all going on. And I just have to ask you candidly: were you ever at dinner with people who were like, “Wow, we’re doing great”? I live in rich-person world too. I’m not criticizing you at all. But did anyone at dinner ever say, “Wow, I just drove 100 miles—this country doesn’t look good. People are not thriving.” Was there any sense of that among the people you knew?\nSec. Bessent: No. They were more like, “My NetJets was an hour late. I had the worst day. I’m switching charter companies.” Look, Tucker, I’m especially attuned to what I think is going on with the United States because—I’ll tell you, my family was very affluent. Early settlers. We were very affluent for about 250 years. My dad made a lot of bad financial choices. So when I was born—the first six, seven, eight years—we were affluent. He lost everything. So I’ve seen what that’s like. I’ve seen both sides. I was fortunate enough to be able to make it back. I know what economic insecurity is like. And I don’t think people should have to have that. If you want to work hard—and people want to work hard—you were out on the campaign trail with President Trump. I was out on the campaign trail. And I’ve got to say—one of the most moving things for me was at the final two stops: Pittsburgh and Grand Rapids, Michigan. In Pittsburgh—in the Duquesne arena—I walk in, and there are the union workers. The steel workers. They’ve got on their hats. They’ve got on their vests. They’re there with their children. It was very moving. They just want a better life. They want their communities to be sound. They want their kids to do better. They want Little League baseball. They don’t care what’s going on on Madison Avenue. They don’t know what the hot new restaurant is in Paris. And President Trump has somehow assembled this incredible coalition—Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, the folks who were in the Rose Garden yesterday, and the people I saw at the Duquesne arena. I think it’s unbelievable.\nCarlson: Interesting. What do you worry about as Treasury Secretary? I mean, obviously—probably lying in bed at night, thinking about all the things that could go wrong with the U.S. economy. What are your—if you could be honest—what are your biggest worries?\nSec. Bessent: So, to the extent that in my business career I had a strong point, I think it was risk management. I view myself as the United States’ leading bond salesman. Yep. And I think that with what’s going on, I’m going to have a better and better story to tell as we get our economic health and fiscal house in order. Then I try to imagine what could go very wrong. What would we do if there were another outbreak similar to COVID? You can’t worry about things like that—but I worry about a kinetic war somewhere. What would we do in the event of something happening? What I try to do is create the situation where I can worry a little less every day. So I’ll tell you: I came in—I was confirmed on January 28—and during the month of January, 10-year interest rates—which is probably the most important rate in the country, since mortgages and capital formation are based on it—had almost spiked to 5%. And I think 5% can be an uncomfortable area for the economy, for Treasury, for issuing bonds. Now that I’ve gotten in, I worry a little less. But I still worry. We’ve got a tremendous amount of debt to roll. And I worry that we won’t do the smart cuts and focus on waste, fraud, and abuse. I worry that that gets sidelined. Then on the other side, I worry that the tax bill somehow gets bogged down. We could have the largest tax increase in history. Or I worry about the usual geopolitical things—whether it’s Iran, Taiwan—that something goes haywire between Russia and Ukraine.\nCarlson: So you began your job description by saying you’re a bond salesman. You’re selling America’s debt to the world. And I know that was a big part of the portfolio as the transition was envisioning it—“Who can make the case for American bonds to the world?” How is your case? Are you confident you can do that? And how is your pitch changing after yesterday?\nSec. Bessent: Right now we’re in this strange “betwixt and between,” because we’re going to take in substantial tariff revenue. And what DOGE is doing is substantially cutting expenses. But we’re not getting credit for it right now. I think the market’s starting to get a hint of it. The 10-year bond, which had almost peaked at 5%, is now through 4%. A way to think about it is: every 100 basis points is about $1 trillion in savings. So we’ve saved $100 billion. That’s probably not going to happen that quickly again. But I think we are setting the sails for a much better fiscal time. People don’t have to say, “The U.S. is out of control. The U.S. is going to default.” We’re not. And I think every day, my case gets better.\nSec. Bessent: And like, if we were to just imagine a very reductionist formula for government—G equals S minus T—government spending minus taxes. For “spending,” our side—the Republicans—likes to spend, but less than the Democrats. But both sides like to spend. Then you have “minus T”—taxes. Democrats like higher taxes. We like lower taxes. What if the “S” actually went down? To me, that’s the exciting part. That’s been unthinkable in everybody’s calculation.\nCarlson: No one’s even seriously raised it—including Ronald Reagan, by the way.\nSec. Bessent: Right. And look, I think President Reagan had a different agenda. He ramped up defense spending. And remember—“Oh, he’s crazy. It’s going to break the budget. Star Wars is crazy. He’s a madman.” And then the Iron Curtain went down. So it’s actually a Soviet term. He used the Soviet strategy on themselves—on the Russians. Escalate to de-escalate. We escalated military spending. They tried to keep up. And then they collapsed. Everything’s easy in hindsight. But I think here, what we’re doing—bringing down these incredible levels of spending—but more importantly… I tell anyone who will listen: DOGE is the Office of Government Efficiency. Not Elimination. Not Extinction. So what if we can actually do a better job with less? Seems inconceivable—but when I see what’s going on in a lot of these government agencies, it’s unbelievable. Like, I’ve lived in Manhattan, I’ve lived in Florida. Roughly, the state of New York and the state of Florida have the same number of people. Actually, Florida has a few more now. New York’s budget is about $235 billion. Florida’s is $125 billion. How do they do that? Oh yeah—and there’s no income tax in Florida. Oh yeah—and the roads are better. You go to get your driver’s license—it takes 15 minutes, not five hours. So can we make the rest of America look more like Florida—and less like New York?\nOr one day, is New York going to look more like Florida?\nCarlson: So do you think after four years, we will see an actual net reduction in government spending—thanks to DOGE?\nSec. Bessent: Inflation-adjusted? Yes.\nCarlson: How long do you think Elon is in for?\nSec. Bessent: Day to day? I don’t know. But I think his imprint is going to be with us a long time. And I think the mainstream media has tried to demonize DOGE and all the folks who work with him. And we’ve got a couple of Treasury—a couple of IRS—employees who I hired, who I interviewed. I’ll tell you—there’s one fellow, Tom Kraus. He was on TV with Bret Baier the other night. Tom’s incredible. He’s done $100 billion of tech mergers. With my investment business, I would’ve hired him. I don’t think I could have afforded him. He is doing this for the good of his country. He came in without touching any of the payment systems—contrary to what the Washington Post falsely reported. He analyzed the system, and within six weeks, pointed at all the vulnerabilities. There’s a young man named Sam Kirkos, who was on Laura Ingraham with me the other night. That was my idea—bring him out of the shadows. Let’s make this demonization stop. This young man—other than the fact that he only owns one pair of pants, which he likes telling everyone—I’d be happy if our daughter brought him home. He’s a patriot. He’s working hard for the country. He’s analytical. And the things he’s seen at the IRS—just in their tech systems—and that’s all he does. You know, Elon has a shirt that he wears under his jacket. He flashes it every once in a while. It says “Tech Support.” That’s what we’re getting. We’ve got a Blockbuster-style government in a Netflix world. We’re hailing cabs in an Uber economy. Why can’t the government be in the gig economy? Not hard.\nCarlson: We’re not positive that cryptocurrency is the future of finance—but we do know that what we have now is broken and dangerous. Can I ask you a weird question? Who runs the Federal Reserve, exactly? How can you have this pivotal institution that has the most direct effect on markets—but it seems outside of political control?\nSec. Bessent: Well, look—I was at a dinner Jerome Powell attended last night. During my confirmation hearing, I said: I’m only going to talk about the mistakes the Fed has made in the past. I won’t talk about the ones they’re going to make in the future. But I think it is important that monetary policy be walled off. Some of the other things they’ve done—like DEI, like climate—they impinge on their monetary credibility. I think the Fed should focus on monetary policy—doing the best they can for the American economy, the American people. Keeping inflation low. There are a lot of other banking agencies to do the rest.\nCarlson: The Fed controls the weather now too. What were they doing with climate?\nSec. Bessent: Well, Treasury chairs something called the Financial Stability Oversight Council. It’s all the financial regulators. Two weeks before Silicon Valley Bank went under, FSOC issued a report. They said the biggest risk to the financial system was climate. Really? Not that a large bank in California was having a slow-motion run on its assets? They failed. The regulators failed. People are getting sick of that. And it goes back to one of my favorite Trump phrases: common sense. It’s just common sense. If your deposits can leave with a click—you shouldn’t have all these long-term assets. But the regulators were too busy worrying about the weather. And there was also some degree of regulatory capture. The CEO of Silicon Valley Bank was on the board of the San Francisco Fed—his chief regulator. They’re going to tell that guy what to do.\nCarlson: Why is gold moving around the world in such huge quantities right now?\nSec. Bessent: A couple of reasons. It’s moving physically. Uncertainty about whether gold would be exempt from tariffs. I believe we have exempted it. But there was a big move out of vaults in Switzerland and London to get it into New York. Gold has always been a store of value. We’re seeing huge demand from China. They're in an economic recession or depression. Their people don’t trust the yuan. There are capital controls. 1.4 billion people want to get their money out—and they can’t. But they can buy gold.\nCarlson: Do you find it interesting that even now—in 2025—when everything is abstract and digital, gold is still believed to be reliable?\nSec. Bessent: Gold has history going for it. A friend of mine’s grandmother, during Russia’s financial crisis in ’98, bought 18 bicycles. That was her store of value.\nCarlson: How’d she do on the bike investment?\nSec. Bessent: Great. I wish I’d done that well. Gold can’t run a deficit. It can’t default. It can’t go to war. It’s isolated from government failure. That’s why people trust it.\nCarlson: So you’re not anti-gold?\nSec. Bessent: Oh no. When I had my fund, people would’ve called me a gold bug.\nCarlson: How did you wind up interacting with Zelensky?\nSec. Bessent: The President asked me to go to Kyiv. He actually asked me to lead the economic agreement that was part of his peace plan. It’s important to understand the arc of President Trump’s peace plan. He sequenced it well:\n- Sign a deal with the Ukrainians to link the U.S. and Ukraine closer together.\n- Signal to Russian leadership that we’re not abandoning Ukraine.\n- Show the American people that we have an economic stake in Ukraine—this isn’t just about massive grants.\nSo if Ukraine succeeds, we succeed. It could be a long-term partnership. I thought it was important to take the agreement to Kyiv and present it to President Zelensky. Everyone was telling me, “Oh no, meet him in Vienna. He’ll be at the Munich Security Conference.” I said no—I want to go there and discuss it with him. So that’s how I ended up in Kyiv. Very interesting trip: fly to Poland, then get on this 10-hour night train and arrive in Kyiv at 8:30 in the morning. And for everyone who said, “President Trump is selling out to the Russians”—he’s not. The Russians bombed Kyiv four hours before I got there. They hadn’t bombed since November. They didn’t like the look of this deal—it was durable for both the American and Ukrainian people. President Zelensky was in the mood to sign the deal that day. We had a spirited discussion. I said, “You’ve got 50 reporters out there. I’m here to show there’s no daylight between our two peoples, our two governments. You’ve opened up daylight the size of the Grand Canyon.” He said, “Tell them I’m going to sign the deal in Munich.” I said, “So when you see Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Rubio, you’ll sign it?” “Yes.” He didn’t sign it there. Then the following week, his team begged to come to the White House. We said: sign the deal first. He got to the Oval Office and blew up what should have been the easiest thing to do in the world. He was supposed to show up, have a press conference, then we’d have a private lunch. If he had anything to air, that was the time. There’s a famous photo in the East Room—everything laid out, ready to be signed. It never got signed.\nCarlson: So this is an unelected president of a client state, whose bureaucrats are being paid directly by American taxpayers—including retirement accounts?\nSec. Bessent: Yes. And they have the lowest retirement age in Europe—60. France is 62. Italy is 67. We’re paying for that.\nCarlson: And yet—this man is in a precarious position—and he acts high-handed, sniffs a lot, berates American officials. How do you account for that arrogance?\nSec. Bessent: Well, a couple things. He was a performer—a vaudevillian. An ordinary person thrown into a fraught time. He rose to the occasion. He was heroic. But now he’s stuck. Some in his cabinet are good. Some of the people around him—not so much. He’s not getting the best advice. And here’s the thing: the agreement made sure the money came to the American people and the Ukrainian people. Let me tell you what it wasn’t:\n–It wasn’t one of these rapacious Chinese deals—“Sign over your mine, your port…”\n– It wasn’t a loan-to-own scheme—“Here’s a loan you’ll never pay back so we take your asset.” It was a real economic partnership. They put in assets. We put in loans through our development banks. We put in American know-how. We don’t make any money unless they make money. You know who didn’t like that? People with their hands in the till. Because we were regulating the flow of money. That’s part of the glitch. I’m hopeful that it was a bug, not a feature. We’re expecting a Ukrainian technical team next week. I’m hopeful we can get it signed and return to a win-win. President Trump’s plan was: Sign with Ukraine. Show Russia we stand with Ukraine economically. Bring Russia to the table. The sequencing’s been thrown off—but I think we can fix it.\nCarlson: Are we ever going to get an audit of where all of our billions went? The weapons? The cash? The pallets of $100 bills? Why is that so hard?\nSec. Bessent: I don’t know. I always try to look forward. If this deal works, that money could end up being small change. Think about this: in 1991, when the Iron Curtain fell, Poland and Ukraine had economies of similar size. Today, Poland’s economy is 3.5x or 4x bigger—and growing. Ukraine? Held back by kleptocracy. With U.S. assistance and a Trump-brokered peace, the Ukrainian people could finally move forward.\nCarlson: For a Treasury Secretary, you're a very capable diplomat, I must say—very diplomatic language. Last question: because this is all so new—just going back to the tariff announcement—how do you keep message discipline in the administration? Who decides how to explain this? How do you keep everyone on the same page?\nSec. Bessent: We all take President Trump’s lead. We had a meeting yesterday morning. Then a meeting after the Rose Garden announcement before we went out on media. He’s his own best spokesman. No one does it better. Then we fan out—and we are all unified behind his vision. That’s why we’re here. If you don’t want to be part of it—you shouldn’t be here.\nCarlson: Do you ever say, “Hey, this person reassures markets; that person scares them—let’s send the right person out?”\nSec. Bessent: The one thing I’ll say: no one should listen to anyone in the markets talk about the U.S. dollar other than President Trump or myself. We’re the only ones who speak for this administration on dollar policy. We have a strong dollar policy. And we’re putting in all the ingredients to make sure the dollar is strong over the long run. Can it go up and down in the short run? Sure. Can there be bilateral moves between the dollar and other currencies? Sure—that’s what I made a living doing. But over time, if we put in sound fundamentals and follow through on this transformation, the dollar will do great—and so will the American people.\nCarlson: Secretary, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Most presidents wait until they leave the White House to cash in, but President Trump takes a different approach. Crypto deals, hotels, golf courses, 747s, everything is on the table. The panel discusses the ways Trump is treating the White House, and Mar-a-Lago, as a place to make sure his children are even richer than he is.\nClip: How Trump is using his power to profit and why no one will stop him\nMay. 30, 2025 AT 8:52 p.m. EDT\nTRANSCRIPT\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nJeffrey Goldberg: So, here's a partial list of deals and moves Donald Trump has done that would have sunk any other president. He's accepted a $400 million plane as a gift from a Middle East autocracy that hosts both Hamas and the Taliban, and also may be the home of a new Trump hotel. He's dined with top investors in one of his cryptocurrency projects and reportedly promised to promote the crypto industry from the White House. He's pardoned prominent Republicans and reality T.V. stars, including a man convicted of securities fraud, who, with his wife, donated $1.8 million to Trump's reelection campaign, for good measure.\nBy the way, he commuted the sentence of the leader of the murder of Chicago criminal and organization, the Gangster Disciples, Trump's family is charging half a million dollars to join a private club in Washington, D.C. He's building a golf resort in Vietnam, a country seeking tariff relief for $1.5 billion, and a Trump skyscraper in Ho Chi Minh City, a fact, ho Chi Minh himself would've undoubtedly found darkly amusing.\nThe Trump organization is planning to build a Trump Tower in Riyadh, for good measure. After a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Jeff Bezos agreed to pay $40 million to license a documentary about Melania Trump, the most expensive licensing fee ever paid for a documentary. I could go on. I. But I won't because I want our panel to tell us what this all means.\nJoining me tonight, Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent at The New York Times, Leigh Ann Caldwell is the chief Washington correspondent for Puck, and Steven Hayes is the editor of The Dispatch. Thank you for joining me.\nI want to read you all something from my colleague, David Frum, just wrote about Trump and his relationship to corruption. Quote, nothing like this has ever been attempted or even imagined in the history of the American presidency. Throw away the history books, discard people, comparisons to scandals of the past. There is no analogy with any previous action by any past president. The brazenness of the self-enrichment resembles nothing seen in any earlier White House. This is American corruption on the scale of a post-Soviet republic or a post-colonial African dictatorship.\nPeter, agree, disagree, is there any precedent for what we're seeing in American history?\nPeter Baker, Chief White House Correspondent, The New York Times: No, I mean, there really isn't. Nothing comes close at this point, no. There have been presidents who have monetized the presidency on some level or another. They used it to benefit their family businesses or whatever. Certainly, there have been family members who tried to trade off their famous presidents.\nJeffrey Goldberg: That's more happens more often than not.\nPeter Baker: It happens.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Yes.\nPeter Baker: It happened in the last administration, let's face it. Hunter Biden certainly traded off his father's name, but it was penny-ante compared to what we're talking about now. Even if you believe all the worst allegations against Hunter Biden, it would be a tiny fraction of what we're seeing now in terms of the scale and scope of these billions of dollars. Literally this cryptocurrency thing alone, his family and businesses have got $320 million in fees just in the four months since he started it for creating nothing, by the way. I'm not much of an expert on crypto stuff, but that seems to be you don't actually have anything. There's no actual tower at the end of the day. It's just this coin, and he's already made hundreds of millions of dollars.\nSo, now, the question is what does that do in terms of policy? That's the next question. You can certainly make some connections, right? The guy who shows up at this crypto dinner, Justin Sun, just had the SEC say, we're going to pause our fraud case against him. So, he comes back to the country where he hadn't been in a couple years after paying tens of millions of dollars for this crypto coin that he's bought.\nIs there a direct connection? It doesn't look good, obviously. And that's the problem with conflict of interest. Even if you're doing everything on the up and up, the appearance usually makes most presidents say, let's not do that because it might give the wrong impression. Trump has no problem with this.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Peter, you're giving me the impression that you have not yet purchased the Washington Week meme coin. I'm a little --\nPeter Baker: I'm looking for the discount.\nJeffrey Goldberg: I don't know if we're going to see you back at this table. Yes, I don't know if we're going to see you back at this table.\nLeigh Ann, it's interesting, you know, like in Watergate, you know, by August of 1974, Republican leaders, House and Senate, bring Barry Goldwater with them as top cover to the White House, tell Richard Nixon, your support is evaporating across Congress, Democrat, obviously, but Republican as well. By, you know, the next day, Nixon resigns even before, you know, impeachment. Something remarkable has changed in Washington, and maybe it's a tribalism, maybe it's fear. But where is Congress on all of this. As Peter points out, Republicans were very activated by Hunter Biden's activities. No activation here, whatsoever.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell, Chief Washington Correspondent, Puck: Yes. Remember they were trying to impeach President Biden because of Hunter Biden's activities. Yes, Republicans are completely silent about it. In fact, there's legislation on the Hill, in the Senate, right now called the Genius Act, which is about crypto, that was stalled for several weeks. Because once this crypto news with the president came out, Democrats demanded that there be some constraints on the administration when it comes to deals like this. They never reached an agreement, and this bipartisan legislation is moving forward without those constraints on the administration trying to rein in and make some of this maybe not illegal, but some guardrails around it.\nBut another thing is the president is immune from any sort of repercussions other than congressional impeachment, right? The Supreme Court has already ruled that the president cannot be charged with anything. And Republicans do not have any motivation, political, or any way, to break with the president on this. This is not something that they think is worth getting in front of the president on.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Can I ask you this, though? I mean, and I know this probably will sound naive to you, but you said they have no political motivation, but what about just being shocked ethically or morally by this kind of brazen business dealing in the White House?\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: Yes. So, yes, you think that is how it should play out.\nJeffrey Goldberg: I mean, you talk to people all the time and you talk to them privately as well. Is there any private anxiety about this, private anger?\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: I mean, privately they're like, yes, this isn't great. Publicly, you seem some, you see some who say, you know, well, we would prefer if it wasn't like this, like Senator Josh Hawley is one of those people who has said something publicly, but they're not willing to do anything about it.\nAnd let me flip the question around, because even the Democrats aren't really making this much of an issue. And the reason they're not talking to Democrats is, first of all, the flood the zone thing is absolutely working. They can barely keep up. But also Democrats are telling me, look, everyone knows that Donald Trump is corrupt. It is already baked in what people think about him. They also think that all politicians are corrupt. And so this is not a political argument that works right now.\nAnd so they are trying to refocus everything on chaos, on how Donald Trump is not helping inflation and cost and not helping your pocketbook specifically because they found that people just don't really care and respond to the corruption.\nJeffrey Goldberg: I guess one of the things I'm surprised at, Steve, is, throughout American history, there have been consequences for this kind of self-dealing, right, whether it's Ulysses Grant whose reputation suffered because of a corruption in the cabinet, Warren Harding, the Teapot Dome scandal, up to Watergate, obviously, and more minor incident. This seems completely novel in American history. How do you explain the fact that no one seems to care?\nStephen Hayes, Editor, The Dispatch: Yes. I mean, I think, you know, what you read from David Frum was accurate. I agree with Peter. This is unprecedented. And, you know, during the first Trump term, I think too many of our colleagues said things were unprecedented that weren't in fact unprecedented. This is truly unprecedented. We haven't seen this before.\nAnd I think one of the reasons that there's not more outrage, as Leigh Ann's last point, there's a general sense, certainly on the Republican side, rank and file Republican voters believe that everybody does this. This is what's been going on in Washington. Remember, Donald Trump ran and he was going to drain the swamp. This is the way that people perceive Washington working. And Trump just does it with a little -- he's a little bigger, does it with a little more flare. He's a little more aggressive, right, right. And I think that's how you get Republican voters who can rationalize this, having talked to some of them about it.\nAnd in Congress, you know, I think there's a divide on the Republican side. You have the sort of hardcore MAGA supporters who say, this is great. I'm glad he is doing this. I don't care. This is what everybody's done all along. Then you have the, I'd say a quiet majority who thinks it's awful and they will tell you it's awful off the record or in private conversation. But they don't love it. They're not going to step up to do much about it.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Are any of them, not to be overly cynical now, are any of them making money on any of this?\nStephen Hayes: I mean, that's a real question, I think, you know, and it's a question about the tariffs and what he is doing with the tariffs every single day. I mean, if you know that these things are coming, you know, he announced he wants to now double the steel tariffs suddenly. People weren't expecting this. But if you knew that this was coming and you could potentially place bets that way, it could be profitable.\nPeter Baker: Well, and that's the thing, right? The president may be immune for actions that are officially, you know, part of his job. People around him aren't. And, normally, administrations, in fact, find, you mentioned a couple of examples where presidents themselves didn't get in trouble, but the people around them had done a lot of things, well, we don't know, right? If somebody playing the market here, if they know the president, as you say, is going to say something and it'll tank the market or the other way around, you can time it. There's no regulation right now. There's no regulatory authority right now that seems eager to look at that. Why?\nJeffrey Goldberg: Well, I want to come back to that point in one minute, but, Steve, I want to ask you a question about the foreign entanglements here. It's one thing to have this guy who's like, you know, got pardoned because of some securities thing or some of these other characters who make donations to his campaign, but it's quite another thing to get into bed with Middle East autocracies, communist nations, communist governments from Asia. There are national security consequences here, yes?\nStephen Hayes: Huge potential.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Talk about those.\nStephen Hayes: Well, look, I mean, I remember it wasn't that long ago when people like me were obsessed with reporting on Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. And those were, you know, I suppose if you wanted to -- I still have problems with them. I thought it was grubby at the time. But at least they were sort of a bank shot to the person who's not still in charge.\nThese are just open and aggressive.\nJeffrey Goldberg: But what do you mean by that? Go into that a little bit.\nStephen Hayes: Well, I mean, you know, the $400 million plane that you mentioned.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Yes.\nStephen Hayes: I mean, this is -- you know, Donald Trump is accepting this. He's celebrating it. He's got his people on his staff who are justifying it, rationalizing it, saying, we'd be crazy not to do this. That's far worse than anything we reported on with respect to the Clinton Foundation back in 2016.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Maybe you could help me understand something about the Trumpian mentality. I want you to watch something. This was from a meeting President Trump had in the Oval Office with the president of South Africa a little while back, a little while ago. Let's just watch this for a second.\nCyril Ramaphosa, South African President: I am sorry I don't have a plane to give you.\nDonald Trump, U.S. President: I wish you did. I would take it. If your country offered the United States Air Force a plane, I would take it.\nJeffrey Goldberg: He's serious.\nStephen Hayes: Yes. I think he's serious.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: Yes.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Is he serious?\nPeter Baker: He's not smiling.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: Yes.\nPeter Baker: No.\nJeffrey Goldberg: What's the thought process there? Why would he do this in the Oval Office? I mean, it seems degrading to the United States, the richest country in the world, to say, pay me tribute in your -- give me old planes and I'll take them. I don't understand.\nStephen Hayes: Yes. I mean, look, I think he likes it when people sort of kowtow to him and go in and kiss the ring. I think that's exactly what was happening there. And, you know, it's part -- Peter alluded to this earlier. Part of what makes it hard to keep up with is that is the volume of it and that it is so out in the open. And, you know, you have talked to Republicans on the hill and they will say, hey, you know, the Hunter Biden stuff was all hush, hush. And, you know, these payments for his bad art that, God, and we had to subpoena people to find out about this. Trump's doing it in the open, so it must be justifiable. You're actually seeing Republicans make those arguments and I think it's a strength of Trump's.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: They're literally comparing it to France, giving us the Statue of Liberty, like the airplane equates the Statue of Liberty.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Yes. I mean, you know, there is something interesting here that in journalism, obviously, a lot of the energy of investigative journalism goes into exposing the cover-up. But, Leigh Ann, there's no cover-up, period. There's just business, like business that would have been considered scandalous in any other administration.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: And when Donald Trump Jr. goes overseas to help ink these deals, they're very open about it. And, yes, and there are -- and no investigations on the Republican side into this. There are a couple letters and inquiries from the Democratic side in Congress into this.\nBut, you know, Republicans are still investigating President Biden's administration. The Oversight Committee in the House just opened another investigation into the auto pen. And so they are still obsessed with that while all of this, like you said, is completely out in the open.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Could you just do 20 seconds for all the normal people at home that don't follow the autopen scandal, what the Autopen scandal is.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: Yes. Should I look into camera and explain?\nJeffrey Goldberg: Yes. Talk to America about the autopen for a minute.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: The fact that President Biden, Republicans say, was so incapacitated that staffers were running the government using his signature with an autopen.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Right, which is not actually scandalous because presidents often use autopens to sign vast numbers of --\nPeter Baker: Also produced zero facts on this. This is simply them trying to say, well, he's so doddering, he must have had aides with the autopen, they have no idea.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: Correct.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Right.\nPeter Baker: And it doesn't matter that there are no facts behind it.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: But they are subpoenaing people to come in.\nJeffrey Goldberg: And, Peter, one more angle on this that I'm interested in. Congress is obviously not providing muscular oversight now, but there used to be in government, various bodies within the executive branch that would provide self-oversight.\nPeter Baker: Yes.\nJeffrey Goldberg: I want to read you something that you just wrote. Mr. Trump, the first convicted felon elected president, has erased ethical boundaries and dismantled the instruments of accountability that constrained his predecessors. There will be no official investigations because Mr. Trump has made sure of it. He has fired government inspectors general and ethics watchdogs, installed partisan loyalists around the Justice Department, FBI and regulatory agency and dominated Republican-controlled Congress unwilling to hold hearings. Talk about the changes that have been made in the inspector general system in the last five months.\nPeter Baker: Yes. I mean, these are the mechanisms of accountability of a normal government, right? And he has made very clear by firing the people who held jobs like that, by putting people in, like Pam Bondi and Kash Patel at the Justice Department and the FBI, what his expectations are? His expectations are you're going to go after my enemies and you're not going to go after my friends. And he's done that through the pardons. He has done that through, you know, retribution time and time again.\nWhat happened in his first term when a special counsel was appointed by his own deputy attorney general, and he then spent the rest of his term and ever since then, you know, lambasting, Rod Rosenstein for doing that, for appointing Bob Mueller to look into things. That is not going to happen in this term.\nAnd that's what's so different. Like under Reagan, when they investigated people in the Reagan administration, under Clinton, when they investigated people in the Clinton administration, there were multiple special counsels. Anytime you had a cabinet officer or somebody in there, even the president, do something that was questionable, there was this expectation that you would have a Justice Department appoint special counsel, independent counsel, whichever the structure they used, because you didn't trust the government to investigate itself. And people wanted to have, you know, independent investigation.\nStephen Hayes : There's no expectation that's ever going to happen in the next four years.\nLeigh Ann Caldwell: And he fired the special counsel and then put into place an ally into the special counsel's office, who's only, I think out of law school three years.\nJeffrey Goldberg: So, there was a system here, there's a deliberate --\nPeter Baker: There's a system that will never be used under the next -- in this administration.\nJeffrey Goldberg: Right.\nFROM THIS EPISODE\nClip: How Trump's fight with Harvard is playing politically\nFull Episode: Washington Week with The Atlantic full episode, 5/30/25\n© 1996 - 2025 WETA.

It identifies several important patterns in policymaking over four decades. First, prescription drug coverage has usually been tied to the fate of broader proposals for Medicare reform. Second, action has been hampered by divided government, federal budget deficits, and ideological conflict between those seeking to expand the traditional Medicare program and those preferring a greater role for private health care companies. Third, the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 reflect earlier missed opportunities. Policymakers concluded from past episodes that participation in the new program should be voluntary, with Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers sharing the costs. They ignored lessons from past episodes, however, about the need to match expanded benefits with adequate mechanisms for cost containment. Based on several new circumstances in 2003, the article demonstrates why there was a historic opportunity to add a Medicare prescription drug benefit and identify challenges to implementing an effective policy.\nOn December 8, 2003, President George W. Bush (R) signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (P.L. 108–173), which authorizes Medicare coverage of outpatient prescription drugs as well as a host of other changes to the program. The new drug assistance represents a major new federal entitlement for Medicare beneficiaries, who now spend an average of $2,322 per year on prescription drugs (Kaiser Family Foundation 2003c). The drug assistance and other provisions of the law are projected to cost taxpayers at least $395 billion, and possibly as much as $534 billion, over the next decade (CBO 2004a, 13; CBO 2004b; Pear 2004a). Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), one of the initiative's chief negotiators and political investors, hailed its passage: “Today is a historic day and a momentous day. Seniors have waited 38 years for this prescription drug benefit to be added to the Medicare program. Today they are just moments away from the drug coverage they desperately need and deserve” (Pear and Hulse 2003).\nIn fact, for many Medicare beneficiaries, the benefits of the new law are not so immediate or valuable. By mid-2004, the federal government will authorize cards that can be used to obtain price discounts on prescription drug purchases and will offer a $600 credit to about 4.7 million low-income beneficiaries. In 2006 the full-fledged program is scheduled to begin. At that time, more than 40 million beneficiaries will have the following options: (1) they may keep any private prescription drug coverage they currently have; (2) they may enroll in a new, freestanding prescription drug plan; or (3) they may obtain drug coverage by enrolling in a Medicare managed care plan. Medicare will subsidize the cost of coverage for about 14 million low-income beneficiaries. Other beneficiaries will face significant gaps in coverage and, as a result, will still be liable for up to $3,600 or more in annual expenses.\nIn the wake of this political breakthrough, public opinion on the final product was remarkably negative:\nAfter years of fierce campaigning, lobbying, and legislating over the issue, a landmark agreement finally emerged in Congress this week to provide Medicare prescription drug benefits. Among the key stakeholders in the legislation, there were definite winners and losers. But the group that should have come out on top—America's seniors—was reeling and confused at the prospect of limited help, while watching industry groups count their booty. In fact, members of Congress from both parties contended that some seniors struggling to pay for prescription drugs may actually end up worse off than they are now.\nIn a poll taken in the week that President Bush signed the new Medicare law, 47 percent of senior citizens opposed the changes, and only 26 percent voiced their approval. Among people of all ages who said they were closely following the Medicare debate, 56 percent said they disapproved of the legislation, and 39 percent supported it (ABC News/Washington Post Poll 2003). Their disappointment reflected high expectations as well as the upside-down politics that produced the new reforms:\nEven before Bush's ink on the bill was dry, the two political parties prepared to make the issue a focus of the 2004 elections. Bush, who defied conservatives in the Republican Party by backing a massive increase in a federal program long championed by Democrats, heralded the act as a strengthening of “compassionate government.” And Democrats, calling the legislation inadequate and harmful to many seniors, drafted substantially more generous prescription drug coverage and vowed to “take back our Medicare.”\nWhen observers look back at 2003, they will wonder why it took 38 years to authorize Medicare coverage for such a critical component of modern medicine. Why did political leaders finally agree to address this gap in coverage at this time, and why was that agreement so fraught with controversy? Why did the new outpatient drug benefits under Medicare take the form they did? What issues remain for policymakers to confront in the future? This article attempts to answer each of these questions, as well as to provide a concise history and analysis of the role of prescription drugs in the evolution of Medicare policy. Our intent is to clarify both the contemporary debate over ways to “modernize” Medicare and the factors leading to or inhibiting changes in the program.\nFirst, we review the key episodes related to Medicare and prescription drug coverage. We begin by examining the omission of outpatient prescription drugs from the initial package of Medicare benefits. This incomplete package prompted the development of other sources of coverage—employer retirement programs, privately purchased supplemental benefits (“Medigap”), Medicaid, and managed care plans—which generally deterred subsequent efforts to add prescription drugs to Medicare. We recount the subsequent history of initiatives to introduce Medicare prescription drug benefits, including administrative actions by the Johnson and Nixon administrations, the enactment and repeal of the 1988 Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, President Bill Clinton's proposals for national health care reform, the deliberations of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, proposals before and after the 2000 presidential election, and the adoption of prescription drug coverage and other reforms in late 2003 (see Table 1). This history reveals that from the late 1960s to the late 1990s, prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries was always linked to the fate of other proposals for health care reform and that only at the end of the Clinton administration did the issue take on a life of its own.\nTABLE 1.\n| Proposal | Participation | Monthly Premium | Deductible | Coinsurance | Drug Discount Card |

improve prescription drug coverage in Medicare. Based on the work of John Kingdon (1995), we describe how and why opportunities for policy change arose and explain why there was an extraordinary political window of opportunity in 2003. Our analysis confirms that political and economic forces outside Medicare have as much or more influence on policies as do conditions inside the Medicare program itself. Shifts in control of the presidency and the Congress create or close down opportunities for reform and, in addition, dictate what kinds of Medicare reform are possible. Another important contextual factor is the nearly perennial federal budget deficit, which grew dramatically after President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in the early 1980s and had a dominant influence on Medicare policies until the short-lived budget surpluses of the late 1990s.\nWe build on the work of Paul Sabatier and Hank Jenkins-Smith (1993) to explain how ideological conflict over the role of government created nearly insurmountable barriers to Medicare reform over the past decade. The ideological shift in the Republican Party, which was first manifested in the 1970s and became more dramatic after the 1994 congressional elections, has transformed much of Medicare policymaking from a deliberative, bipartisan process into a highly polarized, deadlocked debate. Despite the clear opportunity for policy change in 2003, it took all the resources and tactical maneuvering of the president and other Republican leaders, as well as favors for key constituencies, to overcome ideological misgivings and secure political agreement for a complex package of reforms.\nToday's problems and policy options are in part “legacies” of earlier decisions and non-decisions. Based on the work of Mark Peterson (1997), we demonstrate how the reform proposals of 2003 reflected not only the primary problems facing beneficiaries today but also the lessons learned from earlier episodes by beneficiaries, interest groups, and government officials. The chief legacies reflected in the design of the new program are that participation is voluntary and that the costs will be shared by the Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers, rather than borne entirely by the beneficiaries themselves. In addition, policymakers went to great lengths to ensure that the new prescription drug benefits will be administered principally by private companies and not by the federal government. Since the history of Medicare demonstrates that expansion of the federal regulatory role is nearly inevitable, the pharmaceutical industry has long anticipated similar controls in any Medicare prescription drug program and strongly resisted a benefit that would be centrally administered by the federal government.\nMissed Opportunities for a Prescription Drug Benefit\nThe Enactment of Medicare in 1965\nThe limited scope of the original Medicare benefits reflects the beating that President Harry Truman (D) took at the hands of the American Medical Association (AMA) after he introduced proposals for national health insurance between 1945 and 1948 and again after his election in 1948. The AMA launched a very well-funded and bitter attack on “socialized medicine” to defeat Truman and his congressional allies even after the Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1949 (Marmor 2000, 6–15; Starr 1982, 280–9).\nIn 1951 the idea of a health insurance program for the elderly was initially proposed by Oscar Ewing, head of the Federal Security Administration. Between 1958 and 1965, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee held annual hearings on proposals to offer hospital insurance for the elderly. The hearings provided a battleground for pressure groups with deeply differing ideological views of the role of the federal government in any aspect of medical care (Marmor 2000, 17). When the 1964 election produced a landslide victory for President Lyndon Johnson (D) and the largest Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress since the 1936 election, the enactment of new medical assistance for the aged was no longer in doubt. This major shift in legislative power and President Johnson's activist social policy agenda led to the prompt enactment of Medicare in the spring of 1965.\nThe main Democratic proposal supported by the Johnson administration, the King-Anderson bill, was intended only to cover many of the costs of hospitalization through a universal social insurance mechanism. The counterproposal offered by Republicans, the Byrnes bill, called for voluntary enrollment in a health insurance program financed by premiums paid by the beneficiaries and subsidized by general revenues. It had more benefits, including physician services and prescription drugs. In addition, the AMA proposed a state-based, means-tested program of comprehensive benefits to expand the Kerr-Mills program for impoverished seniors first enacted in 1960.\nRepresentative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, made the surprise suggestion that the Democratic and Republican proposals essentially be combined into Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, a new Medicare program with two parts, A (hospital insurance) and B (supplementary medical insurance). President Johnson supported this proposal. As the Ways and Means Committee marked up the combined bill in March 1965 (and also added what would become Medicaid), the outpatient prescription drug benefit for Part B was dropped “on the grounds of unpredictable and potentially high costs” (Marmor 2000, 49).\nThus, despite the overwhelming Democratic majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as nominal Republican support for such a benefit, the first of many opportunities to cover Medicare beneficiaries for the costs of outpatient prescription drugs ended in failure. The Medicaid program, enacted as Title XIX of the Social Security Act, ended up providing far more comprehensive coverage for the indigent elderly, blind, disabled, and families with dependent children. It included outpatient prescription drug coverage as an optional benefit, which all the states elected to offer when they set up their Medicaid programs.\nIt would be wrong to conclude that an outpatient drug benefit was omitted because the cost of prescription drugs in 1965 was negligible. In fact, prescription drugs accounted for nearly the same proportion of national health spending in the early 1960s (10 percent) as they do today (11 percent), even with the recent rapid increases in prices and utilization (Cowan et al. 1999, 190; Levit et al. 2004, 155). It was hospital costs that were far less predictable and potentially devastating to the individual retiree, and for that reason, they were the priority for the architects of Medicare from the outset. Thus, while outpatient prescription drug coverage was a limited feature of many private health insurance plans, it was never incorporated into the main Democratic proposals during Medicare's long gestation.\nFrom the outset, Medicare did cover those prescription drugs that were dispensed in the physician's office and not self-administered by the patient. This limited benefit was designed to keep physicians from hospitalizing a patient just for a needed drug. The expansion of Medicare coverage to patients with end-stage renal disease in 1972 led to high costs associated with the erythropoetin used to treat the anemia common in these patients. Later, more drugs that could be administered in a physician's office were added, including immunosuppressive drugs to treat cancer and to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs. In the 1990s Congress authorized coverage for orally administered drugs for cancer (MedPac 2003). Members of Congress routinely added amendments mandating Medicare coverage for specific drugs on behalf of pharmaceutical, medical device, and biotechnology companies in their districts (Pear 1999). By 2001, Medicare covered approximately 454 physician-dispensed prescription drugs at a cost of $6.5 billion per year, up from just $700 million in 1992 (Dummit 2002).\nThe explosive growth in the costs of these drugs caught the attention of policymakers. The inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) found that Medicare paid between two and ten times more than the price advertised to doctors by drug companies (U.S. DHHS 2001c). As Thomas Scully, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, testified, “It is clear that Medicare's payment system for those covered drugs, based on average wholesale price, is seriously flawed” (Scully 2002). Congress gave Medicare statutory authority to set payments based on “inherent reasonableness” in 1997 but then, presumably in response to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry and physicians, suspended regulatory development in 1999. When it came time to add outpatient prescription drug benefits to Medicare in 2003, however, Congress instituted new payment methods for physician-administered drugs even while it assiduously avoided price controls for the broader benefit package.\nThe Task Force on Prescription Drugs\nSoon after Medicare was implemented, unexpected increases in the program's spending on hospital and physician services drew the attention of officials in the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW; later renamed Health and Human Services) and the White House. The particular policies that contributed to the early and rapid rise of Medicare expenditures were the cost-based reimbursement of hospitals and the payment of physicians based on “customary, prevailing, and reasonable charges” (Oliver 1993, 116; PPRC 1987, 4). When President Johnson was faced with proposals to expand Medicare—precisely what its original supporters had anticipated—it seems likely that he did not want to add even more to the program's rapidly rising costs. In the fall of 1967, for example, he would not agree to support a proposal, called KiddyCare, from HEW to provide Medicare coverage for pregnant women and children (Gordon 2003, 29).\nBy calling for a careful assessment, the president could lessen the immediate political pressure to add a prescription drug benefit. In May 1967 HEW Secretary John Gardner established the Task Force on Prescription Drugs in response to a directive from President Johnson “to undertake immediately a comprehensive study of the problems of including the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare” (Gardner 1967). Congress also weighed in on the issue. Section 405(a) of the 1967 amendments to the Social Security Act included the following provision: “The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is authorized and directed to study … quality and cost standards for drugs for which payments are made under the Social Security Act, and … the coverage of drugs under Part B of Title XVIII of such Act” (Cohen 1968). The task force was required to submit its findings and conclusions by January 1, 1969. It functioned for 20 months and studied all who would be affected by the policy, including drug users, drug makers, drug distributors, and drug prescribers.\nThe task force found that all out-of-hospital prescription drug use, prices, and expenditures had risen rapidly between 1950 and 1965. The number of prescriptions had climbed from 363 million in 1950 to 833 million in 1965 to 930 million in 1967. The number of prescriptions per capita had almost doubled from 2.40 to 4.75, and expenditures had risen from $736 million in 1950 to $3.25 billion in 1967. Moreover, the burden of prescription drug use fell disproportionately on the elderly, who incurred 47 percent of the total costs (U.S. DHEW 1968b, 15–29).\nInformation about insurance coverage was difficult to obtain, but it appeared that only a small percentage of Medicare beneficiaries had any coverage of prescription drugs outside the hospital. The task force noted that although most large and small insurance companies offered out-of-hospital prescription drug benefits under the heading of general medical expenses, “this type of protection is so limited by restrictions—including coinsurance regulations, maximum amounts payable, and deductibles of $100, $250 or even $500—that its impact appears to be minimal. In addition, many such policies are restricted to those under the age of 65” (U.S. DHEW 1968a, 116).\nThe prospect of extending Medicare prescription drug coverage to patients outside the hospital raised several issues, including how to control the costs of such a program. In striking a balance between a comprehensive benefit and economic viability, policymakers struggled with many issues that are as salient today as they were in 1967. These included (1) drug prices, (2) formularies, (3) drug utilization review (to ensure the appropriateness of prescriptions for the patient's condition, to reduce unnecessary care, and to promote cost-effectiveness), (4) consumer cost sharing, and (5) reimbursement of pharmacists (U.S. DHEW 1969b).\nThe final report of the Task Force on Prescription Drugs was submitted on February 7, 1969, to Robert Finch, the secretary of HEW newly appointed by President Richard Nixon (R). Perhaps its most significant finding was that “a drug insurance program under Medicare is needed by the elderly, and would be both economically and medically feasible.” The task force recommended that such a program be instituted and, in addition, that “consideration should be given to providing coverage at the outset mainly for those drugs which are most likely to be essential in the treatment of seniors’ illnesses” (U.S. DHEW 1969b, 57). These recommendations were not adopted, however, and Medicare coverage of prescription drugs was not considered again as an independent issue until 1999, 30 years later.\nPrescription Drug Policies in the Nixon Administration\nFollowing submission of the task force's report, Secretary Finch appointed a review committee headed by John Dunlop of Harvard University, the former chair of President Nixon's health transition team who had been appointed secretary of labor. The committee convened in April and submitted its report on July 23, 1969. With only one dissenting voice from a representative of the pharmaceutical manufacturers, the committee endorsed a number of the task force's recommendations. In particular, “the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare should recommend an Administration decision for an out-of-hospital drug insurance program under Medicare” (U.S. DHEW 1969a, 4).\nSecretary Finch acted on a number of the review committee's recommendations, but the Nixon administration did not endorse an outpatient prescription drug benefit for the Medicare program. Even though measures to provide an outpatient prescription drug benefit were proposed in Congress, none was enacted. In January 1971 President Nixon introduced his first proposal for national health insurance. When the proposal was finalized at a meeting of the president, HEW secretary Eliot Richardson, and Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation Lewis Butler, the issue of prescription drug coverage in Medicare was raised at the request of Commissioner of Social Security Robert Ball. President Nixon stated, “We have done as much as we need to do,” and that was the end of the discussion (Butler 2002). In lieu of expanding benefits, in 1972 Congress extended eligibility for Medicare to the permanently disabled and to individuals with end-stage renal disease.\nIn 1973 actions initiated by another HEW secretary, Caspar Weinberger, set in motion political forces that would make it more difficult to establish a prescription drug benefit in Medicare. On December 19 of that year, Secretary Weinberger praised the work of the Task Force on Prescription Drugs before the Senate Health Subcommittee chaired by Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He described the task force's operations as “landmarks in the consideration of prescription drug issues.” Weinberger outlined the steps taken by HEW to implement many of the task force's recommendations and then dropped what a trade publication called “a bombshell.” Specifically, Weinberger proposed regulations to limit drug reimbursement under existing federal programs—the largest of which was Medicaid—to “the lowest cost at which the drug is generally available unless there is a demonstrated difference in therapeutic effect” (Silverman and Lee 1974, 168).\nThe proposed regulations were very similar to those recommended by the task force in 1969. Such a policy stemming from a Republican administration came as a surprise, however, and illustrated how concerned policymakers were about rising medical costs. Weinberger's announcement touched the pharmaceutical industry's most sensitive nerves, endorsing generic substitutes for brand-name products and limits on reimbursement. Despite vigorous industry opposition, state laws were already changing to allow pharmacists to substitute cheaper, generic drugs for brand-name products. Now the federal government was adopting similar methods.\nAlthough it had only a limited effect on the aggregate expenditures for drugs, the new policy nevertheless aroused a vehement response from both the drug industry and pharmacists. The pharmacists’ opposition was particularly strong because it was more profitable to dispense brand-name drugs than generics. In the end, lawsuits and bitter disputes about HEW's methods for setting reimbursement levels slowed and later limited implementation of the program. After many delays, the regulations were revised in 1983, replacing complicated procedures for determining the “maximum allowable cost” and simply setting upper limits on prescription drug expenditures in state Medicaid programs.\nIn addition to its efforts to control federal spending on prescription drugs, the Nixon administration imposed general wage and price controls and maintained them for health services well after easing them in other industries. It pursued these regulatory policies even as it also proposed federal investment in health maintenance organizations and national health insurance based on “structured competition” (Brown 1983; Falkson 1980; Fleming 1973). This combination of initiatives illustrates two persistent themes in federal health care policy. First, concern over rising costs has been a major driver of policy, and Republicans often subordinate their market-oriented ideology when regulatory interventions can achieve more predictable cost control. Second, federal officials from both political parties give the highest priority to containing the budgets of existing programs, not to rationalizing the broader U.S. health care system (Marmor 2000, 116–7; Oberlander 2003, 123; Oliver 1991, 473; Oliver 1993, 132). The pharmaceutical industry was not yet a powerful political force, but it drew from this episode the lesson that price controls would likely accompany any federal sponsorship of prescription drug coverage. The industry's resistance to price controls would become a formidable barrier when subsequent opportunities to add drug benefits to Medicare arose.\nThe Long Wait for New Benefits\nMore than a decade passed before there was another major effort to introduce prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Even though the Democrats controlled both the legislative and executive branches of government in the wake of the Watergate scandal and the election of President Jimmy Carter (D) in 1976, the energy crisis, a weak economy, and rising inflation precluded costly new initiatives (Starr 1982, 411). Inflation and growing unemployment were threatening the solvency of Social Security, and Congress responded by raising payroll taxes in 1977. Richard Himelfarb observed that\nthe economic troubles of this period transformed the politics of federal programs serving the elderly. Whereas the 1960s and early 1970s had been marked by significant expansion of federal aid to the aged, the late 1970s and 1980s constituted an era of scarcity in which public officials struggled to maintain the gains of an earlier era. In short, from the Carter years onward, legislators would face no more “easy votes” on programs affecting the elderly. (1995, 5)\nAlthough President Carter had promised to pursue national health insurance, during his first year in office he turned his attention instead to containing soaring hospital costs (Starr 1982, 411–4). His proposals in 1977 and 1979 died in Congress amid criticism that they were excessively complex and regulatory, but the issue continued to dominate federal health policy until Congress accepted the Reagan administration's proposals in 1982 and 1983 to establish a prospective payment system for Medicare hospital services (Oliver 1991). Throughout the rest of the 1980s Congress devoted considerable energy to reforming Medicare's payment system for physicians (Oliver 1993; Smith 1992).\nThe reason for the lack of a focus on prescription drug coverage, therefore, was the more pressing financial problems inside and outside health care. Even though prescription drug prices were increasing rapidly during this period, spending on other health services was growing even more rapidly. As a result, prescription drug costs as a share of total health spending declined from 10 percent in 1960 to 4.7 percent in 1982. Between 1982 and 1993, their share of total health spending increased only from 4.7 to 5.6 percent (Cowan et al. 1999, 190). It was not until after 1993 that drug prices and utilization quickly accelerated and became a focal issue for policymakers. So even when an opportunity to add drug coverage to Medicare arose in the latter part of the Reagan administration, the primary goal once again was to protect beneficiaries from the even higher costs of hospital and physician services.\nThe Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988\nThe Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA) began with the 1984 report of the Social Security Advisory Council chaired by Otis Bowen, a physician and former Republican governor of Indiana. The council's report did not focus on prescription drugs but on the limited hospital coverage provided by Medicare and the out-of-pocket expenses for both hospital and physician services. After Bowen was appointed as secretary of HHS by President Ronald Reagan (R) in November 1985, he urged the White House to support the council's reform proposals and successfully lobbied for an initial proposal in the 1986 State of the Union address. The combination of Bowen's interest and changes in the political climate—the Iran/contra scandal in the White House and Democrats’ regain of control of the Senate after the 1986 election, along with their continuing control of the House of Representatives—soon created the opportunity for new Medicare benefits, among them prescription drug coverage (Fuchs and Hoadley 1987; Himelfarb 1995; Moon 1993; Rovner 1995).\nThe initial version of the MCCA capped beneficiaries’ total out-of-pocket expenses and modestly expanded Medicare's Part B coverage of physician and other outpatient services. As the legislation was being crafted in 1987–88, members of Congress added provisions for hospice care, home health care, mammography screening, state payments of Medicare deductibles and premiums for elderly with incomes below the poverty line, and protection against spousal impoverishment from nursing home expenses. The benefits were included in order to gain the support of Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), the chairman of the House Rules Committee and a champion of senior citizens, who wanted to fill as many of Medicare's coverage gaps as possible, including long-term care (Himelfarb 1995, 27; Rovner 1995, 157).\nDespite considerable uncertainty over the costs, Representative Henry Waxman (D-Cal.) succeeded in adding outpatient prescription drug coverage at the urging of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), who saw it as “a way to put a Democratic stamp on what had been a Reagan initiative” (Himelfarb 1995, 29). The prescription drug benefit emerged as the pivotal proposal for the MCCA. The 28-million-member American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) would endorse the legislation only if it included a drug benefit. Conversely, senior officials in the Reagan administration, including Secretary Bowen, threatened a veto if prescription drugs were included. In addition, in mid-1987 the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association spent $3 million on a campaign to derail the proposal (Rovner 1995, 160).\nIn the spring of 1988 the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), proved to be the final arbiter when he accepted a drug benefit “scaled back to catastrophic coverage and not a routine benefit.” Medicare would cover 80 percent of drug costs once the beneficiary met a $600 deductible. The administration, weakened by scandal, did not have the will to fight over prescription drugs, and it ultimately supported the final package (Himelfarb 1995, 29–31).\nIn June 1988 the Senate and the House of Representatives resolved the differences in their bills, with coverage for prescription drugs incorporated into the MCCA. With the AARP's cooperation and enthusiastic support, the new law passed both houses of Congress with large, bipartisan majorities (328 to 72 in the House and 86 to 11 in the Senate), and the president signed it into law as P.L. 100–360. It was the first major expansion of benefits since the creation of Medicare in 1965.\nPresident Reagan had agreed to support the legislation if it added nothing to the deficit. He added a further condition that the benefits would have to be self-financed, paid entirely by Medicare beneficiaries (Rovner 1995, 154). Democratic leaders in Congress accepted the concept of “user fees” because they were reluctant to raise general taxes heading into the 1988 presidential election (Himelfarb 1995, 34). But this position had profound consequences for the ensuing design of the MCCA and its poor political reception. The prescription drug benefits led to a dramatic increase in the cost of the program and were thus a major source of the ensuing problems.\nTo pay for the new benefits, legislators increased, after much debate, the monthly Part B premium (about $28 at the time) for all Medicare beneficiaries by $4.00. In addition, all beneficiaries who paid more than $150 in federal income taxes would pay a “supplemental premium” of 15 percent on the amount of tax they owed, capped at $800 for individuals and $1,600 for couples. This was done for pragmatic reasons, to help cover the costs of the new benefits and to keep the program “budget neutral,” and also because many policymakers accepted the principle that financial contributions should be based on a person's ability to pay and should not unduly burden low-income seniors (Himelfarb 1995, 34–7).\nThe progressive financing proved to be the Achilles’ heel of the MCCA, however. It meant that one-third of the elderly population—those with higher incomes—would be paying for more than two-thirds of the cost of the new benefits. Many upper-income elderly already had outpatient prescription drug coverage—through employer retirement programs and, to a lesser extent, through Medigap policies—but because the new coverage was mandatory, they had no choice but to participate (Newhouse 2002, 943). In the eyes of many beneficiaries and advocacy groups, furthermore, the income-related premium violated the original social contract, under which individuals earned benefits during their working years and so would not have to pay for added benefits during their retirement; and all seniors would have the same set of benefits from and financial obligations to the Medicare program. They feared that this method of financing might become a “back door” precedent to more general forms of means testing in social insurance programs (Himelfarb 1995, 36).\nThe large majority of beneficiaries who would gain from the MCCA—the low- and middle-income elderly—did not rally to support it despite favorable opinion polls before its enactment and the prominent endorsement by the AARP. Instead, the negative reaction to the legislation was broad based: The AARP found opposition to the MCCA among all income groups (Himelfarb 1995, 72; Rice, Desmond, and Gabel 1990). One reason was that the program still failed to pay for long-term custodial nursing home care. As Julie Rovner noted, “In 1988 Medicare paid less than two percent of the nation's nursing home bill. And as both supporters and opponents of the Catastrophic Coverage Act were quick to point out, long term care was by far the leading cause of catastrophic medical expense for elderly people” (Rovner 1995, 149). More important, seniors were unaware of or were misled about how limited the impact of the supplemental premium would be. The maximum payment would take effect at an annual income of $45,000 for individuals and $75,000 for couples. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that only 36 percent of beneficiaries would pay any supplemental premium at the start of the program and that only 5 percent would pay the maximum amount (Himelfarb 1995, 40).\nA public campaign for repeal of the MCCA was led by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, joined by a 40-group coalition of unions and other groups and several grassroots organizations (Himelfarb 1995, 73–81; Rovner 1995, 167). Defenders of the MCCA alleged, but never proved conclusively, that the pharmaceutical industry helped organize and fund the campaign for repeal (Moon 1993; Rovner 1995, 168). The campaign illustrated the power of “ breed lobbying,” which, Hedrick Smith found, “borrows heavily from the techniques of political campaigns with their slick P.R., television advertising, orchestrated coalitions, targeted mass mailings, and their crowds of activists” (Smith 1988, 236). The same approach was used by other interest groups to defeat the Clinton health security plan in 1994.\nSupporters of the legislation were even less inclined to resist the calls for repeal when the Congressional Budget Office released new projections showing that the costs of the MCCA—and thus the beneficiaries’ costs if the program were to remain self-financing—were now expected to be far higher than the projections made before its enactment (Himelfarb 1995, 89; Moon 1993, 125). After weighing several proposals to modify the scope of benefits or elderly-only financing, Congress repealed most of the MCCA's major provisions in November 1989, including the prescription drug benefit. The entire episode left a powerful impression on chastened policymakers and on the AARP, which could no longer be counted on as a unified voice for Medicare beneficiaries.\nPrescription Drug Coverage in the Health Security Act\nThe next opportunity to add an outpatient prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program came in 1993 as part of the health security act proposed by President Bill Clinton (D). Adding a Medicare drug benefit was good policy and good politics: It would be extraordinarily difficult to guarantee comprehensive health benefits, including drugs, to all Americans under age 65 and not to do the same for senior citizens and the disabled, whose needs were generally higher. A new drug benefit might also rally the support of Medicare beneficiaries for the Clinton plan, or at least neutralize potential opposition, given that the plan called for savings in other parts of Medicare as a way to help pay for coverage of uninsured persons under age 65.\nThe proposed expansion of the Medicare program would include an outpatient prescription drug and biologics benefit as well as a guaranteed national benefits package for those under the age of 65. The Medicare drug benefit would become part of Part B, adding $11 per month to the premium. Beneficiaries would pay a $250 annual deductible and 20 percent of the cost of each prescription up to an annual maximum of $1,000. Low-income beneficiaries would receive assistance with cost sharing.\nIn the report describing the health security act, the Clinton administration made clear its strategy to contain the cost of the prescription drug benefit:\nUnder reform, with the addition of prescription drug coverage, Medicare will become the world's largest purchaser of drugs. And, the Medicare program will use its negotiating power to get discounts from the pharmaceutical companies. In addition, with competing health plans trying to become more efficient, more and more buyers will use the same successful negotiating techniques.\n(Health Security 1993, 55)\nThe administration proposed that as a condition of participation in Medicare and Medicaid, drug manufacturers had to sign rebate agreements with the secretary of HHS, to be paid on a quarterly basis. For brand-name products, Medicare would receive rebates from manufacturers of at least 17 percent of average retail prices. The government could negotiate rebates for new drugs considered to be overpriced, or it could exclude them from coverage (Ford et al. 1994, 75–6). An additional rebate would be required if a manufacturer increased its prices at a rate higher than inflation. The Clinton plan also provided incentives to encourage the use of generic drugs. The benefit would cover only generic drugs unless the physician indicated that a brand-name prescription drug was required. These provisions reflected the policymakers’ judgment that it was necessary to use a regulatory approach to control prescription drug expenditures even when the broader approach to containing costs in the proposed health security act emphasized “managed competition.”\nThe Clinton plan and other major proposals for health reform died in September 1994, losing public support under a withering attack from conservatives and interest groups, who claimed that it was too complex, would ration health care, and represented too much “government bureaucracy” (Hacker 1997; Johnson and Broder 1996; Skocpol 1996). Although the defeat of President Clinton's proposed reforms was not directly related to the prescription drug coverage, the provisions exacerbated concerns among pharmaceutical firms that drug benefits would be accompanied by price controls and other regulation of industry practices (Newhouse 2002, 943).\nNational Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare\nFollowing the failure of President Clinton's health care reform proposal in 1994, Republicans captured majorities in both houses of Congress. In 1995 the main policy issue regarding Medicare was not how to improve benefits but how to restructure the program and limit the federal government's financial liability for existing coverage. The Medicare Preservation Act, which Congress passed as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 but President Clinton vetoed, included major reforms and reductions in spending in Medicare and other government programs as well as substantial tax cuts. Republican strategists miscalculated both the president's willingness to accept the legislation and the public's reaction (Peterson 1998). Nonetheless, reducing the budget deficit remained a high political priority, and two years later, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Balanced Budget Act) cut projected Medicare spending by $115 billion over five years and by $385 billion over ten years (Etheredge 1998; Oberlander 2003, 177–83).\nThe Balanced Budget Act created a new Medicare+Choice (Part C) program, which encouraged beneficiaries to choose among the traditional fee-for-service Medicare, HMOs, and preferred-provider organizations. It also created Medicare medical savings accounts, changed payment policies and formulas for providers and health plans, strengthened efforts to prevent and prosecute fraud and abuse by Medicare providers, and created the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.\nAccording to David Smith, the bipartisan commission was included in the Balanced Budget Act, “primarily as a concession to members in both houses who were concerned that not enough had been done to assure the long-term solvency of the Medicare program, especially with the enormous drain that would be created by the retirement of the baby boom generation, rising medical expenditures, and a declining ratio of contributors to beneficiaries” (Smith 2002, 350). One brief sentence directed the commission to “make recommendations regarding a comprehensive approach to preserve the program.” The expectations were low, since there was little more than a year to hire staff, establish an agenda, write reports, and make recommendations.\nThe commission met from 1998 to 1999 and included members of Congress and current or former executive branch officials. As the commission concluded its work in March 1999, it considered recommendations in three major areas: (1) establishing a system of “premium support,” under which the government would contribute a fixed amount of money toward each beneficiary's coverage in either a private health plan or the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program and would no longer cover specific benefits regardless of cost; private plans would have to offer a “high option” with a benefits package at least equal to the fee-for-service program but otherwise could vary benefits, copayments, and deductibles subject to approval by a new Medicare governing board; (2) improving the current Medicare program, including a prescription drug benefit for beneficiaries with incomes below 135 percent of poverty; and (3) changing eligibility and financing to improve the program's long-term solvency (National Bipartisan Commission 1999; Smith 2002, 351).\nThe commission had 17 members from both Congress and the private sector, representing a wide ideological spectrum. Under the legislative mandate that the Clinton White House insisted on, 11 affirmative votes were required to make any recommendations to Congress. Ten members (eight Republicans and two Democrats) supported a range of recommendations, including moving to a system of premium support, raising the age for Medicare eligibility from 65 to 67, and expanding copayments to help contain costs (Oberlander 2003, 188; Smith 2002, 351; Vladeck 1999a). In trying to attract one more vote, the majority added a prescription drug benefit to their plan. The benefit was extremely limited, however: It would be required only for “high option” fee-for-service and managed care plans and would not include price controls or limits on cost sharing other than a catastrophic limit. Most important, it did not offer a general subsidy for beneficiaries with incomes above 135 percent of the poverty level, and the cost of the drug benefit was to be absorbed by higher premiums or savings elsewhere in the benefits package (Smith 2002, 352). Other proposals were introduced into the bargaining, but in the end, the commissioners regarded as potential swing votes held back, sensing that the final plan failed to strike a fair balance among beneficiaries, providers, and health plans. None of the recommendations received the required 11 votes, and the commission was unable to submit a formal report to Congress (Oberlander 2003, 189).\nWhile the structural reform proposed by the commission's cochairmen, Senator John Breaux (D-La.) and Representative Bill Thomas (R-Cal.), languished, the commission debate revived the idea of filling Medicare's gaps and indirectly encouraged a flurry of proposals by members of Congress, President Clinton, and later President George W. Bush to add an outpatient prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. This paradoxical outcome—that structural reform would falter and proposals for adding prescription drug coverage would take on a life of their own—was the product of several new conditions inside and outside Medicare. First, the payment reforms of the Balanced Budget Act and an accompanying crackdown on fraud led to an unprecedented slowdown in the growth of Medicare spending. Indeed, in 1999, Medicare spending actually declined for the first time in the program's history (CBO 2004a, 137). Second, economic prosperity and the booming stock market erased the annual federal budget deficits and produced sizable budget surpluses for the first time in decades. From fiscal year (FY) 1998 through FY2001, annual surpluses ranged from $69 billion to $236 billion (CBO 2004a, 129). These two developments extended the projected life of the Part A hospital trust fund from 2001 to 2029 and greatly reduced the pressure to seek further efficiencies in Medicare. Third, each year brought double-digit increases in the cost of prescription drugs, adding to the financial burden of beneficiaries and prompting many employers to cut back or eliminate coverage for their retirees (Kaiser Family Foundation and Hewitt Associates 2002; Strunk and Ginsburg 2003; Stuart et al. 2003). Finally, in the 1990s several million Medicare beneficiaries joined managed care plans. The growth of Medicare HMOs was due in part to a requirement that those plans whose per capita costs were significantly below the fee-for-service program (because of either greater efficiency or favorable risk selection) had to add benefits or return a portion of their capitation payments to Medicare. Accordingly, many plans reduced or eliminated cost sharing for their enrollees and added prescription drugs and other popular benefits. The beneficiaries, in turn, cited lower costs or better benefits as their primary reasons for enrolling in a Medicare HMO (CMS 2002, 8).\nThe growing availability of coverage in managed care plans, coupled with the projected budget surpluses, made it more necessary to answer why the government could not help cover prescription drug costs for all beneficiaries. The political pressure to expand coverage only grew as many private insurers started to withdraw from the Medicare+Choice program in 1999, leaving millions of beneficiaries to shop elsewhere for prescription drug benefits—if they could afford them (Laschober et al. 2002). In addition, those plans that remained in the Medicare program dramatically cut back their prescription drug coverage as the price of medications continued to escalate. Between 1999 and 2003 the percentage of Medicare+Choice plans offering more than $750 in drug benefits (only one-third of the average costs per beneficiary) fell from 79 percent to 39 percent (Achman and Gold 2003).\nThe new proposals also reflected a change in the political environment. The AARP's chief lobbyist, John Rother, noted: “The public is already strongly supportive. Majorities of younger as well as older Americans support expanding Medicare to include prescription drugs, even given higher total costs for Medicare” (Rother 1999, 21). In contrast to past episodes, by 1999 the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) was not unalterably opposed to prescription drug benefits under Medicare. Instead, the industry group publicly advocated a prescription drug benefit “as part of a Medicare program that is modernized to allow beneficiaries to choose among qualified private-sector health plans” (Holmer 1999, 24). While PhRMA's support appeared to be contingent on the transformation of Medicare into a premium support program, industry leaders probably recognized that if some drug benefits were on the horizon, it would be better to help craft those benefits than to oppose them outright.\nThe Impasse before and after the 2000 Presidential Election\nIn the wake of the bipartisan commission's deliberations, Senator Breaux and Representative Thomas joined Senator Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) on a series of proposals to include a prescription drug benefit as essentially an inducement for beneficiaries to shift from the traditional fee-for-service program to a private health plan. More liberal and moderate members of Congress introduced proposals for an independent outpatient prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program.\nIn addition, in his 1999 State of the Union address, President Clinton proposed his own plan for a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit available to all Medicare beneficiaries. A new Part D drug benefit premium would be established, providing subsidies for low-income beneficiaries with incomes below 150 percent of poverty. This plan introduced the idea of combining modest benefits for most if not all beneficiaries with “stop-loss” protection for the relatively few enrollees with catastrophic costs. Medicare would cover 50 percent of an enrollee's first $5,000 in annual drug spending and 100 percent of any additional expenses (National Economic Council 1999, 39).\nThe most significant difference between the 1999 Clinton proposal and the one considered in 1993–94 as part of the health security act was that participants would receive prescription drug benefits through existing health plans or through a regional pharmacy benefit manager operated by retail drug chains, health insurers, states, or other qualified entities and selected by Medicare through competitive bidding. By 1999, pharmacy benefit managers served about half of the insured population in the United States and performed the following functions: (1) claims processing and adjudication, (2) pharmacy network management, (3) formulary development and management, and (4) rebate negotiations and contracting with drug manufacturers (Copeland 1999; Lipton et al. 1999). Unlike the earlier Clinton proposal, this one relied on the private sector's management and competition to control costs, not direct governmental regulation.\nThe issue of a Medicare drug benefit became a prominent issue in the 2000 presidential campaign, as all the major candidates proposed some version of a new benefit. Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, proposed a new voluntary benefit within Medicare to protect chronically ill or low-income beneficiaries against catastrophic expenses. Texas governor George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, advocated a new federal subsidy to help low-income beneficiaries purchase drug coverage through private insurers.\nIt is noteworthy that all the proposals in 1999–2000 were made in the context of a projected federal budget surplus and assumed that funds would be committed to bolster the long-range solvency of Social Security and Medicare. But this quickly changed with the economic downturn in 2001 and the trillion-dollar tax cut promoted by President Bush and enacted by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2001.\nIn his initial budget for FY2002 submitted to Congress in February 2001, President Bush proposed that $153 billion be allocated over ten years for “Medicare modernization,” including prescription drug assistance (to put this in perspective, Medicare spent a total of $238 billion in FY2001 with no outpatient drug coverage). The president proposed creating a block grant to the states to help provide drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries with incomes up to 175 percent of the poverty level and to provide catastrophic coverage to limit annual out-of-pocket spending to $6,000 for beneficiaries at all income levels. In July 2001, the Bush administration added a plan for Medicare beneficiaries to buy prescription drugs at discounted prices through private pharmacy benefit managers (U.S. DHHS 2001a). The firms endorsed by the Medicare program would negotiate prices with manufacturers and pass along the savings to their cardholders. The administration argued that the program “will help seniors immediately while a Medicare drug benefit is designed” (U.S. DHHS 2001b). It claimed that the program could be implemented without congressional action and be fully operational by January 2002. It did not announce estimates of expected savings from the program.\nThe initiatives stalled when the courts found that the administration had no legal authority for the drug discount program and Congress failed to endorse any form of drug assistance (Pear and Bumiller 2003). Legislators in both parties opposed the concept of block grants, wary that Medicare beneficiaries would resent means testing, state-by-state variation in benefits, and especially the need for beneficiaries to go through welfare agencies to enroll in state Medicaid programs. Focus groups conducted by Republican and Democratic polling firms confirmed that regardless of party affiliation, most Medicare beneficiaries preferred that prescription drug coverage be administered by the federal Medicare program rather than by private health plans or state programs (Public Opinion Strategies 2001).\nAnother reason for the deadlock was that the amount proposed in the president's budget was only one-tenth of what the Congressional Budget Office projected that the Medicare population would spend on prescription drugs during that period. Heading into the 2002 election, Democrats reasoned that no benefit was better than an inadequate benefit.\nA final reason for the deadlock was that once the Bush tax cuts were enacted in mid-2001, Democrats briefly gained majority control of the Senate when James Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent. Thus, Senate Democrats were able to stop Republican leaders in Congress from working out a plan with the White House and claiming victory before the 2002 election. But the switch in the Senate only increased the partisan tensions that remained from the controversial election of President Bush and the subsequent shift of his administration from moderate to conservative rhetoric and policies.\nIn May 2002 Republicans in the House of Representatives and Democrats in the Senate announced competing proposals to add an outpatient prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program (Pear 2002). The estimated ten-year cost of the Republicans’ plan was $350 billion, the same amount settled upon in the FY2002 budget resolution. In contrast, the cost of the Senate Democrats’ final proposal was close to $600 billion. All the congressional proposals were considerably more generous than President Bush's 2002 proposal for a Medicare prescription drug benefit.\nBecause the Senate had not passed a budget resolution for FY2003, members were held to the $350 billion limit for Medicare reform from the previous year's budget resolution, when the chamber was controlled by the Republicans. Any proposal to spend more than that could be challenged on a point of order by any member. It would take 60 votes to suspend the budget rules and permit a vote on the Democratic plan. In the end, the House passed its $350 billion plan by a narrow margin of 221 to 208, but the Senate voted down three separate proposals (Goldstein and Dewar 2002; Goldstein and Eilperin 2002).\nThe End of the Political Deadlock\nThe congressional elections in November 2002 produced a political alignment not seen since the 1950s: Republicans were now in charge of the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. In addition, two of the Republicans most interested in Medicare reform—the new Senate Majority Leader, Bill Frist (the Senate's only member who is a physician), and the House Ways and Means Committee chair, Bill Thomas—were in a position to give the issue priority and exert considerable control over the legislative process. It became increasingly likely, therefore, that Congress and President Bush would agree to add outpatient prescription drug benefits to Medicare and that Republican leaders would make every effort to link those benefits to broader restructuring of the Medicare program (Lee, Oliver, and Lipton 2003).\nIn February 2003 President Bush made a “major shift in strategy” and decided not to propose detailed legislation but instead to offer only the general structure of a Medicare reform, incorporating prescription drug coverage in an effort to increase Medicare's reliance on private health plans. In doing so, Bush followed the advice of his congressional liaisons and Republican legislators who said they wanted to draft their own reform plan (California Healthline 2003a, b, c; Goldstein 2003d).\nThe following month the president announced his new “Framework to Modernize and Improve Medicare.” Overlooking his previously stated concerns about expanding the federal budget deficit, he offered $400 billion in new spending over ten years, though not all of it devoted to prescription drug assistance. Low-income beneficiaries would be eligible for a $600 credit toward their drug expenses. All beneficiaries would receive a drug discount card, and those enrolled in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program would receive “catastrophic” coverage for annual prescription drug costs above an unspecified amount, most likely between $5,500 and $7,000. The president's proposal openly encouraged Medicare beneficiaries to leave the traditional fee-for-service program, in which 89 percent are currently enrolled, by offering additional prescription drug coverage to those who joined private, Medicare-approved health plans (California Healthline 2003e; White House 2003). Accordingly, beneficiaries’ coverage would vary considerably, and access to the benefits would depend on the availability of a private plan in a beneficiary's locale.\nWith the distraction created by the war against Iraq in the spring of 2003, many observers believed that Medicare reform would once again be caught up in partisan politics and, without a significant investment of political capital by the president, would languish as it had in prior years (Toner 2003a). In June 2003, however, the Senate Finance Committee came forward with a “bipartisan” agreement that helped break the four-year-old deadlock over Medicare prescription drug coverage. The committee chair, Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), and the ranking minority member, Max Baucus (D-Mont.), announced the agreement with great fanfare and hoped to move the legislation to the Senate floor with little delay. With increasing encouragement from outsiders—including the White House and the leading Democratic voice on health issues, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts—it took only seven days to progress from the announcement of a skeleton, two-page agreement to markup and committee approval of the 90-plus pages of S. 1, the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act. The bill passed out of committee on June 13 by a margin of 16 to 5, with substantial support from members of both parties (Pear and Toner 2003a).\nThe finance committee's approach deviated considerably from the Bush administration's proposal and from legislation previously passed in the House. Medicare beneficiaries would be offered two basic options, starting in 2006: They could join new single-state or multistate preferred-provider organizations, which would offer not only enhanced prescription drug benefits but also specialized disease management services for individuals with chronic conditions, or they could remain in the traditional Medicare program and, if they elected, receive comparable prescription drug benefits offered by private plans. Significantly, the Senate provided that if multiple private plans were not available in a geographic region, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services would provide coverage under a “fallback” plan.\nAs in President Bush's proposal, the Senate package would limit the total outlay to $400 billion over ten years, and as a result, there would be similar gaps in coverage. Medicare would authorize the use of privately sponsored drug discount cards for all beneficiaries starting in 2004, two years before the new benefits would be implemented in January 2006. In that interim period, some low-income beneficiaries would be eligible for a $600 credit toward the purchase of prescription drugs (Kaiser Family Foundation 2003a).\nOn June 27, 2003, the full Senate passed S. 1 by a margin of 76 to 21. The final package closely resembled the initial agreement by the finance committee. It required the new preferred-provider organizations to offer both catastrophic coverage and preventive services in addition to standard Medicare benefits and new prescription drug coverage (Kaiser Family Foundation 2003d; Toner and Pear 2003). The bill passed with substantial bipartisan support, as key Democrats such as Kennedy and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) felt it was best to accept the $400 billion commitment as “money in the bank” toward a more comprehensive program (Toner and Pear 2003).\nThe week after senators unveiled their tentative plan, House Republicans in the two committees with jurisdiction over Medicare—the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee—announced an agreement on H.R. 1, their version of a drug benefit and other elements of Medicare “modernization.” They, too, rejected the Bush administration's proposal to provide significant benefits only to beneficiaries who enrolled in private health plans. Billy Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, had earlier observed, “You couldn't move my mother out of [fee-for-service] Medicare with a bulldozer. She trusts in it, believes in it. It's served her well.” He predicted that his colleagues “almost certainly will want a strong and adequate prescription drug benefit within fee-for-service Medicare” (Pear and Toner 2003a).\nLike the Senate bill, the House bill introduced substantial new subsidies for low-income beneficiaries but made them subject to income and asset tests. A crucial difference from the Senate bill was that the “catastrophic” coverage limit—the annual amount of out-of-pocket spending above which the government would cover all remaining costs—would be higher for beneficiaries with incomes above $60,000. These provisions reintroduced the type of income-related financing that proved so controversial in the MCCA (Goldstein and Dewar 2003a; Kaiser Family Foundation 2003d). An even more controversial provision injected a modified form of “premium support” into the overall Medicare program, which linked future increases in beneficiaries’ premiums to cost increases in whichever part of Medicare they were enrolled, thereby forcing private health plans and the traditional fee-for-service program to compete.\nOn June 17 the House Ways and Means Committee approved, by a margin of 25 to 15, its Medicare reform proposal, which prompted “an impassioned partisan debate over the proper roles of government and private industry in delivering health care to the elderly. … [House Republicans] insisted that private insurers and health plans should have a larger role in Medicare, to avoid any possibility that the government might set drug prices” (Pear and Toner 2003f). Despite partisan rancor and strong resistance from Democrats and some Republicans, the full House narrowly passed H.R. 1 by 216 to 215 votes on the same day as the Senate did, June 27, but only after an abnormally long roll-call vote.\nThe “cliff-hanger” vote came despite intense lobbying by the White House in support of the bill and a visit by Vice President Dick Cheney (R) to the House floor (Angle 2003; Goldstein and Dewar 2003b). House leaders had to persuade several GOP representatives to switch their votes at the last moment to save the measure. Many conservatives were reluctant to commit such large sums to a federal entitlement, and they also felt that the bill did not go far enough in creating incentives for beneficiaries to switch from the traditional fee-for-service program to private health plans. To hold on to some conservative votes, House leaders attached a provision to expand the tax-exempt health savings accounts for uninsured or self-insured individuals and families, a move that was projected to add $174 billion more to the federal deficit over ten years (CBO 2003, 5; Toner and Pear 2003).\nRepublicans had a strong motivation to reconcile the differences in the cost-sharing and delivery systems and to pass a bill for President Bush to sign into law in advance of the 2004 election campaign. House and Senate leaders convened a conference committee in August 2003 and initially planned to complete their work by the end of the summer. The conference committee was heavily stacked in favor of Republican priorities. The chair, Thomas, allowed only two Democratic senators to participate in the day-to-day discussions—Baucus, who was working side by side with Finance Committee Chair Grassley, and Breaux, who had long supported market-oriented reforms with Frist and Thomas. Minority Leader Daschle, who had voted for the original Senate bill, was excluded entirely from the discussions. The three Democratic conferees from the House were also excluded, which reduced their participation to signing or not signing the conference committee report (Carey 2003a; Pear and Toner 2003e).\nThis “hardball” approach did not ensure a smooth process, however, and it took four months of negotiations to craft a package that might attract enough votes to get a bill to the president's desk. The chief negotiators, Thomas for the House and Grassley for the Senate, clashed over personalities and substance, not all related to drug coverage. At one point, Grassley's staff boycotted the meetings when he felt that there was insufficient commitment to increasing Medicare payments to hospitals and physicians in rural areas—a side issue but nonetheless one of the Iowa senator's priorities for the overall legislative package (Pear 2003a). As the conference committee was attempting to reach closure on its most difficult issues in late October, Thomas distributed a proposal that was written without outside consultation and disregarded weeks of bargaining among members. By mid-November, Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) interceded and directly negotiated a plan with Frist, believing that Thomas could not produce a bill that enough Democrats would support (Cohen, Victor, and Baumann 2004; Goldstein 2003b).\nThe leaders of the conference committee faced a number of problems: The first was to design a benefit that a majority of members could be persuaded to back. To do that, it had to satisfy members from rural states and districts—particularly those in the Senate (Toner 2003b). It could not rely heavily on managed care, since many rural states currently had no Medicare+Choice options and, furthermore, policymakers and beneficiaries were distrustful of private health plans after many pulled out of the program. Practically speaking, the drug benefit for beneficiaries in traditional Medicare needed to be equal or nearly equal to that given to beneficiaries who enrolled in managed care plans.\nIn addition, both bills depended on the emergence of drug-only insurance plans to serve the vast majority of beneficiaries who were in the traditional fee-for-service program. This was a significant departure from the logic of risk pooling and integrated benefits: From 1965 to 1994, all proposals to add prescription drug benefits contemplated a straightforward expansion of the Medicare Part B program. Since the Clinton administration proposal in 1999, however, a separate drug benefit administered by private organizations had been the dominant approach. Under the Clinton proposal, the federal government would have been the insurer under a new Medicare Part D, whereas under the legislative proposals in 2003 the economic risk fell primarily on private plans.\nIn the past, the insurance industry had opposed this approach. In 2000 Charles Kahn III, then the president of the Health Insurance Association of America, argued that no insurer would provide drug-only coverage because “it would be like providing insurance for haircuts”: only those seniors with high out-of-pocket costs would be motivated to join the new plans. If insurers were not free to set premiums, they could easily lose money on such plans (Morgan 2000; Pear 2000, 2003e). Given the real possibility that private drug plans would not materialize or would prove unsustainable in some areas, policymakers needed a way to ensure universal availability of the drug benefits. Nonetheless, conservatives fiercely resisted the Senate's requirement for the federal government itself to provide “fallback” drug coverage.\nThe second problem was how to meet beneficiaries’ expectations and needs under emerging budgetary constraints. Just as government estimates in 1999 and 2000 of large budget surpluses improved the feasibility of adopting a new benefit, the financial picture in 2003 appeared to diminish the capacity for significant prescription drug subsidies. After his inauguration in January 2001, President Bush gave first priority to a tax cut that, along with the sluggish economy, eliminated the surplus revenues that could have funded new Medicare benefits. The federal government faced record budget deficits of $375 billion for FY2003 and $477 billion for FY2004, exacerbated by the invasion and occupation of Iraq and the hundreds of billions of dollars in additional tax cuts (CBO 2004a, 1, 129; Weisman 2003). Many conservative Republicans were growing anxious about even more commitments for mandatory federal spending (Grier 2003). Before the war and a second round of tax cuts, the congressional budget resolution for FY2004 set aside $400 billion in future spending for augmenting Medicare; so if Congress did not act now, it would become difficult to set aside anything close to that amount in future budgets (Carey 2003b).\nThe $400 billion devoted to prescription drug coverage would cover scarcely one-fifth of the estimated $1.85 trillion that Medicare beneficiaries were expected to spend on drugs over the next decade. According to the Congressional Budget Office, prescription drug spending for the Medicare population would grow from $95 billion in FY2004 to $284 billion in FY2013. The new benefits, therefore, would be costly to the government but only of marginal value to many beneficiaries who did not qualify for additional low-income subsidies. For example, a beneficiary with $1,000 in annual drug costs would pay $826 in premiums, deductible, and coinsurance under the House plan and $1,046 under the Senate plan. A beneficiary who required $5,000 worth of medicine would still have out-of-pocket costs of $3,926 under the House plan and $3,296 under the Senate plan (CBO 2003, 11).\nThis calculation led many experts to predict that seniors would experience “sticker shock” and realize that “after so many promises, the proposed drug benefit will look nothing like what they expected” (Pear and Toner 2003d; Stolberg 2003b). Under these circumstances, many beneficiaries would want to keep their current supplemental insurance coverage. In fact, 56 percent of the seniors polled in August 2003 agreed with the view that “Congress should vote against this bill and work to pass one that provides more help to seniors, even if it might take years to get done and cost the government more.” Only 33 percent of seniors agreed with the argument that “something is better than nothing. Congress should pass this bill now, even though it would leave many seniors paying a substantial share of their drug costs, and work to improve benefits in the future” (Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health 2003, 7).\nThe third problem was how to maneuver this highly visible, and highly controversial, legislation through congressional procedures. If the conference committee reached agreement on a reform package, the capacity of House leaders to push through a bill was already in doubt, given the one-vote margin on H.R. 1 in June. To move closer to the Senate version, which was necessary to maintain critical bipartisan support there, would likely alienate the more conservative House Republicans. Senate approval was likely to be even more difficult, despite the fact that S. 1 passed with a large majority in June. If “sweeteners” were added in the conference committee negotiations to assuage particular constituencies and gain votes, the cost of the overall package might exceed the $400 billion ceiling, and the legislation could be ruled out of order.\nPassage was also more difficult because Republican leaders chose not to pursue an omnibus budget reconciliation bill in 2003. Usually, budget legislation is the preferred vehicle for making changes in Medicare (Oliver and Lee 2000, 49–53). Budget reconciliation has an important advantage in the Senate: It cannot be filibustered and requires only a simple majority to pass. That both houses proceeded with independent legislation suggests that even though Republicans may have had the power to enact Medicare reforms of their choosing, they feared that a near-straight party-line vote would leave them and President Bush vulnerable to a voter backlash in 2004 if beneficiaries were disappointed with the financial value, the workability, or the timing of the new prescription drug benefits, which would not go into effect until 2006.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003\nAt several points, participants close to the conference committee negotiations believed that another opportunity for reform would be missed. On November 15, however, the conferees reached agreement on a new version of H.R. 1, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The 678-page conference report included many of the features that had come to be widely accepted in earlier proposals, such as the discount card, additional assistance for low-income beneficiaries, a substantial gap in benefits for individuals with high drug costs (the “doughnut hole”), and the use of private pharmacy benefit managers in lieu of direct governmental regulation. Yet the bill reflected “concession” more than “compromise,” with the final provisions on some of the most controversial issues watered down so as to become almost meaningless to their proponents. This deepened rather than resolved cleavages that pitted Democrats against Republicans and, at times, Republicans against Republicans (Goldstein 2003c; Rapp 2003).\nThe final product included the following major provisions (CBO 2004a, 12–3; Health Policy Alternatives 2003c; Kaiser Family Foundation 2004):\nIt offered to Medicare beneficiaries relatively immediate, if modest, financial relief in the form of drug discount cards sponsored by private firms with federal approval. The voluntary interim program would begin in mid-2004. Medicare would pay the $30 enrollment fee and provide a $600 credit for those beneficiaries with a household income below 135 percent of poverty (in 2003, $12,123 for an individual and $16,362 for a couple) who do not qualify for Medicaid or have other coverage. Beneficiaries would be allowed to enroll in only one discount program.\nIt required most beneficiaries to choose between maintaining any existing prescription drug coverage or joining a new Medicare Part D program, beginning in January 2006. The Part D drug benefits would be offered through stand-alone drug plans or through comprehensive plans under Part C, renamed the Medicare Advantage program. The standard Part D benefits would have an estimated initial premium of $35 per month and a $250 annual deductible. Medicare would pay 75 percent of annual expenses between $250 and $2,250 for approved prescription drugs, nothing for expenses between $2,250 and $5,100, and 95 percent of expenses above $5,100. Including $420 in premiums, beneficiaries would have to spend $1,590 out of pocket to reach an initial breakeven point, and they would be responsible for $4,020 of the first $5,100 (79 percent) in annual drug expenses. Private plans could adjust their specific benefits as long as they remained actuarially equivalent to the standard benefits.\nIt mandated that all individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid would now be required to receive their drug coverage through Medicare. The government would cover the premiums, deductible, and coinsurance for beneficiaries eligible for Medicaid or who have an income below 135 percent of poverty and meet an asset test of $6,000 per individual or $9,000 per couple. Beneficiaries who have an income under 150 percent of poverty and who meet an asset test of $10,000 per individual or $20,000 per couple would be eligible for sliding-scale premiums, a $50 deductible, and 15 percent coinsurance. All beneficiaries would be required to make small copayments for each prescription. The states would be required to pass back to the federal government $88 billion of the estimated $115 billion they would save on Medicaid drug coverage.\nIt prohibited beneficiaries who enrolled in Part D from buying supplemental benefits to insure against prescription drug expenses not covered by the program. Thus, they would not be able to enroll in Part D and convert existing retiree benefits or Medigap policies into “wraparound” coverage to pay the Part D premiums, deductible, and coinsurance. Also, a late enrollment penalty would raise Part D premiums by at least 1 percent for each month of delayed enrollment (for beneficiaries who switched out of preexisting coverage or failed to enroll in Part D when they first became eligible).\nIt required that at least two options for Part D benefits from different entities be available to beneficiaries. Medicare could assume financial risk and contract with private entities to establish regional “fallback” plans where necessary, but it could not establish a national fallback plan.\nIt provided more than $86 billion in subsidies for employers and unions to encourage them to maintain their prescription drug coverage for retirees. This addressed one of the AARP's principal concerns and earlier estimates (2003) by the Congressional Budget Office that approximately one-quarter of Medicare beneficiaries with current employer-sponsored drug coverage would lose it once the benefit was enacted.\nIt allowed new Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies approved by the government and to negotiate independently with drug manufacturers, but it prohibited the government from negotiating prices directly.\nIt maintained the current ban on reimporting prescription drugs from other countries but authorized the Food and Drug Administration to study the potential effects of reimportation from Canada.\nIt abandoned the House plan to allow price competition between the traditional fee-for-service program and the managed care program and replaced it with a demonstration project in up to six metropolitan areas, not to begin until 2010.\nIt significantly scaled back the scope and expected use of health savings accounts, reducing the estimated cost from $174 billion to $6 billion in lost tax revenue.\nIt committed $14 billion to boost payments to managed care plans in the Medicare Advantage program. At least temporarily, managed care plans would, for the first time, be paid more per enrollee than the average cost in the traditional fee-for-service program.\nIt provided $21 billion to increase Medicare fee-for-service payments to health care providers in rural areas.\nThe most direct benefits of the legislation would go to low-income Medicare beneficiaries who have no supplemental source of insurance coverage through retiree benefits, Medigap plans, or Medicaid. But there were other clear winners as well: Pharmaceutical manufacturers could now expect a higher demand from their best customers, and they prevailed on all three of their priority issues: no direct administration of benefits by the federal government, no explicit cost control measures, and no legalization of drug reimportation (Connolly 2003; Harris 2003). Employers, managed care plans, rural health care providers, and teaching hospitals would receive more than $125 billion in short-term subsidies (Goldstein 2003c). In the eyes of one analyst, it was “a classic election-year giveaway, a year early” (Abelson and Freudenheim 2003). Another was even more critical:\nHere's another bit of insanity: The bill pays private insurance companies to take elderly patients. You know how one of the tenets of conservative philosophy is that private companies can always deliver a product better and cheaper? So why does the Medicare bill offer billions in subsidies to private insurers to induce them into the market? That's not competition; that's corporate welfare.\nBruce Vladeck, a former administrator of the Medicare program, observed that “distributive politics”—providing favors for important industries and geographic constituencies—is an integral feature of Medicare policymaking, along with regulation and economic redistribution across age and income groups (Vladeck 1999b). Each of the major and minor subsidies inserted into the final version of H.R. 1 might well help achieve a given policy objective, but they could also help attract the votes of legislators who would otherwise oppose the bill for partisan or ideological reasons (Abelson 2003; Lee 2003; Samuelson 2003). These subsidies also helped gain support from a number of major interest groups, including the American Association of Health Plans, American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, General Motors, and, of course, PhRMA (Goldstein 2003c; Pear and Toner 2003e).\nThe prospects for reform increased dramatically when, on November 17, 2003, the AARP appeared to go against the tide of public opinion and announced its support: “The endorsement provides a seal of approval from an organization with 35 million members. Republicans also hope it provides political cover against charges by some Democrats that the bill would undermine the federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled” (Pear and Toner 2003g). The AARP committed $7 million to a weeklong newspaper and television advertising campaign aimed at Medicare beneficiaries and wavering members of Congress who were about to vote on the bill. It was a coup for Republicans, some of whom had previously referred to the AARP as a “wholly owned subsidiary” of the Democratic Party. In turn, the AARP's endorsement infuriated its usual allies in the Democratic leadership and labor and consumer groups, and in protest, 60,000 members either resigned or chose not to re their membership (Broder 2004; Broder and Goldstein 2003; Carey 2003b; Pear and Toner 2003g; Stolberg 2003a; Vaida 2004).\nDespite the AARP's “defection,” the outcome was still very much in doubt as congressional leaders planned for the final debate and votes on the reform package. Liberal opponents such as the AFL-CIO; Association of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees; Consumers Union; Families USA; and American Nurses’ Association criticized the inadequacy of the drug benefits, the threat to retiree benefit programs, its boost to private health plans, and the lack of any meaningful price controls. Key Democrats who had supported the original Senate bill, particularly Daschle and Kennedy, came out strongly against H.R. 1 when it increased Part B's premiums for high-income beneficiaries and did not allow the government itself to offer drug benefits directly when private options were unavailable (Dionne 2003; Pear and Toner 2003c, e). A few Republicans planned to vote against the bill because it failed to include provisions allowing seniors and other Americans to buy lower-priced drugs from other countries, a proposal that the general public supported by a margin of three to one (Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health 2003). At least one Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, found it “outrageous” that H.R. 1 prohibited the federal government from using its purchasing power to negotiate better prices for Medicare beneficiaries (Pear and Hulse 2003).\nConservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation and the National Taxpayers Union attacked the new benefits as a burden to taxpayers and the economy. They criticized what they regarded as an inevitable replacement of employer-sponsored retiree coverage with a massive new public prescription drug program (notwithstanding its administration by private contractors). They also opposed any Medicare legislation that did not establish direct price competition between the managed care and fee-for-service programs (Agan 2003; Butler, Moffit, and Riedl 2003; Chen 2003). Conservative Republicans in the House had earlier warned the leadership that they would vote against the final bill if it eliminated or scaled back the main market-oriented reforms, premium support, and health savings accounts (Goldstein 2003b).\nTrying to quell a rebellion in his own party, House Speaker Hastert recognized that the upcoming vote was uncertain. But he went ahead because the members were anxious to break for the Thanksgiving holiday and the bill could not realistically be revived during the upcoming presidential election campaign (Koszczuk and Allen 2003). The House vote on the conference report came at 3:00 a.m. on Saturday, November 22. The reforms appeared to be dead when, at the end of the normal 15 minutes allowed for voting, the bill was losing by 15 votes. At that point, Hastert and the rest of the Republican leadership went into action and eventually faced a razor-edge margin of 216 to 218. It stuck there while HHS secretary Tommy Thompson, defying House custom, moved onto the floor and the leaders roused President Bush to make another half-dozen calls to convince a handful of their colleagues to change their votes. A Republican who is retiring in 2004 claimed he was offered $100,000 to help his son run for his seat on the condition that he switch his vote (Schuler and Carey 2004). After holding open the vote for nearly three hours—by far the longest known roll-call vote in the history of the House—H.R. 1 passed by a margin of 220 to 215. The vote closely followed party lines: only 16 Democrats supported the final package, while 25 Republicans opposed it (Broder 2003; Carey 2003b; Koszczuk and Allen 2003).\nOn November 25 the Senate leadership brought up H.R. 1 for final action, and again for many hours the outcome was far from certain. A vote to close off debate prevailed by a wide margin, but it appeared that opponents would succeed in blocking the legislation on a budgetary point of order. The Congressional Budget Office officially projected a net cost of $395 billion for the reform package. Democrats, however, contended that the budgetary impact of the tax-free health savings accounts had not been fully accounted for and that if it were, the cost of the full package would exceed the $400 billion limit allowed by the Senate budget resolution several months earlier. After colleagues beseeched him to support the president and his party, former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) gave in and cast the deciding vote to waive the budget rules and proceed to an up-or-down vote on the Medicare bill itself. He then voted against the bill along with eight other Republican senators, but 11 Democrats and one independent (Jeffords) voted in favor of the reforms, and the final version of H.R. 1 was approved by a margin of 54 to 44 (Carey 2003a; Koszczuk and Allen 2003).\nAn editorial in the Washington Post summarized this chaotic conclusion to the debate on H.R. 1:\nFor sheer political drama, it would be hard to beat the past few days on Capitol Hill. Between the normally apolitical hours of 3 and 6 on Saturday morning, the House voted, by the tiniest of margins, to pass a hugely controversial Medicare bill. During the vote, which was of unprecedented length, the House Republican leadership cajoled, berated and twisted arms, barely controlling a conservative revolt, while President Bush, jet-lagged from his trip to Europe, called up recalcitrant members one by one. On Monday it was the Senate's turn. Opponents of the bill used a bag of parliamentary tricks in an attempt to defeat what Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has called an “attack on Medicare as we know it.” Nevertheless, two attempts to waylay the bill were defeated by some of the bribes and threats that won the day in the House, along with the fears of some Democratic senators of blocking a big new entitlement bill so soon before an election.\nSenator Daschle and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Cal.) protested the Republican majority's extraordinary moves to pass the new law. They predicted that this was not the end of the process and promised to introduce legislation to repeal parts of it (Bettelheim 2003; Carey 2003a; Pear 2004a). Several controversies over Medicare and prescription drug coverage continued as the policy process moved from enactment to implementation in 2004.\nOne issue was the affordability of drugs: “Critics argue that the Republicans were so sensitive to the drug industry's fear of price controls that they left the elderly exposed to a future of soaring drug costs” (Toner 2004). The head of a prominent consumer group, Families USA, argued that the price of drugs was the “No. 1, 2, and 3 concern” of beneficiaries and warned that the provision barring the federal government from directly negotiating prices for Medicare was a “lightning rod” in the law (Toner 2004). Another was the failure to legalize the reimportation of drugs. Many states and local governments already have drawn up plans to buy directly or enable their residents to buy prescription drugs from Canadian companies, directly challenging the federal ban on such practices (Belluck 2003; Dealing Drugs 2004).\nCongress revived the issue of drug reimportation when President Bush nominated Mark McClellan, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a former White House health adviser, to become the new administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. During the debate over Medicare reform in 2003, McClellan argued that the government was incapable of ensuring the safety of drugs from other countries and that therefore the existing ban should be kept in place. In his confirmation hearings in March 2004, however, McClellan stated that he was “absolutely committed” to helping Americans safely import lower-cost medicines and that he would work with Congress on legislation to allow drugs to be imported from Canada (Pear 2004b).\nAnother controversy arose when the president's Office of Management and Budget announced in January 2004 that it projected the new law would cost the federal government $534 billion over ten years—35 percent higher than the estimate of $395 billion that lawmakers had relied on when they voted on the final package just a few weeks earlier (CBO 2004b; Pear 2004a). The discrepancy stemmed from different assumptions about how many Medicare beneficiaries would join private health plans, how many would sign up for the Medicare Part D drug coverage, how rapidly Medicaid drug spending would rise, and many other “moving parts” in the legislation (Antos 2004; CBO 2004b). But the issue of technical assumptions was soon overwhelmed by the issue of political accountability. In March 2004 the chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services revealed that as early as the previous summer, his office had estimated much higher costs for the proposed reforms than congressional budget analysts had. His superiors in the Bush administration, however, ordered him to withhold the estimates from members of Congress and warned him that “the consequences for insubordination [would be] extremely severe” (Goldstein 2004; Stolberg 2004). The revelation forced Secretary Thompson to ask HHS's inspector general to launch an investigation into whether the administration improperly withheld information from legislators.\nThe concealment of budget estimates reflects the usual tug-of-war between the executive and legislative branches of government, yet it has had very real consequences. Members of both parties have acknowledged that if the administration's estimates had been known to legislators and the public, significant changes would likely have been required in the final provisions of H.R. 1. Otherwise, it would have faced even stronger opposition from conservatives in the House, and opponents in the Senate may well have succeeded in blocking the bill on a budgetary point of order (Contempt for Congress 2004; Schuler and Carey 2004; Stolberg and Pear 2004). In that event, policymakers would have missed yet another major opportunity to establish Medicare drug benefits, and initiatives would not come until 2005 at the earliest. As things stand now, observers see the Medicare law “devolving from a signature policy achievement into a growing political liability” for Republicans in the middle of an election year (Schuler and Carey 2004).\nPatterns in Policymaking and Their Consequences for Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage\nNext we look at how, over time, policymakers have handled the issue of improving prescription drug coverage in Medicare. We draw on theories of the policy process to analyze when and how opportunities for policy change arise, what options for drug benefits are favored, and what factors lead to the success or failure of initiatives. We also examine how the current handling of this issue is influenced by many “legacies” of earlier decisions. These patterns, we argue, are critical to understanding the conditions that finally allowed the establishment of a Medicare drug benefit in 2003.\nMajor Policy Change Requires Political Opportunities and Leadership\nThe need to cover outpatient prescription drugs was evident soon after Medicare was implemented. It was not inevitable that nearly four decades later, beneficiaries would still lack adequate coverage for this crucial component of modern medical care. Rather, the history we outlined earlier includes a number of missed opportunities for creating a Medicare drug benefit. That history illustrates how policy changes depend on shifts in political priorities, leadership, fiscal conditions, and the element of chance. It also demonstrates that Medicare prescription drug coverage has seldom been debated as an independent issue; rather, in nearly every debate, its fate has rested on the success or failure of other proposed changes to Medicare or the broader health insurance system.\nJohn Kingdon (1995) argued that issues rise to the top of the policy agenda when two conditions are met. First, an abrupt shift in how a problem is perceived or in who controls the levers of governmental power opens a “window of opportunity” for policy innovation. Second, three relatively independent “streams” in the policy process—problems, policies, and politics—must converge. If advocates are able to couple their preferred policy alternative with the prevailing definition of the problem and the priorities of political leaders, organized interests, and public opinion, then the resulting alternative is likely to rise on the policy agenda and may lead to significant action within a short period of time.\nThe first major opportunity for improving Medicare coverage came in 1967 when President Johnson appointed HEW's Task Force on Prescription Drugs. In its final report in 1969, the task force recommended adding such coverage to Medicare. The timing of the report could not have been worse, however. Amid social unrest and political battering over the Vietnam War and his Great Society programs, President Johnson unexpectedly chose not to run for reelection in 1968.\nWhen Vice President Hubert Humphrey (D) narrowly lost the presidential election to Richard Nixon, it became much more difficult to sustain the Johnson administration's initiatives. A review of the task force's recommendations for the incoming Nixon administration endorsed prescription drug coverage for Medicare, but neither HEW secretary Finch nor any of his successors drew up a formal proposal. A major window of opportunity thus closed with the change of administration. Over the next few years, rising costs in Medicare and Medicaid diverted what might have been the natural course of action, to expand eligibility and benefits, and cost containment became the chief priority for President Nixon and every succeeding president.\nA combination of circumstances—the Reagan administration's desire to turn attention away from the Iran/contra scandal, the Democrats’ desire for action on domestic issues after recapturing control of the Senate in 1986, and the unusual personal interest of HHS secretary Bowen in strengthening financial protection of Medicare beneficiaries—enabled the development of the MCCA and its universal but limited prescription drug benefit. Like many innovations in public policy, the MCCA required an extended period of what Kingdon calls “softening up,” during which policy entrepreneurs develop the basic idea for reform and test the feasibility of different approaches (Kingdon 1995, 127–31). For the MCCA, this began with the 1984 report of the Social Security Advisory Council. President Reagan solicited action on catastrophic coverage for Medicare in his 1986 State of the Union address, which opened a political window of opportunity for legislative initiatives.\nFrom 1986 to mid-1988, congressional committees wrestled with different versions of the catastrophic coverage bill, driven by the first opportunity in a generation to “improve” Medicare by adding a variety of new benefits but constrained by Reagan's insistence that the bill not add to the federal budget deficit. Budget neutrality was the key factor in undermining the MCCA, since it forced seniors to shoulder the entire cost of the new coverage and effectively required well-off Medicare beneficiaries to subsidize lower-income beneficiaries.\nAnother window of opportunity opened in 1993 when the Clinton administration presented its plan for comprehensive health care reform. Given the guarantee of comprehensive benefits for the population under age 65, it was appropriate and politically necessary to add prescription drugs and other benefits to make the scope of Medicare benefits comparable. When the Clinton plan failed, enrollment in managed care rose rapidly throughout the U.S. health care system, including Medicare. Many plans offered additional benefits such as prescription drugs and also significantly reduced or eliminated most out-of-pocket costs. This may have helped convince many policymakers that moving most or all beneficiaries into managed care plans would be politically feasible and that universal prescription drug coverage would emerge automatically as a result of the private sector's practices, thereby eliminating the need for governmental mandates and explicit sources of financing. As the first step in that direction, Congress created the Medicare+Choice program in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\nNot surprisingly, then, when Congress created the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, there was no mention of prescription drug coverage in its charge. The main proposals in 1999 called for the broad restructuring and privatization of the program, thus building on the Medicare+Choice approach. Only when several members expressed serious reservations about the commission's final proposals did the idea of adding drug benefits surface as a “sweetener” to win the number of votes needed to recommend a reform package to Congress.\nThe other significant development was the unexpected emergence of federal budget surpluses beginning in 1998, which enabled policymakers to come forward with proposals to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare independent of the program's broad restructuring. As Kingdon explained, “A proposal must be shown to have a tolerable cost, at least a tolerable cost to the federal budget” (Kingdon 1995, 138). The combination of sizable budget surpluses along with unexpectedly low growth in spending for the rest of the Medicare program made it much easier to advocate an expensive new prescription drug program.\nAfter 1999, the combination of rising costs, unequal access to coverage, a sharp decline in the stock market and retirement funds, and partisan politics forced policymakers to reexamine the options for a Medicare drug benefit. When the Balanced Budget Act trimmed capitation payments to Medicare HMOs, many responded by reducing or eliminating coverage for prescription drugs and other supplemental benefits. Employer-sponsored coverage for retirees also was eroding. Nearly a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries had no prescription drug assistance, and existing sources of assistance were becoming less and less adequate with each passing year. In addition, the rising cost of prescription drugs had become an issue for all Americans (Freudenheim 2003b). Per capita spending on prescription drugs rose at an annual rate of 13 percent or more each year from 1998 to 2002, several times the general inflation rate or rate of growth in the nation's gross domestic product (Strunk and Ginsburg 2003). Both Kingdon (1995, 95–9) and Jack Walker (1981, 88) observed that indicators like these help define problems or “performance gaps” that create the demand for governmental action.\nBy 2002–03, the inadequacy of coverage for Medicare beneficiaries joined other issues such as automatic patent extensions and the reimportation of drugs from other countries. In clear violation of existing law, states and communities created programs to buy prescription drugs from Canada (Belluck 2003) and senior citizens were crossing the borders with Canada and Mexico to buy lower-cost medicine (Flaherty and Paul 2003). These controversies were mutually reinforcing and put the pharmaceutical industry on the defensive. The pressure for reform was now probably higher than ever before.\nFor several reasons, the time for a Medicare prescription drug program finally arrived in 2003. What favored governmental action was that as in Kingdon's conceptual model, the three “streams” in the agenda-setting process—problems, policies, and politics—converged at a moment when a “window of opportunity” for reform was open. As noted earlier, the problem of rising drug costs and the resulting decline in the ability of Medicare beneficiaries to secure and maintain supplemental coverage was serious and growing worse. In fact, this was the first time since 1969 that prescription drug coverage was the primary issue on the policy agenda and that its fate was not strongly bound to broader proposals for health care reform.\nEven though the Bush administration and Republican congressional leaders tried to use the enhanced drug benefits as a way to induce beneficiaries to join private managed care plans, members of both parties in Congress bowed to political realities and public dissatisfaction with managed care and developed what is primarily a package of new subsidies for prescription drug assistance. Kingdon contended that in the “primeval soup” of the policy stream, “creative activity usually involves recombination of old elements more than fresh invention of new ones” (Kingdon 1995, 124). From 1999 onward, all the major issues in designing a Medicare prescription drug benefit had been identified, and all the major components had been examined by officials and experts alike (e.g., CBO 2002). Thus the task for House and Senate leaders was to fit a variety of components into a $400 billion package that would pass muster with their colleagues and key constituencies. The income-related financing, the “doughnut hole” in coverage, the discount cards, and the reliance on pharmacy benefit managers were all adapted from recent proposals. The option of having the private sector manage the pharmacy benefits was especially important, as it allowed Republicans and their allies in the drug industry to support new benefits without appearing to support an expansion of governmental authority and bureaucracy.\nFinally, there was sufficient political capacity and will to address this problem. A new, extraordinary window of opportunity opened when Republicans regained majority control of the Senate and maintained control of the House after the 2002 elections. At that point, President Bush made Medicare reform one of his administration's highest domestic priorities. Two of his party's most powerful legislators, Senate Majority Leader Frist and House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas, considered Medicare reform to be a high priority and were in a position to shepherd it through the Congress. Republican leaders concluded that they could claim credit for a prescription drug benefit but also that since they controlled both the legislative and executive branches of government, they could face negative consequences at the polls in 2004 if they failed to deliver on President Bush's pledge in the 2000 campaign. In their view, Medicare reform could take a major issue away from the Democrats and help ensure President Bush's reelection and the Republicans’ domination of national politics. The chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), pointed out that “if we can't pass it, that is a big problem for us. There's no question the responsibility falls on a Republican president and Senate and House Republicans, and that's why it won't fail” (Dewar 2003).\nThe president and other Republican leaders made numerous concessions by greatly increasing the amount of subsidies over those of previous proposals and by agreeing that beneficiaries could get generally equivalent benefits even if they remained in the fee-for-service program. The fact that President Bush and many conservatives in Congress were still willing to commit $400 billion to get legislation enacted in 2003, despite the mounting costs of the war in Iraq and an unprecedented budget deficit, testifies to the eagerness of Republicans to co-opt an issue that has traditionally favored Democrats. Sensing that the limited bipartisan cooperation in the Senate prevented a filibuster, President Bush invested his political capital to win over skeptical allies and enact legislation as soon as possible (California Healthline 2003d; Goldstein 2003a).\nPolitical support was also easier to obtain now than in the past because the “pay-as-you-go” requirements of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 expired in 2002. As a result, policymakers were not forced to create a costly prescription drug benefit within a zero-sum financial game, which would force them to pay for the new coverage by imposing the higher costs on seniors themselves, increasing taxes, or making cuts in other parts of Medicare or other domestic programs. The willingness to spend new federal revenues made it far less likely that policymakers would see a repeat of the revolt that led to repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act and its drug benefit in 1989. Nonetheless, the concerns held by both liberals and conservatives about specific provisions in the final conference report kept its fate uncertain until the very end.\nUltimately, it was the “sheer force” of the Republican leadership—House Speaker Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Frist, in concert with President Bush and HHS secretary Thompson—and perhaps the suppression of the administration's cost estimates, that maintained sufficient party discipline to nudge the reform package over the finish line in 2003 (Goldstein 2003b; Koszczuk and Allen 2003; Schuler and Carey 2004). This particular episode, as well as those that preceded it, illustrate what political scholars regard as an inherent unpredictability in the policy process, in which ideas, individual leaders, and the context for debate are often as influential as conventional political interests in determining the scope and substance of the agenda and the translation of proposals into policy (Baumgartner and Jones 1993; Jones 1989; Kingdon 1995; Oliver 1996; Polsby 1984; Walker 1981).\nThe Core Values of Competing Advocacy Coalitions Can Produce Policy Deadlock\nWhereas Kingdon highlights the potential instability of politics and policymaking, other analysts focus on the reasons why certain policies are so resistant to change. We explain next how the ideological conflict between those seeking to expand the traditional Medicare program and those preferring a greater role for private health care companies prevented political agreement on adding prescription drug coverage over the last decade and what forces narrowly broke the deadlock in 2003.\nAccording to Paul Sabatier and Hank Jenkins-Smith (1993), long-term policy change depends on the competition among two or more “advocacy coalitions” whose members monitor and actively try to influence specific policy issues. Like Kingdon, Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith do acknowledge some degree of punctuated equilibrium in policy development. In their view, most policy changes are the product of shifts in large-scale social, economic, or political conditions. These shifts roughly correspond to what Kingdon calls “windows of opportunity” in the policy process. As the history of Medicare and prescription drug coverage demonstrates, however, even with a major shift in political power or other external circumstances, it is often difficult for government to respond to even serious problems because an effective response would violate the core values of an advocacy coalition.\nSabatier and Jenkins-Smith argue that on many, if not most, policy issues, the competing coalitions are not temporary alliances—“strange bedfellows”—but, rather, individuals and organizations with the same values and beliefs concerning what constitutes appropriate and effective public policy. They hold “deep-core” normative beliefs and “near-core” policy beliefs that are highly resistant to change. In addition, they hold a variety of “secondary” beliefs that are more tactical than strategic and are more subject to change over time. Building on these beliefs, they develop long-standing relationships with other members of the advocacy coalition and exhibit a high degree of coordination on political strategy.\nIn the absence of changes in broader, contextual conditions, Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith believe that policy still can change if partisan positions are modified through a process of “policy learning.” Policy learning is a fairly subtle and gradual process. The members of an advocacy coalition almost never change their deep-core values and beliefs, which dictate their basic orientation to an issue and the role of government. But they may change their “near-core” policy-oriented beliefs and a variety of “secondary” beliefs when new information overcomes their claims about the nature of a problem or the effectiveness of a solution. Given a new understanding of the problem and potential remedies, current policies may become indefensible, and a coalition may accept new methods of government intervention.\nFor most of Medicare's history, the principal advocacy coalitions were organized around the interests of providers, beneficiaries, and government officials (Oliver 1993, 128–30). The core values centered on professional autonomy (and economic interest) for providers, the preservation of meaningful entitlements for beneficiaries, and the protection of the public purse for government officials. Within the government coalition there was considerable bipartisanship, which was useful when countering beneficiaries’ and providers’ shared interests in expanding services and when instituting regulatory regimes for cost containment (Oberlander 2003, 106, 133; Oliver 1993, 132–41).\nThe politics of the Clinton health plan drastically changed the politics of Medicare in the mid-1990s. Although President Clinton had seized on “managed competition” as a synthesis of liberal goals and conservative methods (Hacker 1997; Starr 1992), the health insurance industry, small business groups, pharmaceutical companies, and other opponents successfully attacked the reforms on the grounds that they represented heavy-handed intrusion into individual choice and created sizable bureaucracies to manage the system and constrain costs if competition failed to do so (Johnson and Broder 1996; Skocpol 1996).\nRepublicans helped kill the “big government” Clinton plan and then moved to dismantle many existing government programs once they captured control of Congress in 1995. As Haynes Johnson and David Broder pointed out, “It was not consensus politics being practiced in Washington or even conservative politics as previously defined. This was ideological warfare, a battle to destroy the remnants of the liberal, progressive brand of politics that had governed America through most of the twentieth century” (Johnson and Broder 1996, 569). Since the mid-1990s, the advocacy coalitions regarding Medicare policy have fractured, dividing providers and government officials in particular. The new coalitions are much more aligned with the Democratic and Republican parties, and as a result, the debates over adding prescription drugs and other strategies to “modernize” Medicare are highly polarized.\nIn contemporary politics, conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats often hold fundamentally different deep-core beliefs about individual responsibility, the role of government, and the capacity of the private sector to meet social needs. They also have very different near-core beliefs that shape their policy preferences. Democrats tend to favor a government-financed system of national health insurance. They consider Medicare, along with Social Security, as the central components of a social insurance system that provides universal protection to all of the nation's senior citizens. Where health care is purchased privately, Democrats still favor a strong hand for federal and state regulation of providers, health plans, and the rest of the health care industry.\nIn contrast, Republicans advocate individual, not collective, responsibility for securing most goods and services. They accept a minimal role for the government in Medicaid, welfare, and other safety net programs for the poor and oppose the expansion of universal entitlements. Republicans stress the superiority of markets over government in the allocation of resources and thus want to preserve a major role for private business and health systems in the provision of health care services. Jacob Hacker and Theda Skocpol (1997) described what they perceived to be the threefold strategy adopted by the Republicans: (1) Reduce spending on existing programs and cut taxes to prevent future spending; (2) transfer authority for federal-state programs to the states (e.g., welfare, Medicaid); and (3) replace public services with the public purchase of privately delivered services.\nThese distinct approaches are deeply entrenched, and the series of proposals that have emerged over the past decade indicate that they are unlikely to be modified by more research and analysis. Robin Toner noted how closely intertwined politics has become with policy prescriptions:\nIn fact, the divisions over health care—specifically, how much to trust private markets, how much to rely on government—are among the most profound in politics today. Republicans and their allies say turning Medicare into more of a private health care market place, in which numerous health plans compete for the elderly's business, will give the program's beneficiaries more choices and modernize its bureaucratic structure before the baby boom generation hits.…Democrats and their allies say Medicare was created because the private health insurance market failed to meet the needs of the elderly. They charge that what some Republicans are ultimately aiming for is replacing the guaranteed benefits of Medicare with a voucher. (2003a)\nUltimately, the different approaches of Republicans and Democrats depend on whether one views medical care as a market good or as a medically determined need. According to Sherry Glied, there are sharp contrasts between “marketist” and “medicalist” advocates of health care reform. “Marketists” see health care as just another good or service (Glied 1997, 26). They object to the government's financing of health care because it distorts the market (despite abundant evidence that the market does not function properly in health care). For “medicalists,” allocation should depend on a person's needs as determined by expert providers, whose diagnosis and treatment should be guided entirely by medical science and not cost (despite abundant evidence that practice patterns of health care providers often are unscientific and excessively expensive). Glied argued that ideological differences contribute to political deadlock and undermine even incremental reform, since “every such change increases the likelihood that either the marketist or medicalist view of health care will ultimately prevail” (Glied 1997, 34–5).\nBetween 1999 and 2003, initiatives to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare reached an impasse—even when it appeared that the coverage could easily be funded by federal budget surpluses—because of divided government and ideological conflict between the dominant advocacy coalitions in Medicare policy. More than anything else, the impasse was due to the seemingly irreconcilable core beliefs guiding public policy in general and Medicare in particular. Even when Republican leaders accepted the need for government subsidies of prescription drug costs, they almost exclusively favored the marketist approach to policy design, rejecting standard benefits and central administration. This was especially true for Representative Thomas and his colleagues in the House of Representatives. Most Democratic leaders strongly favored the medicalist approach (albeit with a heavy dose of government oversight). Similarly, the AARP focused on adequate benefits for all beneficiaries—ruling out a strictly marketist approach—and PhRMA vetoed any steps that could easily lead to price controls in what was by far its most lucrative market.\nWhat happened to break the ideological and political impasse in 2003? The policies hammered out in the conference report did little to resolve the most controversial issues:\nNegotiators were never able to bridge the gap between free-market Republicans, on one side, who are hellbent on bringing the private market into the senior health care business; and New Deal Democrats on the other, who hold dearly to the belief that Medicare is a cornerstone of the federal government's social contract with senior citizens. How do you reach a compromise between those two intractable positions? In fact, there is more concession than compromise in this conference report. What it provides is a way to let each side think it has gotten a “foot in the door,” and thus an inroad to its larger objectives.\nThe critical changes were external to the ongoing legislative battles. First, the contextual conditions shifted when the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress and the White House and when President Bush decided to invest heavily in reaching a prescription drug program in order to take that issue away from Democrats in his 2004 reelection campaign. The president and the Republican leadership in Congress intensely lobbied legislators and the pharmaceutical industry to concede some of their market-oriented agenda on Medicare in order to strengthen their broader political agenda.\nSecond, a broadly constructed set of evidence and arguments emerged to challenge the practices of the pharmaceutical industry. Drug manufacturers were accused of charging Medicare beneficiaries prices that were many times higher than the prices for the identical drug in other countries, obtaining unwarranted extensions of patents to pad profits and delay the introduction of generic competitors, and investing millions of dollars in me-too drugs and direct-to-consumer advertising. Criticism of those practices, combined with the spectacular rise in drug spending per beneficiary and the consequent erosion of supplemental coverage through employers and Medicare+Choice, led Republicans to take responsibility for moving legislation that previously would never have been a high priority for them.\nThird, the decision by the AARP to endorse H.R. 1 broke up the long-standing alignment of the competing coalitions and gave lawmakers political cover to vote for the reform package and, if necessary, disregard their ideological convictions. The unprecedented momentum for action forced members of both advocacy coalitions into concessions in policy design that challenged their core values. Conservatives won a heavy role for the private sector in providing drug coverage. But they were unable to dramatically strengthen the overall role of private health plans in Medicare and agreed to give those beneficiaries who choose to remain in the fee-for-service program benefits comparable to those for people enrolled in managed care. Many liberals supported the Senate bill, and a critical few ended up voting for the final version of H.R. 1, even though it introduced means testing of benefits and income-related premiums for the first time in Medicare's history. They may believe that helping the neediest beneficiaries—those with low incomes and those with extraordinary drug expenses—is their core priority. If so, it is preferable to waiting for a more favorable political climate in which to adopt a more universal and generous program. They may also believe that once the government is providing some prescription drug assistance, if that assistance proves inadequate for large numbers of beneficiaries, then policymakers will be forced to improve the program rather than neglect it.\nPolicy Legacies and Learning Heavily Influence the Evolution of Medicare\nAs the advocacy coalition model suggests, many shifts in Medicare policy are based on longitudinal analysis and action, what Richard Rose (1993) called “learning across time.” Simply put, there are several significant ways in which today's problems and possibilities are affected by actions in the past. Similarly, policy changes today will quite possibly have a significant impact on conditions, perceptions, and policy alternatives in the future. Mark Peterson warned of analysis that assumes that\nspecific policy-making events could be well understood without reference to anything beyond the immediate political, institutional, and interpersonal contexts in which they transpired. Identify the players in the game, their vantage points and institutional resources, as well as the vectors of interest-group influence and general electoral incentives, and one had a sufficient explanation of the process of policy deliberation and choice. (1997, 1079–80)\nPeterson's model of social learning builds on the work of Paul Pierson (1993), who found that a change in public policy creates “feedbacks” or “legacies” in two ways. First, by altering existing institutions or creating new ones, it can have “structural effects” on the resources and incentives of participants in the policy process: social groups, governmental elites, or the mass public. Second, policy change can produce “learning effects” that alter the distribution of information and interpretation of social conditions and government actions.\nThe evolution of Medicare has produced a number of structural effects that influence the contemporary debate over prescription drug coverage. Perhaps the most powerful one is the incentive of Medicare beneficiaries to mobilize politically to defend their existing benefits in a program that, despite its defects, gives them greater access to care and greater overall satisfaction than nonelderly adults have with private insurance (Kaiser Family Foundation and Commonwealth Fund 1997). The skepticism of senior citizens about recent proposals to add prescription drug benefits, which were generally linked to proposals for restructuring other program benefits, proved to be a brake on reform efforts until the AARP made its dramatic endorsement of H.R. 1 as it came to a final vote in November 2003.\nThis policy legacy is tied closely to another one, namely, the problem of making a transition from separate Part A and Part B benefits to a more integrated set of benefits and program administration. The limited enrollment in Part C, the Medicare+Choice program (now Medicare Advantage), meant that policymakers were essentially forced to incorporate prescription drug benefits into Part B or create yet another administrative structure, an independent Part D.\nFinally, Medicare's limited benefits—restrictions on institutional stays, no catastrophic coverage, no outpatient prescription drugs—created their own legacy. Part of the reason for creating Medicare was the lack of interest by private insurance companies in offering coverage to retirees. Not only was the coverage expensive, but it also was not regarded as classic insurance, since many seniors had chronic health conditions and a need for services. Yet Medicare beneficiaries demonstrated early on that they wanted comprehensive coverage and protection against catastrophic expenses, and when Medicare did not provide them, they found other sources of supplemental coverage. Today, 87 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental coverage beyond Parts A and B, and 78 percent have some form of prescription drug coverage, whether bought by former employers or Medicaid or paid for out of their own pockets (Kaiser Family Foundation 2003b). It can be argued that over time, the expansion of supplemental coverage has stalled the development of broader benefits within the Medicare program proper (Oberlander 2003, 48–50). In particular, the repeal of the MCCA was in part a legacy of the incomplete benefits accepted by the architects of Medicare in 1965. Beneficiaries who found affordable drug coverage elsewhere were not inclined to support mandatory conversion to a new program (and perhaps pay more for the privilege), and private insurers who sold Medigap or employee retirement benefits were not inclined to give up those customers.\nThe history of Medicare also illustrates a number of learning effects on the current handling of the issue of prescription drug coverage. Peterson makes the important distinction between “substantive learning” about the need for new policies and the relative effectiveness of policy options, and “situational learning” about the political and social consequences of policies (Peterson 1997, 1085–95). Substantive learning tends to be dominated by experts, whereas situational learning tends to be dominated by politicians and organized interests. Substantive learning tends to promote reform, as evidence and arguments mount to support new policies. Conversely, situational learning can either promote or inhibit reform, depending on the lessons that participants learn from past policy initiatives. The evolution of Medicare has numerous examples of each form of policy learning.\nThe most obvious examples of substantive learning in Medicare are the development in the 1980s and 1990s of prospective payment systems for hospitals, physician services, home health, and other services. Each change in policy followed a prolonged period of what policymakers regarded as unacceptable growth in that area of Medicare spending, as well as research on and analysis of methods to control costs without jeopardizing access to services for beneficiaries (e.g., Oliver 1993; Smith 1992). The rapid increase in prescription drug costs relative to those for other health services over the past decade has led both public and private health plans to negotiate lower prices, restrict utilization, and promote generic substitution. Such regulation will almost inevitably become part of any prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries—if not immediately, then soon after its implementation (Oberlander and Jaffe 2003).\nThe repeal of the MCCA in 1989 is an enduring event in the minds of almost all experts in Medicare policy and a prominent source of situational learning. As Peter Hall (1993, 278, 293) and Peterson (1997, 1090) stated, nothing about either substantive or situational learning requires that the lessons learned by policymakers, interest groups, or the public be accurate; rather, it is the political effect on future policy choices that matters. Rovner argued precisely this point:\nThe conventional wisdom on the ill-fated Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act is that it was all a big mistake.…[F]inancially secure senior citizens rebelled when they realized they would have to pay for expanded benefits they felt they did not need. The real story of the rise and fall of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act sends several ominous messages about the state of Congress and our political system, but the power of the senior citizens’ lobby is not one of them. Those who lived through this nightmare instead learned a lot more about the power of direct mail, the ease of manipulating the public with information that is simply wrong, the resistance recipients of federal entitlement programs feel toward change, and the lack of knowledge Americans have about programs that so directly affect their lives. (1995, 145–6)\nThere is an additional and, in our view, critical lesson: The MCCA threatened the social contract established in 1965 in two ways, by advancing the concepts that Medicare benefits were no longer universally “earned” during one's working years and that the program would no longer treat all beneficiaries in a strictly equal manner. Thus, both the policy and process were important to sealing the fate of the MCCA.\nThe proposals advanced in 2003 reflected situational learning based on what Rovner called the “conventional wisdom” from the demise of the MCCA, whether accurate or not. Most significantly, none of the bills imposed the full costs of the new benefits on seniors themselves, as happened in 1988. Instead, the costs of the program were to be paid out of general revenues, enrollees’ premiums, and out-of-pocket expenses. Another lesson was that participation in the new prescription drug coverage had to be voluntary (Dallek 2003). In particular, it was crucial to avoid requiring Medicare beneficiaries to switch out of supplemental coverage that was heavily subsidized and with which they were satisfied (e.g., employee retirement programs). Policymakers also created upfront benefits in the form of a discount card and a lower deductible, whereas the benefits under the MCCA were scheduled to take effect after beneficiaries had begun paying premiums to build up financial reserves for the program (Himelfarb 1995, 86).\nMany provisions in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, however, were not consistent with the lessons learned from the demise of the MCCA. The incompleteness and complexity of the Part D benefits ensured that beneficiaries will be confused and that many of them will not see any improvement in their coverage (Bettelheim 2003; Pear 2003b; Stolberg 2003b). Indeed, many beneficiaries will be worse off if a large number of employers drop the prescription drug benefits that they currently offer to retirees. Beneficiaries may also react negatively when they learn that neither they nor their former employers may buy supplemental coverage for costs not covered by the Part D program (Pear 2003d). Finally, the law reintroduced the income-related premiums so detested in the MCCA as well as direct means testing for low-income subsidies. The law requires Medicare and private insurers to obtain information about beneficiaries’ income from the Internal Revenue Service or another source, something sure to raise concerns in many quarters (Bettelheim 2003). These are the logical outcomes of a process in which the price tag of reform is decided before the appropriate method of reform is settled on. Even if some of these outcomes are expected or easily explained, they may prove politically damaging for the proponents of this approach.\nThe proposals in 2003 also reflected the situational learning of the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Since the Nixon administration altered Medicaid's drug-purchasing practices, the industry has opposed most proposals to add prescription drug benefits to Medicare. The proposed rebates under the health security act only reinforced the industry's concerns. In recent years, the industry toned down its strident opposition and offered conditional support for adding Medicare drug benefits; yet it still vehemently resisted a centrally administered drug benefit. The influence of the pharmaceutical industry is one reason that most proposals called for a stand-alone drug benefit administered by pharmacy benefit managers or for formally integrating drug coverage into Medicare managed care plans.\nFrom 1965 to 1999, proposals to expand Medicare benefits always included prescription drugs with the rest of ambulatory medical services in the Part B program. The idea of a stand-alone drug benefit first surfaced in President Clinton's 1999 proposal and is an integral part of the legislation passed in 2003. In some ways, this form of administrative intermediary is no different from the original Medicare program in contracting out claims payments and other functions to private insurers for both Part A and Part B. The idea then, as now, was to make transactions between health care providers and the Medicare program mirror the transactions with private health plans or, more bluntly, to create a buffer between health care providers and the regulatory reach of the government (NASI 2002, 24; Oberlander 2003, 111–6). Even if pharmacy benefits managers use cost-saving mechanisms like formularies, volume discounts, and utilization review, they still are viewed as part of the “market” and are not as threatening to the pharmaceutical industry as a central governmental agency employing the same techniques would be. The industry believes it will have stronger negotiating power vis-à-vis private organizations and less regulatory oversight than it would if it had to deal directly with the federal government.\nThis sort of administrative fragmentation through benefit “carve-outs” has a short history, however: Pharmacy benefits managers appeared only in the past decade as employer-sponsored health plans struggled to contain the spiraling costs of prescription drugs for their beneficiaries. Without this institutional development, policymakers ideologically inclined to rely on the private sector's administration would not have had any experience on which to judge the viability of this approach. As it is, there are few examples of stand-alone drug plans that bear financial risk (CBO 2002), great uncertainty that insurers will actually participate in a Medicare drug benefit program (Goldstein 2003a, d; Health Policy Alternatives 2003a), and little evidence to date that they can control the costs of a major Medicare benefit (Lipton et al. 1999; Lipton et al. 2000). When serving as administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Thomas Scully contended in congressional testimony that stand-alone drug coverage “does not exist in nature” and would probably not work in practice (Pear 2003e). Hence, the use of private pharmacy benefits programs is based more on situational learning than on substantive learning from experience. Given the uncertainty, the conditions for offering a fallback prescription drug program to Medicare's fee-for-service enrollees were among the most contentious provisions of the new law.\nA final, powerful example of situational learning is based on the “managed care backlash” that began with rejection of the Clinton health plan in 1994 and culminated in the troubled experience of the Medicare+Choice program. Not only did the enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries in managed care plans drop from 6.3 million to 5.0 million between 2000 and 2002, but the reduction of prescription drug coverage in the remaining managed care plans added to the pressure for an explicit Medicare drug benefit program. Thus, despite Republican control across the federal government, both the House and Senate produced bills with relatively equivalent benefits available to Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of whether they enrolled in a managed care plan or remained in the government-administered fee-for-service program.\nThe withdrawals of Medicare+Choice plans from the Medicare program since 1998 persuaded policymakers that they could not rely on comprehensive private plans completely, especially in rural regions of the country, and that beneficiaries would strongly oppose efforts to make drug benefits contingent on joining a health plan that might limit their choice of providers or access to specialists. “Where is the line between financial incentives and economic coercion? Republicans are keenly aware that one of the most devastating accusations against President Bill Clinton's plan for universal health insurance was that it would force Americans into HMOs” (Pear and Toner 2003a). The heavy representation of rural states on the Senate Finance Committee ensured that it would adopt comparable benefits for the managed care and the fee-for-service programs (Toner 2003b), but in the end the House also agreed to adopt this approach in H.R. 1 to make the new program attractive to as many beneficiaries as possible.\nChallenges Still Ahead\nA general perception is that senior citizens are the preeminent political force in contemporary American politics. But the history of Medicare and prescription drug coverage teaches a different lesson. The elderly, like other interests, may be powerful defenders of their existing entitlements and benefits. But because of the politics of the federal budget and the command of key offices by conservative Republicans, the elderly alone do not have the capacity to gain improvements in the program. As we have shown, the history of Medicare from its inception in 1965 through the 2002 election campaign is littered with missed opportunities to add prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries.\nIn 2003 policymakers seized a historic opportunity to integrate prescription drug benefits into a program that 41 million older and disabled Americans admire and rely on. Despite this opportunity, the effort to establish a Medicare drug benefit was boxed in by current sources of coverage, by ideological insistence on market “solutions” for a massive social problem, by arbitrary budgetary constraints, and by the failure of managed care in rural America. The resulting program design may make it more difficult for Medicare administrators and private organizations to implement the policy successfully, satisfy the expectations of millions of Medicare beneficiaries, and protect the public purse. In our view, several challenges remain for those trying to implement the new law.\nFirst, the coverage itself will prove inadequate for large numbers of beneficiaries, particularly those who currently have no supplemental drug coverage. Although the new law promises immediate relief through a discount card program, those companies offering the cards are not required to achieve a minimum level of savings. Medicare officials estimate that only 7.3 million beneficiaries will sign up for the program (Pear 2003c). With more than 28 companies receiving federal approval to offer discount cards, it is not clear how beneficiaries will obtain information to choose the one that will save them the most on their individual prescription needs (Antos 2004; Freudenheim 2004; Pear 2004c).\nThe vast majority of the elderly have limited financial resources: 40 percent have household incomes below 200 percent of poverty, and 40 percent have assets under $12,000 (Kaiser Family Foundation 2004). Yet the law requires them to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in shared costs, except for those beneficiaries with very low incomes, and even they will still need to make out-of-pocket copayments for each prescription. This problem will be exacerbated if, as the Congressional Budget Office and other analysts expect, large numbers of employers who currently provide retiree benefits try to drop them once the Medicare benefits become available (CBO 2003, 22; Freudenheim 2003a). Any effort to improve the benefits, however, will almost certainly be stymied in the short run by fiscal concerns. Already, the White House Office of Management and Budget estimates the ten-year costs of the drug benefits to be $534 billion, or 30 percent higher than the estimates that legislators received from the Congressional Budget Office before casting their votes on H.R. 1 (CBO 2004b; Pear 2004a). Legislators who believe that the true costs of the new program were concealed are not likely to expand it further in the short term, particularly in the midst of record federal budget deficits.\nSecond, the new law takes only small steps to affect the quality and economy of physicians’ prescribing practices. It established the Medication Therapy Management Service (MTMS) provided by pharmacists or case managers, which was designed to ensure that the drugs covered are used appropriately to optimize therapeutic outcomes and reduce the risk of adverse reactions. The inclusion of MTMS is important because it recognizes the pharmacists’ contributions to reducing costs and improving outcomes. But the law does not clarify the scope of MTMS activities or guarantee that Medicare beneficiaries will have access to such services. Nor does it confer provider status on pharmacists and make sure that they will be adequately reimbursed by the new prescription drug plans. These and other critical details will need to be worked out in the regulatory process.\nThird, the legislation does not deal comprehensively with the need to control the cost of prescription drugs. There are no direct incentives to prescribe cost-effective drugs, only a provision that requires pharmacists to notify beneficiaries of the difference in price between a brand-name drug and a therapeutically equivalent generic drug. Both Republicans and Democrats share the hope that pharmacy benefit management companies or insurance companies will monitor prescribing patterns and encourage the use of lower-cost medicines, but there are no compelling data to demonstrate savings from the use of pharmacy benefit management in either managed care or fee-for-service programs (Lipton et al. 1999; Lipton et al. 2000). In fact, some pharmacy benefit managers have profited from their intermediary position but have not passed on these savings to the purchasers or beneficiaries (Martinez 2003). Many policymakers are ready to reconsider price controls if the savings promised under drug discount cards do not materialize. For the time being, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is planning to monitor prescription drug prices to ensure that prices do not rise inordinately as the discount program takes effect (Pear 2003c).\nIf the past patterns of policymaking hold true, the action that Congress and President Bush began in 2003 will be only the first step in a serial process of reform. Nearly every episode of Medicare reform—whether adding new benefits, controlling costs, or creating new delivery systems—requires several years of legislation and regulatory development before those elements become routine parts of the program (Oliver and Lee 2000, 54–9). Much work remains, therefore, before political leaders can claim to have solved the problems that pushed this issue to the top of the nation's domestic agenda.\nAcknowledgments\nThe original research for this article was supported in part by the Henry J.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, filed a bill to repeal the state’s decade-old law allowing some undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates to attend public universities in Texas.\nThe proposal didn’t get anywhere — Birdwell concedes that he was unable to wrangle enough votes to pass it out of the Senate Higher Education Committee — but the issue has become increasingly controversial.\nHeading into the 2013 session, which begins in January, Birdwell told The Texas Tribune that he intends to file the bill again. This time, because of changes in public sentiment and the makeup of the Texas Senate, he may have momentum in his favor.\nUnder the current law, signed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2001 and broadened in 2005, students may establish residency and qualify for in-state tuition if they graduate from a Texas high school, have lived in the state for three years before applying and sign an affidavit indicating their intent to apply for permanent residency status as soon as possible.\nBirdwell said his objections to the policy stem from his view of citizenship. “It is not intended to be harsh,” he said. “It is intended to affirm that I serve those that are citizens — black, white, pink, purple, I don’t care. Citizenship is the center of gravity.”\nHe also said the benefit of lower tuition could incentivize illegal activity rather than addressing the country’s immigration issues. “It’s conceding the failure of the federal government, so let’s get comfortable with it,” he said.\nSo far, the biggest barriers to Birdwell’s success have come from within the GOP, but an influx of new conservative senators may change that.\n“It’s a debated issue within our own party,” state Rep. Kelly Hancock, R-Fort Worth, acknowledged at a TribLive event last month featuring three incoming Republican senators — Hancock, Larry Taylor of Friendswood and Ken Paxton of McKinney.\nAll three said they would side with Birdwell on the issue.\n“I think the status quo is at risk because of the new members,” state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, a supporter of the current policy, recently told the Tribune.\nShe has also publicly speculated that the failure of Birdwell’s bill to pass out of the Higher Education Committee under her chairmanship may have influenced Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst’s decision, announced last week, to remove her from that position. Though, she said she would have allowed it to pass if it had the necessary votes.\nBirdwell, a retired U.S. Army officer, said that despite a more conservative Senate and changes in the committees, he is not taking victory for granted this session. “There are still too many unknowns to know the battle ahead,” he said. “I will enjoin the battle. But how the battlefield will be arrayed, I don’t know yet.”\nOne of the biggest questions is whether Perry, who has — to the ire of some conservatives — spoken out in favor of the state’s existing policy, will use his veto pen.\nIn an interview at The Texas Tribune Festival in September, Perry said the policy, which was not controversial when it passed in 2001, was the “correct economic decision for this state.” But he did not say outright that he would veto a bill to repeal it.\nHe said he was amenable to “an open and vigorous debate” on the matter but added, “My bet is that bill will never get to my desk to make a decision on.”\nPerry said lawmakers have a choice between helping successful students who were brought to Texas “through no fault of their own” to succeed or allowing them to become a drag on the state’s economy. “We have to deal with reality,” he said.\nThis week, Birdwell told the Tribune, “Those are correct arguments.” But he said that the fact remained that the policy creates a situation where the state provides an incentive for “conduct that’s illegal.”\n“There are many things I agree with Gov. Perry on,” Birdwell said. “I reserve the right to disagree, and this is obviously one in which we disagree, but my duty is to do what I’m compelled to do. If I succeed in getting it to his desk, if he’s compelled to sign it or veto it, it will be based on what is in his heart.”\nIf by veto or votes Birdwell is unsuccessful, then he can be expected to keep pushing in future sessions.\n“The bottom line is, you take these battles one day at a time, one session at a time, and many bills take several sessions to pass,” he said. “Ultimately, I see it as my duty to affirm my obligations to the citizens of Texas and the citizens of the United States, by virtue of Texas being a member of the Union. That’s precious.”\nTexas Tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories, or may be the subject of them.

Whereas it used to take the support of two-thirds of the senators present to bring up a measure, it now takes only three-fifths.\nThe move was more than an administrative adjustment. In a body split between 20 Republicans and 11 Democrats, the change in the threshold meant Republicans could bring up a bill and pass it without the support of any Democrats.\nSupporters, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who had pushed for the change for years, framed it as allowing Republican senators to implement the will of the voters. To critics, the shift was nothing less than a rejection of the Senate’s guiding principle, that finding consensus is the best path to writing good laws.\n“By forcing this rule change, the majority is escalating partisanship to a new level,” state Sen. José Rodríguez, D-El Paso, said at the time. “They are so concerned with getting an agenda accomplished and making good on campaign promises that they are willing to burn down the institutions and the traditions that made the Texas Senate one of the greatest deliberative bodies in the country.”\nFour months, later, the full impact of the first legislative session without the two-thirds rule has come into focus. Out of more than 700 bills voted out of the Senate so far, roughly 30 bills have moved forward with fewer than 21 senators, the threshold required under the two-thirds rule. Most of those measures were passed over the opposition of Democrats.\n“The 19-vote rule has allowed Republicans, the majority party, to pass legislation that has been blocked for many years,” Patrick said in a statement. “At the same time nearly 95% of legislation has passed with bi-partisan support.”\nThe rule works by placing what is called a “blocker bill” at the beginning of the Senate’s daily calendar, where it sits for the rest of the session. No other bill can be passed unless enough senators agree to “suspend the regular order of business” and skip over the blocker. With three-fifths of the Senate now required to move legislation forward, 19 senators must agree to move forward if all members are present.\nWhile not quite creating the conservative steamroller that Democrats had feared, the rule change has unblocked several of Patrick’s priority bills and moved them forward on party-line votes including:\n- Open carry — Senate Bill 17, from state Sen. Craig Estes, R-Wichita Falls, would allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry holstered handguns openly. The bill passed the Senate in March on a 20-11 vote. A similar measure passed the House. Both chambers are now working out differences to get a measure to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk.\n- Campus carry — Senate Bill 11, from state Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, requiring public colleges and universities to allow concealed handguns on campus, passed the Senate two days later on a 20-10 vote. The measure has failed to gain traction in the House.\n- Moving the public integrity unit — Senate Bill 10, from state Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, would move the state’s public integrity unit from the Travis County district attorney’s office to the Texas Rangers. Some Republicans have said the unit has had partisan motives for its prosecutions. The measure passed 20-11. The House has passed a similar measure, and backers are working on a compromise version.\n- A-F grading for schools — Senate Bill 6, authored by state Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, would have the state grade schools on an A-through-F scale, largely reflecting student academic performance on standardized tests. The measure passed 20-10. Language from Taylor’s bill was folded into a bill that recently passed the House.\nState Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, D–McAllen, said that the rule change has moved bills that are “partisan and socially divisive” but agreed with Patrick that most bills have been unaffected.\n“The majority of bills are not partisan, and most of those votes are based on public policy, based on merit and negotiations taking place among the various stakeholders and the senators,” Hinojosa said.\nYet the rule change has had a broader effect on the Senate as a whole, reducing the interest of Republicans to work on bills to build a broader coalition of support, argued state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin.\n“As a result of it, the idea that it’s a deliberative body really is not true anymore,” Watson said.\nState Sen. Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, warned against reading too much into which bills have moved forward this session on 19 or 20 votes. Some might have still managed to pass under the two-thirds rule.\n“You don’t know how hard the sponsor of that bill would have worked to turn votes,” Eltife said. “If the rule was 21 and I was stuck at 19, I’m going to work my tail off to find two more and turn them.”\nEven with the rule change, some measures championed by Patrick and other Republicans have still hit a brick wall. Two high-profile immigration proposals — one to repeal in-state tuition rates for undocumented immigrants and another to institute a so-called sanctuary cities ban that would stop cities from limiting the immigration enforcement powers of local law enforcement — remain in limbo because of opposition from Republicans including Eltife and Kel Seliger of Amarillo. Some school voucher measures championed by Patrick have also failed to come to the floor because of resistance from some rural Republicans.\nSeliger said the inability of those bills to move forward shows that the impact of the rule change hasn’t been as dramatic as many predicted.\n“Has it made a difference? Yes. Has it made a huge difference? No, I don’t think it has this session,” Seliger said. “It still doesn’t do everything that everyone wanted who wanted to have it reduced.”\nIronically, even Democrats have passed a few bills out of the Senate this session with the support of just 19 or 20 senators. One such bill, Senate Bill 1032 from Watson, would make it easier for some state employees to work from home and have more flexible work hours. Watson said the bill would improve employee retention and reduce rush hour traffic. While some Republicans worried that the policy would be abused, eight Republicans joined the chamber’s 11 Democrats to bring it up for debate last month. It passed and is now moving through the House.\n“That is a bill that in previous sessions, for whatever reason, would have died, and so be it,” Watson said.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Phone: 317-232-9779 | 1-800-382-9841\nPhone: 317-232-9779\nPhone: 1-800-382-9841\nPress Contact\nFor assistance, please email H30@iga.in.gov or call 317-232-9779.\nFor assistance, please email H30@iga.in.gov or call 317-232-9779.\nIndiana House of Representatives: 2010 - Present\nHouse District 30: Portions of Grant and Howard Counties\nTelephone:\n(317) 232-9651 - Direct Line\n(800) 382-9841 - Toll Free\nAddress:\n200 W.

At 9:40 p.m. local time, members of Ansar al-Sharia attacked the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi resulting in the deaths of both United States Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith.[1][2] At around 4:00 a.m. on September 12, the group launched a mortar attack against a CIA annex approximately one mile (1.6 km) away, killing two CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty[2][3][4] and wounding ten others. Initial analysis by the CIA, repeated by top government officials, indicated that the attack spontaneously arose from a protest.[5] Subsequent investigations showed that the attack was premeditated—although rioters and looters not originally part of the group may have joined in after the attacks began.[6][7][8][9]\nThere is no definitive evidence that al-Qaeda or any other international terrorist organization participated in the Benghazi attack.[10][11][12] The United States immediately increased security worldwide at diplomatic and military facilities and began investigating the Benghazi attack.[13][14] The Libyan Government condemned the attacks and took steps to disband the militias. 30,000 Libyans marched through Benghazi condemning Ansar al-Sharia, which had been formed after the 2011 Libyan civil war which toppled Muammar Gaddafi.[15][16][17]\nDespite persistent accusations against President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Susan Rice, ten investigations did not find that they or any other high-ranking Obama administration officials had acted improperly.[5][18][19][20] Four career State Department officials were criticized for denying requests for additional security at the facility prior to the attack. Eric J. Boswell, the Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security, resigned under pressure, while three others were suspended.[21] In her role as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton subsequently took responsibility for the security lapses.[22]\nOn August 6, 2013, it was reported that the United States had filed criminal charges against several individuals alleged to have been involved in the attacks, including militia leader Ahmed Abu Khattala.[23] Khattala has been described by both Libyan and United States officials as the Benghazi leader of Ansar al-Sharia. The United States Department of State designated Ansar al-Sharia as a terrorist organization in January 2014.[24][25][26] Khattala was captured in Libya by United States Army Special Operations Forces, who were acting in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in June 2014.[27] Another suspect, Mustafa al-Imam, was captured in October 2017.[28][29]\nBackground\n[edit]American presence in Libya and Benghazi\n[edit]The US had not had regular diplomatic presence in Libya since withdrawing its ambassador in 1972 and then closing its embassy after the 1979 U.S. embassy burning in Libya, but since the early 2000s had been starting to normalise relations. During Congressional hearings, Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens' top deputy in Libya, Gregory N. Hicks, testified that Ambassador Stevens was in Benghazi in 2012 because \"Secretary [of State Hillary] Clinton wanted the post made permanent\", and it was understood that the secretary hoped to make an announcement to that effect during a visit to Tripoli later in the year.[30][31][32][33][34] He also stated that \"Chris [Stevens] wanted to make a symbolic gesture to the people of Benghazi that the United States stood behind their dream of establishing a new democracy.\"[35][36]\nIn 2013, CNN reported that sources told it that around 35 US personnel were working in the diplomatic mission in Benghazi at the time of the attack, of whom around 21 were CIA agents.[37] Within months of the start of the Libyan revolution in February 2011, the CIA had begun building a covert presence in Benghazi.[38] During the war, elite counterterrorist operators from the United States Delta Force were deployed to Libya as analysts, instructing the rebels on specifics about weapons and tactics.[39]: 16\nJ. Christopher Stevens was named the first liaison with the Libyan opposition in March 2011.[40] After the end of the war, both the CIA and the United States' State Department were tasked with continuing to identify and collect arms that had flooded the country during the war, particularly shoulder-fired missiles taken from the arsenal of the Gaddafi regime,[41][42] as well as securing Libyan chemical weapons stockpiles, and helping to train Libya's new intelligence service.[38]\nEastern Libya and Benghazi were key intelligence-gathering hubs for intelligence operatives. Before the attack, the CIA was monitoring Ansar al-Sharia and suspected members of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as attempting to define the leadership and loyalty of the various militias present and their interaction with the Salafi elements of Libyan society.[38] By the time of the attack, dozens of CIA operatives were on the ground in Benghazi.[37] In addition, it has been reported that in the summer of 2012, American Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) missions had begun to target Libyan militias linked to the Al-Qaeda network of Yasin al-Suri.[39]: 58 By the time of the attack, a composite U.S. Special Operations team with two JSOC members was already in Libya working on their mission profile independently of the CIA and State Department operations.[39]: 58 [43]\nThere was some speculation that the diplomatic post in Benghazi was used by the CIA to smuggle weapons from Libya to anti-Assad rebels in Syria.[44][39]: 56 [37][45][46] Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh cites an anonymous former senior Defense Department Intelligence Official, saying \"The consulate's only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms. It had no real political role.\" The attack allegedly brought an end to the purported United States involvement, but did not stop the smuggling according to Hersh's source.[47]\nIn January 2014, the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence cast doubt on this alleged United States involvement and reported that \"All CIA activities in Benghazi were legal and authorized. On-the-record testimony establishes that the CIA was not sending weapons ... from Libya to Syria, or facilitating other organizations or states that were transferring weapons from Libya to Syria.\"[48]\nInstability in Benghazi\n[edit]In April 2012, two former security guards for the consulate threw an IED over the consulate fence; the incident did not cause any casualties.[49] Just four days later, a similar bomb was thrown at a four-vehicle convoy carrying the United Nations Special Envoy to Libya, exploding twelve feet (3.7 m) from the United Nations envoy's vehicle without injuring anyone.[50]\nIn May 2012, an Al-Qaida affiliate calling itself the \"Brigades of the Imprisoned Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman\" claimed responsibility for an attack on the International Red Cross (ICRC) office in Benghazi. On August 6, the ICRC suspended operations in Benghazi. The head of the ICRC's delegation in Libya said the aid group was \"appalled\" by the attack and \"extremely concerned\" about escalating violence in Libya.[51]\nThe Brigades of the Imprisoned Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman released a video of what it said was its detonation of an explosive device outside the gates of the U.S. consulate on June 6, which caused no casualties but blew a hole in the consulate's perimeter wall,[52][53] described by one individual as \"big enough for forty men to go through\".[54] The Brigades claimed that the attack was in response to the killing of Abu Yahya al Libi, a Libyan al-Qaeda leader who had just died in an American drone attack, and was also timed to coincide with the imminent arrival of a United States Diplomat.[55][56] There were no injuries, but the group left behind leaflets promising more attacks against the United States.[57]\nBritish Ambassador to Libya Dominic Asquith survived an assassination attempt in Benghazi on June 10, 2012. Two British protection officers were injured in the attack when their convoy was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade 300 meters from their consulate office.[58] The British Foreign Office withdrew all consular staff from Benghazi in late June 2012.[59][60]\nOn June 18, 2012, the Tunisian Consulate in Benghazi was attacked by individuals affiliated with Ansar al-Sharia, allegedly because of \"attacks by Tunisian artists against Islam\".[39]: 31\nOn the day of the attack, two consulate security guards spotted a man in a Libyan police uniform taking pictures of the consulate with his cell phone from a nearby building that was under construction. The security guards briefly detained the man before releasing him. He drove away in a police car and a complaint was made to the Libyan police station. Sean Smith noticed this surveillance, and messaged a friend online around noon, \"Assuming we don't die tonight. We saw one of our 'police' that guard the compound taking pictures.\"[39]: 34\nAccording to a local security official, he and a battalion commander had met with United States Diplomats three days before the attack and warned the Americans about deteriorating security in the area. The official told CNN that he advised the diplomats, \"The situation is frightening; it scares us.\"[61]\nAmbassador Stevens' diary, which was later found at the compound, recorded his concern about the growing al-Qaeda presence in the area and his worry about being on an al-Qaeda hit list.[62]\nUnited States Security Officer Eric Nordstrom twice requested additional security for the mission in Benghazi from the State Department. His requests were denied and according to Nordstrom, State Department Official Charlene Lamb wanted to keep the security presence in Benghazi \"artificially low\".[63]\nOn December 30, 2012, the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released a report, \"Flashing Red: A Special Report on the Terrorist Attack at Benghazi\", wherein it was determined:\nIn the months [between February 2011 and September 11, 2012] leading up to the attack on the Temporary Mission Facility in Benghazi, there was a large amount of evidence gathered by the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and from open sources that Benghazi was increasingly dangerous and unstable, and that a significant attack against American personnel there was becoming much more likely. While this intelligence was effectively shared within the Intelligence Community (IC) and with key officials at the Department of State, it did not lead to a commensurate increase in security at Benghazi nor to a decision to close the American mission there, either of which would have been more than justified by the intelligence presented. ... The RSO [Regional Security Officer] in Libya compiled a list of 234 security incidents in Libya between June 2011 and July 2012, 50 of which took place in Benghazi.[64]\nThe desire of the State Department to maintain a low profile in Benghazi has been cited as the reason why the State Department circumvented their own Overseas Security Policy Board (OSPB) standards for diplomatic security.[65]: 74–75 In the aftermath, Clinton sought to take responsibility for the security lapses at Benghazi and expressed personal regret.[66] In her January 2013 testimony before Congress, Secretary Clinton claimed security decisions at the Benghazi compound had been made by others, stating, \"The specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi ... were handled by the security professionals in the [State] Department. I didn't see those requests, I didn't approve them, I didn't deny them.\"[67]\nAttack\n[edit]The Benghazi attack was conducted by separate military factions on two separate United States compounds.[68] The first assault occurred at the main diplomatic compound, approximately 300 yards (270 m) long and 100 yards (91 m) wide, at about 9:40 p.m. local time (3:40 p.m. Eastern Time). A mortar fire attack on a CIA annex 1.2 miles (1.9 km) away began at about 4:00 a.m. the following morning[69] and lasted for 11 minutes.[70]\nAssault on the compound\n[edit]A Libyan guard who was wounded in the attack later said \"there wasn't a single ant outside [before the attack].\"[71] According to Media Matters For America, the attackers stated they were acting in response to Innocence of Muslims.[72] This was known to be false at the time and was used to support the lie and cover-up that this was a terrorist attack.[citation needed] No more than seven Americans were in the compound, including Ambassador Stevens.[citation needed]\nStevens was visiting Benghazi at the time to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital.[73] The ambassador also \"needed to [prepare a] report ... on the physical and the political and security environment in Benghazi to support an action memo to convert Benghazi from a temporary facility to a permanent facility\".[30][31][32][33][34] Surplus funds originally dedicated for use in Iran for fiscal year 2012 were to be redirected and obligated for use in Benghazi: an action that had to be completed before the end of the fiscal year—September 30, 2012.[30][31][33][34]\nStevens had his last meeting of the day with a Turkish diplomat (Consul General Ali Sait Akın), and escorted the Turkish diplomat to the main gate at about 8:30 p.m. local time. The street outside the compound was calm, and the State Department reported no unusual activity during the day outside.[74] Stevens retired to his room at about 9:00 p.m.[75]\nAbout 9:40 p.m. local time, large numbers of armed men shouting \"Allāhu Akbar\" (God is great) approached the compound from multiple directions.[71][76] They then threw grenades over the wall and entered the compound with automatic weapons fire, RPGs, and heavier weapons.[77][75] A Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent viewed on the consulate's security cameras \"a large number of men, armed men, flowing into the compound\".[74] He hit the alarm and started shouting, \"Attack! Attack!\" over the loudspeaker.[78] Phone calls were made to the embassy in Tripoli, the Diplomatic Security Command Center in Washington, the February 17th Martyrs Brigade and a U.S. quick reaction force located at the annex compound a little more than a mile (1.6 km) away.[79][80]\nDiplomatic Security Service Special Agent Scott Wickland secured Stevens and Sean Smith, an information management officer, in the main building's safe haven.[80][81] The rest of the agents left to retrieve their weapons and tried to return to the main building.[80] The attackers entered the main building and attempted to enter the safe haven.[78] They then spread diesel fuel in the room and set fires.[78][80] Stevens, Smith, and Wickland moved to the nearby bathroom, but then decided to leave the safe haven after being overcome by smoke.[81] Wickland exited through the window, but Stevens and Smith did not follow him. Wickland (who was severely wounded by gunfire) returned several times but could not find them in the smoke; he went up to the roof and radioed other agents.[81] Three agents returned to the main building in an armored vehicle, searched the building and found Smith's body, but not Stevens.[81]\nAccording to the Annex Security Team, they had become aware of the consulate attack after 9:30 p.m. local time, and were ready to respond; however, they were delayed by \"the top CIA officer in Benghazi\".[82][83] The Regional Security Office sounded the alarm and called to the Benghazi CIA annex and the embassy in Tripoli. After some discussion, the CIA's Global Response Staff (GRS) at the CIA annex, which included Tyrone S. Woods, decided to attempt a rescue. By 10:05 p.m., the team was briefed and loaded into their armored Toyota Land Cruisers. By this time, communicators at the CIA annex were notifying the chain of command about current developments, and a small CIA and JSOC element in Tripoli that included Glen Doherty was attempting to find a way to Benghazi.[39]: 39–43\nThe GRS team from the CIA annex arrived at the consulate and attempted to secure the perimeter and locate the ambassador and Sean Smith. Diplomatic security agent David Ubben located Smith,[84] who was unconscious and later declared dead, but the team was unable to find Stevens in the smoke-filled building. The team then decided to return to the annex with the survivors and Smith's body. While en route back to the annex, the group's armored vehicle was hit by AK-47 rifle fire and hand grenades. The vehicle was able to make it to its destination with two flat tires, and the gates to the annex were closed behind them at 11:50 p.m.[39]: 43–45 [69]\nThe US military had mobilized three separate teams to respond to the attack including EUCOM's CIF (Commander's-in-Extremis Force, a specialized direct action/hostage rescue team made up of US Special Forces soldiers)[85] from central Europe, a Marine Security Force Regiment team from Rota, Spain, and an unnamed special operations forces team which was in the US at the time. At the time, AFRICOM, which is responsible for operations in Africa, was the only combatant command which did not have its own CIF team thus having to request EUCOM's assistance. These teams were sent to Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily, Italy as a staging point on the night of the attack but did not deploy to Benghazi. United States officials stated the teams arrived at Sigonella after the attack was over.[86][87]\nReaction in the United States\n[edit]Diplomatic Security Service agents/Regional Security Officers informed their headquarters in Washington about the attack just as it was beginning at about 9:40 p.m. local time (3:40 p.m. Eastern Time (ET)).[citation needed] At the time, they were informed that the attack was a \"terrorist attack\".[88][verification needed]\nHowever, through September 14, CIA analysts made a contradictory assessment, stating \"We believe based on currently available information that the attacks in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. Consulate and subsequently its annex. The crowd almost certainly was a mix of individuals from across many sectors of Libyan society. That being said, we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack.\"[89]\nBy 4:30 p.m. ET, Pentagon officials had informed Defense Secretary Leon Panetta about the attack. The Pentagon ordered an unmanned aerial vehicle that was in the air conducting surveillance on militant camps to fly over Benghazi. The drone arrived at 11:10 p.m. local time (5:10 p.m. ET) and began providing a video feed to Washington. At 5:41 p.m. ET, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton telephoned CIA Director David Petraeus to coordinate. The CIA, which made up most of the U.S. government's presence in Benghazi, had a ten-member security team at its annex and the State Department believed that this team would assist the consulate in the event of an attack.[90]\nAssault on the CIA annex\n[edit]Just after midnight, the CIA annex came under machine gun, rocket and mortar fire. The CIA defenders held off the attack until the morning.[39]: 45–46 That same morning, Libyan government forces met up with a group of Americans, reinforcements from Tripoli including Glen Doherty,[91][92] that had arrived at the Benghazi airport. The team, which included two active-duty JSOC operators and five CIA personnel, had commandeered a small jet in Tripoli by paying the pilots $30,000 and forcing them to fly to Benghazi.[39]: 43 After being held up at the airport for a few hours, the Libyan forces and newly arrived Americans went to the CIA annex at about 5:00 a.m. to assist in transporting approximately 32 Americans at the annex back to the airport for evacuation. Minutes after they drove through the gates, the annex came under heavy fire. With a lull in the fighting, Doherty began searching for his friend, Tyrone S. Woods, and he was told he was on the roof. He found Woods on the roof with two other agents. A mortar round then hit Woods' position, fatally wounding him. As Doherty attempted to reposition and take cover, a second round fell on him, killing him.[39]: 46–47 [93] 31-year-old Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent David Ubben and 46-year-old CIA contractor Mark Geist suffered shrapnel injuries and several broken bones in the mortar attacks.[94]\nImmediately, several agents ran onto the roof to assess damage and help the wounded. At the same time, a JSOC operator was using a hand-held device displaying images from a Predator drone above, which had been sent by the DOD's US Africa Command after request. The defenders agreed to evacuate to the airport and were attacked with small arms fire along the route.[39]: 47–48 The evacuation of about 30 Americans included six State Department personnel and Smith's body—they were unable to locate Ambassador Stevens at the time.\nRecovery of Ambassador Stevens\n[edit]Ambassador Stevens' body was found by a group of Libyans who had accessed the room through a window.[95] They were unaware of his identity, and Abdel-Qader Fadl, a freelance photographer who was with them, told the Associated Press that Stevens was unconscious and \"maybe moved his head, but only once\". Ahmed Shams, a 22-year-old arts student, told the Associated Press that they were happy when they found Stevens alive and tried to rescue him. A freelance videographer, Fahd al-Bakoush, later published a video[96][97] showing Libyans trying to extract the ambassador from a smoke-filled room,[98][99] where he was found unconscious. According to al-Bakoush, the Libyans saw he was alive and breathing, his eyelids flickering. Though they took him to be a foreigner, no one recognized him as Stevens.[95][96]\nAt around 1:00 a.m., Stevens was taken to the Benghazi Medical Center, a hospital controlled by the Ansar Al-Sharia militia,[100] in a private car as there was no ambulance to carry him.[101] There he was administered CPR for 90 minutes by Dr. Ziad Abu Zeid.[102] According to Dr. Zeid, Stevens died from asphyxiation caused by smoke inhalation, and had no other apparent injuries.[103] The doctor said he believed that officers from the Libyan Interior Ministry transported the body to the airport. State Department officials said they do not know who took Stevens to the hospital or transported the body to the airport and into U.S. custody.[103]\nEvacuation\n[edit]The bodies were taken to Benina International Airport and flown to the capital, Tripoli, and then to Ramstein Air Base in Germany aboard a C-17 military transport aircraft.[104] From Germany, the four bodies arrived at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., where President Barack Obama and members of his cabinet held a ceremony in honor of those killed.\nAfter the attack, all diplomatic staff were moved to the capital, Tripoli, with nonessential personnel to be flown out of Libya. Sensitive documents remained missing, including documents listing the names of Libyans working with the Americans, and documents relating to oil contracts.[105]\nFatalities and injuries\n[edit]Four Americans died in the attack: Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Information Officer Sean Smith,[106] and two CIA operatives,[4] Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods,[107] both former Navy SEALs.[108][109] Stevens was the first United States ambassador killed in an attack since Adolph Dubs was killed in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1979.[110]\nResponsibility\n[edit]On September 10, 2012, at least 18 hours before the attack in Benghazi, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video to coincide with the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in 2001, which called for attacks on Americans in Libya in order to avenge the death of Abu Yahya al-Libi in a drone strike in Pakistan in June 2012.[111] It is uncertain how much prior knowledge of the attack al-Zawahiri had, though he praised the attackers on October 12, 2012, in another video.[112] On September 14, 2012, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a statement arguing the attack was revenge for the death of al-Libi, though they did not claim official responsibility for the Benghazi attack.[111] It was later reported that 3 operatives from the group did take part in the attack.[111] Furthermore, an intercepted phone call from the Benghazi area immediately after the attack reportedly linked senior Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb commander Mokhtar Belmokhtar to the attack.[113]\nDavid Kirkpatrick of The New York Times reported that 20-year-old neighbor Mohamed Bishari witnessed the attack. According to Bishari, it was launched without warning or protest and was led by the Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia (different from the group called Ansar al-Sharia based in Yemen designated by the U.N. and the U.S. Department of State as a terrorist organization[114]). Kirkpatrick reported that Ansar al-Sharia said they were launching the assault in retaliation for the release of the anti-Islamic video, Innocence of Muslims.[115][116] It was further reported that Ahmed Abu Khattala was called a ringleader of the attack by both witnesses and authorities, though he insisted he did not play a part in the aggression at the American compound. Witnesses, Benghazi residents, and Western news reports have described him as a leader of Ansar al-Sharia, though he stated he was close to the group but not an official part of it. He further stated he was the commander of an Islamist brigade, Abu Obaida ibn al-Jarrah, some of whose members had joined Ansar al-Sharia.[8]\nThe Brigades of the Imprisoned Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, a pro-al-Qaeda militia calling for the release of The Blind Sheikh, was implicated in the attack by Noman Benotman of the Quilliam Foundation.[117][118][119] CNN,[117] the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,[120] Commentary Magazine[119] and The Daily Telegraph[118] have listed this group as a chief suspect. USA Today reported that protests in Cairo that preceded the attack on Benghazi were intended to protest the imprisonment of Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman and announced as early as August 30.[121][122] Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi had called for release of the Blind Sheikh in his inaugural address.[122]\nIn the days and weeks following the attack, President Obama and other administration officials correctly noted that the Innocence of Muslims video had sparked violent incidents at a number of U.S. diplomatic facilities, and Susan Rice stated — based on a flawed CIA assessment[89] — that the attack \"began spontaneously\" after a violent protest at the American embassy in Cairo, Egypt hours earlier. During the hours before the attack, Egyptian satellite television networks popular in Benghazi had been covering the outrage over the video.[123] In a phone call with the Egyptian prime minister Kandil the day after the attack, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said \"we know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.\"[124] This assessment reflected information in an email sent by the State Department Operations Center to the White House, Pentagon, intelligence community and FBI at 6:07pm Eastern time the night of the attack, the subject line of which read, \"Update 2: Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack.\"[125] However, on the same day of the Clinton phone call, Ansar al-Sharia issued a statement saying it \"didn't participate as a sole entity; rather, it was a spontaneous popular uprising in response to what happened by the West,\" an apparent reference to the release of the video.[126][127]\nHowever, this assessment contradicted the assessment of CIA analysts, which through September 16 maintained that \"the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo,\" at which violent protesters had scaled the embassy walls.[128] And the day after the attack, Ansar al-Sharia appeared to confirm both assessments when it issued a statement saying The [Ansar al-Shariah] Brigade didn't participate as a sole entity; rather, it was a spontaneous popular uprising in response to what happened by the West,\" which was an apparent reference to the Innocence of Muslims video.[127]\nA later report from an independent review board concluded \"there was no protest prior to the attacks.\"[129]\nIn a September 18 appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, President Obama said, \"extremists and terrorists used (the anti-Muslim YouTube video) as an excuse to attack a variety of our embassies.\"[130] Obama spoke accurately, because five American embassies were the sites of violent protests due to the video, but Benghazi was not an embassy, it was a \"diplomatic post.\" In his Univision Town Hall appearance on September 20, President Obama said that the \"natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.\"[131] The Innocence of Muslims video triggered dozens of protests from northwest Africa to southeast Asia, including violent protests at American embassies in Tunis, Khartoum, Cairo, Sana and Jakarta.[132]\nIn October 2012, a Tunisian, Ali Harzi, who a U.S. intelligence official stated had links to Ansar al-Sharia and al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, was arrested in Turkey and repatriated to Tunisia on terrorism charges and possible links to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.[133] Ali Harzi was released by Tunisian authorities on January 8, 2013, because of a lack of evidence.[134]\nAlso in October, a Libyan suspect, Karim el-Azizi, who had recently returned to Egypt from Libya and was storing weapons in his hideout, detonated a bomb and was found dead in his apartment after clashes with security forces.[135] He has been linked to an Egyptian terrorist group led by Muhammad Jamal Abu Ahmad, who is suspected of training some of the terrorists responsible for the Benghazi attack in camps in the Libyan desert.[136] Jamal Abu Ahmad, a former member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, was released from Egyptian prison after the fall of the Mubarak regime, after which he began assembling a terrorist network.[137] He received financing from the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, petitioned Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to establish a new Al-Qaeda affiliate he called al-Qaeda in Egypt,[136][137] and was subsequently detained by Egyptian authorities in December 2012.[137]\nOn October 7, 2013, the Muhammad Jamal network (MJN) and Muhammad Jamal were designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists by the U.S. Department of State, which noted in its designation that \"Jamal has developed connections with al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), AQ senior leadership, and al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) leadership including Nasir 'Abd-al-Karim 'Abdullah al-Wahishi and Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Rimi\".[138] A few days later, on October 21, 2013, the United Nations Security Council designated the Muhammad Jamal network \"as being associated with Al-Qaida\".[139] The United Nations Security Council also noted, \"Some of the attackers of the U.S. Mission in Benghazi on 11 September 2012 have been identified as associates of Muhammad Jamal, and some of the Benghazi attackers reportedly trained at MJN camps in Libya.\"[140]\nIn March 2013, Faraj al-Shibli was detained by Libyan authorities and questioned by the FBI because of his suspected involvement in the Benghazi attack.[141] Al-Shibli was detained after he returned from a trip to Pakistan, though his exact role in the attack is unclear. He was a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which tried to overthrow the Gadhafi regime in the mid-1990s. Investigators have learned he has had contact with both the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Al-Qaeda members in Pakistan. He was released by Libyan authorities on June 12, 2013, based on claims there was a lack of evidence to hold him in custody.[142] In July 2014 he was found dead in Libya.[143]\nAftermath\n[edit]Libyan response\n[edit]Libyan Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur's office condemned the attack and extended condolences, saying: \"While strongly condemning any attempt to abuse the person of Muhammad, or an insult to our holy places and prejudice against the faith, we reject and strongly condemn the use of force to terrorize innocent people and the killing of innocent people.\" It also reaffirmed \"the depth of relationship between the peoples of Libya and the U.S., which grew closer with the positions taken by the U.S. government in support of the revolution of February 17\".[144] Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf, the President of the General National Congress of Libya, said: \"We apologize to the U.S., to the American people and to the government and also to the rest of the world for what happened yesterday. And at the same time, we expect the world to cooperate with us to confront to what is meant out of this kind of act of cowardice.\"[145]\nThere were demonstrations in Benghazi[146] and Tripoli[147] on September 12, condemning the violence and holding signs such as \"Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans\", \"Benghazi is against terrorism\", and other signs apologizing to Americans for the actions in their name and in the name of Muslims. On the same day, Libya's Deputy Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ahmad Jibril told the BBC that Ansar Al-Sharia was behind the attack.[148][149] On September 13, at a U.S. State Department reception in Washington D.C., the Libyan ambassador to the U.S. Ali Aujali apologized to Secretary of State Clinton for \"this terrorist attack which took place against the American consulate in Libya\".[149][150] The ambassador further praised Stevens as a \"dear friend\" and a \"real hero\". He also urged the United States to continue supporting Libya as it went \"through a very difficult time\" and that the young Libyan government needed help so that it could \"maintain ... security and stability in our country\".[150]\nIn the days after the attack, The New York Times stated that young Libyans had flooded Twitter with pro-American messages after the attacks.[147] Think Progress stated that Libyans are typically more positively inclined towards the United States than their neighbors.[151] A 2012 Gallup poll noted that \"A majority of Libyans (54%) surveyed in March and April 2012 approve of the leadership of the U.S.—among the highest approval Gallup has ever recorded in the ... region, outside of Israel.\"[152] Another poll in Eastern Libya, taken in 2011, reported that the population was at the same time both deeply religious conservative Muslims and very pro-American, with 90% of respondents reporting favorable views of the United States.[153][154]\nThe Libyan response to the crisis was praised and appreciated in the United States, and President Obama emphasized how the Libyans \"helped our diplomats to safety\" to an American audience the following day,[15] while a New York Times editorial criticized Egypt's government for not doing \"what Libyan leaders did\".[155]\nOn September 16, Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf said that the attack on the United States consulate was planned months in advance,[156] and further stated that \"[t]he idea that this criminal and cowardly act was a spontaneous protest that just spun out of control is completely unfounded and preposterous. We firmly believe that this was a precalculated, preplanned attack that was carried out specifically to attack the U.S. consulate.\"[157]\nAnti-militia demonstrations\n[edit]On September 21, about 30,000 Libyans marched through Benghazi calling for support of the rule of law and for an end to the armed militias that had formed during the Libyan Civil War to oppose Colonel Gaddafi.[16][17] After that war, the militias failed to disband, and continually menaced the Libyan government and populace.[17] Carrying signs with slogans such as \"We Want Justice For Chris\" and \"Libya Lost a Friend\", the protestors stormed several militia headquarters, including that of Ansar al-Sharia, an Islamist militia who some allege played a role in the attack on U.S. diplomatic personnel on September 11.[158][159] At least 10 people were killed and dozens more wounded as militiamen fired on demonstrators at the headquarters of Sahaty Brigade, a pro-government militia \"operating under the authority of the ministry of defence\".[16][159][160]\nBy early next morning, the protestors had forced militia members to flee and seized control of a number of compounds, releasing four prisoners found inside.[158][159] Protesters burnt a car and a building of at least one facility, and looted weapons.[16][17][159] The militia compounds and many weapons were handed over to Libya's national army[17] in what \"appeared to be part of a coordinated sweep of militia bases by police, government troops and activists\" following the earlier demonstrations.[158][159] Some militia members accused the protestors of being Gaddafi loyalists, looking to disarm the militias in the wake of the revolution.[17]\nGovernment campaign to disband militias\n[edit]On September 23, taking advantage of the growing momentum and rising anger against the militias evinced in the earlier anti-militia demonstrations,[161] the Libyan president declared that all unauthorized militias had 48 hours to either disband or come under government control.[162][163] The government also mandated that bearing arms in public was now illegal, as were armed checkpoints.[163]\nHandling the militias had been difficult as the government had been forced to rely on some of them for protection and security.[161][162] According to a Libyan interviewed in Tripoli, the government gained the ability to push back against the militias because of a \"mandate of the people\".[162] On September 24, the government commenced with a raid on a former military base held by a rogue infantry militia.[164]\nAcross the country, militias began surrendering to the government. The government formed a \"National Mobile Force\" for the purpose of evicting illegal militias.[165] On the same day as the declaration, various militias in Misrata held meetings, ultimately deciding to submit to the government's authority, and handed over various public facilities they had been holding, including the city's three main jails, which were handed over to the authority of the Ministry of Justice.[162] Hours before the announcement, in Derna, the two main militias (one of them Ansar al-Sharia) active in the city both withdrew, leaving both their five military bases behind.[161][162][165]\nHundreds of Libyans, mainly former rebel fighters, gathered in the city centers of Tripoli and Benghazi to hand over their weapons to the government on September 29.[166] The campaign has been less successful in other areas, such as the remote Nafusa Mountains, inhabited by the Nafusi-speaking Berber minority, where the Emirati news agency The National reported on September 23 that arms were being hoarded. The National also reported arms being hoarded in Misrata, despite simultaneous reporting by other outlets that militias were surrendering in Misrata.[167]\nU.S. government response\n[edit]On September 12, U.S. President Barack Obama condemned \"this outrageous attack\" on U.S. diplomatic facilities[169] and stated that \"since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others.\"[169] After referring to \"the 9/11 attacks\", \"troops who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan\", and \"then last night, we learned the news of this attack in Benghazi\"[169] the President urged, \"As Americans, let us never, ever forget that our freedom is only sustained because there are people who are willing to fight for it, to stand up for it, and in some cases, lay down their lives for it.\"[169] He then went on to say,\nNo acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.[169]\nAfter the attack, Obama ordered that security be increased at all such facilities worldwide.[13] A 50-member Marine FAST team was sent to Libya to \"bolster security\".[170][171] It was announced that the FBI would investigate the possibility of the attack being planned.[172] U.S. officials said surveillance over Libya would increase, including the use of unmanned drones, to \"hunt for the attackers\".[172]\nSecretary of State Clinton also made a statement on September 12, describing the perpetrators as \"heavily armed militants\" and \"a small and savage group—not the people or government of Libya\".[173] She also reaffirmed \"America's commitment to religious tolerance\" and said \"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,\" but whether true or not, that was not a justification for violence.[174] The State Department had previously identified embassy and personnel security as a major challenge in its budget and priorities report.[175]\nOn September 12, it was reported that the United States Navy dispatched two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, USS McFaul and USS Laboon, to the Libyan coast.[176] The destroyers are equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. American UAVs were also sent to fly over Libya to search for the perpetrators of the attack.[177]\nIn a speech on September 13, in Golden, Colorado, President Obama paid tribute to the four Americans \"killed in an attack on our diplomatic post in Libya\", stating,\nWe enjoy our security and our liberty because of the sacrifices they make ... I want people around the world to hear me: To all those who would do us harm, no act of terror will go unpunished. It will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world.[178]\nIn his press briefing on September 14, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that \"we don't have and did not have concrete evidence to suggest that this [the Benghazi attack] was not in reaction to the film.\"[179] He went on to say:\nThere was no intelligence that in any way could have been acted on to prevent these attacks. It is—I mean, I think the DNI spokesman was very declarative about this that the report is false. The report suggested that there was intelligence that was available prior to this that led us to believe that this facility would be attacked, and that is false ... We have no information to suggest that it was a preplanned attack. The unrest we've seen around the region has been in reaction to a video that Muslims, many Muslims find offensive. And while the violence is reprehensible and unjustified, it is not a reaction to the 9/11 anniversary that we know of, or to U.S. policy.\nOn September 14, the remains of the slain Americans were returned to the U.S.; President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the ceremony. In her remarks Clinton said, \"One young woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said 'Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam.' The President of the Palestinian Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring—and I quote—'an act of ugly terror.'\"[150] She went on to say: \"We've seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men.\"\nOn September 16, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice appeared on five major interview shows to discuss the attacks. Prior to her appearance, Rice was provided with \"talking points\" from a CIA memo,[180] which stated:\nThe currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex. There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.\nThis assessment may change as additional information is collected and analyzed and as currently available information continues to be evaluated.\nThe investigation is ongoing, and the U.S. government is working with Libyan authorities to bring to justice those responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens.[181]\nUsing these talking points as a guide, Rice stated:\nBased on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy—sparked by this hateful video. But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that— in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent. We do not—we do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned. I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al Qaeda affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al Qaeda itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine.[182][183][184][185][186]\nSince Rice's five television appearances, there have been persistent accusations that she had intentionally and repeatedly lied. However, none of the ten Benghazi investigations determined she had. For example, the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee \"did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people,\" according to the Associated Press.[5]\nIn a White House press briefing on September 18, press secretary Jay Carney explained the attack to reporters: \"I'm saying that based on information that we—our initial information, and that includes all information—we saw no evidence to back up claims by others that this was a preplanned or premeditated attack; that we saw evidence that it was sparked by the reaction to this video. And that is what we know thus far based on the evidence, concrete evidence.\"[187]\nOn September 20, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney answered a question about an open hearing with the National Counterterrorism Center Director, Matthew G. Olsen, which referenced which extremist groups might have been involved. Carney said, \"It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials. So, again, that's self-evident.\"[188] On the same day, during an appearance on Univision, a Spanish-language television network in the United States, President Obama stated, \"What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.\"[189][190][191][192][193]\nAlso on September 20, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a classified briefing to U.S. Senators,[194] which several Republican attendees criticized.[195] According to the article, senators were angered at the Obama administration's rebuff of their attempts to learn details of the Benghazi attack, only to see that information published the next day in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\nOn September 24, advertisements condemning an anti-Islam video appeared on Pakistani television. The television ads in Pakistan (marked with the U.S. Embassy seal) feature clips of President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton during press appearances in Washington in which they condemned the video. Their words were subtitled in Urdu.[196]\nOn September 25, in an address before the United Nations General Assembly President Obama stated, \"The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America ... And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice.\"[73][197] He referred to Innocence of Muslims as \"a crude and disgusting video [that] sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world\". He said, \"I have made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity.\"[198] He further stated, \"There is no video that justifies an attack on an Embassy.\"[199]\nOn September 26, Clinton acknowledged a possible link between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Benghazi attack.[200]\nOn September 28, a spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence stated,\nIn the immediate aftermath, there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress ... As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists. It remains unclear if any group or person exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist group leaders directed their members to participate.[201]\nAlso on September 28, it was reported that Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the producer of the Innocence of Muslims video, had been arrested in California and was being held without bail for alleged probation violations stemming from a 2010 bank fraud conviction.[202]\nOn CNN's State of the Union with Candy Crowley on September 30, Crowley observed that \"Friday we got the administration's sort of definitive statement that this now looks as though it was a pre-planned attack by a terrorist group, some of whom were at least sympathetic to al Qaeda,\" and asked the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator John McCain, \"why do you think and are you bothered that it has taken them this long from September 11th to now to get to this conclusion?\" to which McCain replied that \"it interferes with the depiction that the administration is trying to convey that al Qaeda is on the wane ... how else could you trot out our U.N. ambassador to say this was a spontaneous demonstration? ... It was either willful ignorance or abysmal intelligence to think that people come to spontaneous demonstrations with heavy weapons, mortars, and the attack goes on for hours.\"[203]\nOn October 4, 22 days after the attack, FBI investigators were finally allowed access to the scene of the attack.[204] The crime scene was not secured during that time; neither American nor Libyan investigators were able to secure the scene. The hearing testimony revealed that \"Hicks argued that Rice's comments so insulted the Libyan president—since they contradicted his Sept. 16 claims that the attack was premeditated—that it slowed the FBI's investigation. 'President Magariaf was insulted in front of his own people, in front of the world. His credibility was reduced,' Hicks said, adding that the president was apparently 'still steamed' two weeks later.\"[205]\nTo assist the Libyan government in disbanding extremist groups, the Obama administration allocated $8 million to begin building an elite Libyan commando force over the next year.[206]\nIn the Presidential debate of October 16, 2012, between President Obama and Mitt Romney, Romney claimed that \"it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.\" President Obama responded, \"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened,\" Obama said. \"That this was an act of terror, and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.\"[207] When Romney challenged Obama, asking \"You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?\" the President responded, \"Please proceed, governor\" and \"Get the transcript.\" The moderator of the debate, Candy Crowley, agreed, stating \"He—he did call it an act of terror.\" A CNN analysis stated that Obama had indeed referred to the incident as a \"terrorist attack\", but that Romney was correct in noting that the administration delayed in conclusively stating that the attack was not a spontaneous protest related to the video.[208] A May 14, 2013 Fact Checker by Glenn Kesler said that \"Immediately after the attack, the president three times used the phrase \"act of terror\" in public statements.\"[209]\nOn October 19, 2012, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) came under fire from intelligence officials in the Obama administration when he posted, on a public website, 166 pages of sensitive but unclassified State Department communications related to Libya. According to officials, the release of the unredacted documents compromised the identities of several Libyans working with the U.S. government and placed their lives in danger.[210]\nOn CBS's Face the Nation on October 28, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) stated that \"this is either a massive cover-up or incompetence\" and suggested that it was a scandal worse than Watergate. McCain stated, \"we know that there were tapes, recordings inside the consulate during this fight ... So the president went on various shows, despite what he said in the Rose Garden, about terrorist acts, he went on several programs, including The View, including Letterman, including before the UN where he continued to refer, days later, many days later, to this as a spontaneous demonstration because of a hateful video. We know that is patently false. What did the president know? When did he know it? And what did he do about it?\"[211] CBS News reported earlier on October 24 that the video of the assault was not recovered until 20 days after the attack, from the more than 10 security cameras at the compound.[87] In a radio interview October 29, 2012, Senator John McCain said that the surveillance tapes had been classified top secret.[212]\nSecretary Clinton was scheduled to testify before Congress on December 20 about the attack. On December 15, it was reported that she had become dehydrated from the flu, fainted, and sustained a concussion. Consequently, her testimony was postponed.[213] The incident prompted Republican Rep. Allen West to claim that the illness was a ruse intended to avoid testifying. Former UN Ambassador John Bolton called the concussion a \"diplomatic illness\".[214]\nOn January 23, 2013, during testimony at a Senate hearing on Benghazi, Clinton engaged in a heated exchange with Senator Ron Johnson. When Johnson pressed her to explain why, in the immediate aftermath, no one from the State Department had asked American evacuees if there had been a protest before the attack, Clinton replied:\nWith all due respect, the fact is, we had four dead Americans! Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they'd go kill some Americans?! What difference, at this point, does it make?! It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The [Intelligence Community] has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out. But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we'll figure out what was going on in the meantime.[215]\nIn March 2013, Representative Duncan D. Hunter introduced legislation into the 113th Congress to authorize awarding of Congressional Gold Medals to Doherty and Woods for their actions that led to their deaths.[216]\nIn April 2013, the Pentagon announced the activation of a USMC quick response force for North Africa that would use the range and speed of the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey to be able to respond to similar events in the future.[217] Spain authorized the basing of the quick response force at Morón Air Base near Seville, for a temporary one-year term.[218]\nOn May 13, 2013, President Obama stated during a news conference, \"The day after it happened, I acknowledged that this was an act of terrorism.\" This claim was disputed by Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post in a \"Fact Checker\" article, which explored at length the difference in meaning between the phrases \"act of terror\" and \"act of terrorism.\"[209] In the article, Kessler accused Obama of \"revisionist history\" for stating he had called the attack an \"act of terrorism\" when in fact he had used the term \"act of terror\", observing that Obama had gone out of his way to avoid calling the incident an \"act of terrorism\" or blame the ambassador's death on terrorism.[209][219]\nOn July 30, 2013, Rep. Ed Royce (R, CA-39) introduced the Department of State Operations and Embassy Security Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2014 (H.R. 2848; 113th Congress).[220] Supporters argued,\n- This bill advances efforts to improve the physical infrastructure at posts overseas to comply with the highest standards of protection; to increase training for those responsible for guarding our compounds and personnel; to put in place procedures that respond appropriately to threats, reducing the chances of another attack like that suffered in Benghazi, Libya; to review the policies and procedures of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security; to authorize the use of best value contracting at high risk, high threat posts; to authorize security improvements at soft targets; and to provide for security enhancements in line with Accountability Review Board recommendations.[221]\nCritics including Republican Party members accused the Obama White House and State Department of overemphasizing or fabricating the role of Islamic anger over the anti-Islamic movie Innocence of Muslims and alleged that the administration was reluctant to label the attack as \"terrorist\".[222] Representative Mike Rogers (R-MI), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who on September 13 said that the attacks had all the hallmarks of a coordinated attack by al-Qaeda,[223] has questioned whether there were any protests at all in Benghazi, saying: \"I have seen no information that shows that there was a protest going on as you have seen around any other embassy at the time. It was clearly designed to be an attack.\"[224] According to critics, the consulate site should have been secured better both before and after the attack. GOP legislators also took issue with delays in the investigation, which CNN attributed to \"bureaucratic infighting\" between the FBI, Justice, and State. On September 26, Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Georgia) said he \"cannot believe that the FBI is not on the ground yet\".[222]\nTestimony from top U.S. commanders after the attack revealed that the military was unprepared for conflict across Africa and the Middle East. No attack aircraft had been placed on high alert on September 11, the anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2001, and the closest fighter planes to trouble spots in North Africa were based in Aviano, Italy. The fighter planes based in Aviano were unarmed and no aerial refueling planes were within a 10-hour flight to the base. In addition, no AC-130 gunships were within a 10-hour flight of Libya, and their crews did not reach a staging base in Italy until 19 hours after the attack began.[225]\nWith the attack and subsequent criticism occurring in the last two months of the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Democrats and liberal media figures accused Republicans of politicizing the attacks in an unprecedented manner.[226][227] Romney was accused by the Obama campaign of trying to exploit the attacks for political gain, leading the father of Ambassador Stevens to call for both campaigns to avoid making it a campaign issue.[228]\nRobert Gates, former CIA director and Defense Secretary under Republican Presidents and then President Obama, said that some critics of the government's response have a \"cartoonish\" view of military capabilities. He stated that he would have responded with equal caution given the risks and the lack of intelligence on the ground, and that American forces require planning and preparation, which the circumstances did not allow for.[229]\nPresident Obama called the criticism a \"sideshow\"[230] and later accused Congress of \"taking its eye off the ball\" on the subject of the economy and focusing on \"phony scandals\". White House Spokesman Jay Carney later specified that the criticism of the administration's handling of the Benghazi attacks was one of those \"phony scandals\".[231]\nOn December 10, 2014, upon publication of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report on Benghazi,[232] Committee Chairman Mike Rogers wrote in an op-ed piece, \"The Obama administration's White House and State Department actions before, during, and after the Benghazi terrorist attack on September 11, 2012, ranged from incompetence to deplorable political manipulation in the midst of an election season.\"[233] However, immediately upon release of the committee's report on November 21, 2014, the Associated Press reported that the Committee did not conclude that any \"government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.\"[5]\nFor actions in Benghazi during the attack, Marine Gunnery Sergeant Tate Jolly was awarded the Navy Cross, and Army Master Sergeant David R. Halbruner was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.[234]\nIn January 2020 Mustafa al-Imam, a Libyan man accused of scouting for the Benghazi attackers, was sentenced to over 19 years in prison by a federal Washington judge.[235]\nU.S. media response\n[edit]The Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University described the conclusions of an unpublished study on November 2, 2012. Based on a textual analysis that tallied the occurrence of certain words and phrases in news reports during the days immediately following the attack, the study concluded that leading newspapers in the U.S. framed the attack in terms of a spontaneous protest over the anti-Islamic film Innocence of Muslims as framed by the Obama administration's version, four times as often as a planned terrorist attack, which was the Republican version.[236] However, the 2014 final report by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee found that during the days immediately following the attack there was confusion among intelligence analysts as to the origin of the attack, leading to an initial assessment that it was the spontaneous outcome from a protest. Obama administration officials, most notably Susan Rice, were provided this early assessment and repeated it to media outlets, only to be later contradicted as further intelligence assessments were made.[5][89] None of the ten investigations into Benghazi found that any senior Obama administration officials had acted improperly.\nOn September 13, Rachel Maddow, during her show on MSNBC, stated:\nAn organized attack. Anybody who tells you that what happened to our ambassador and our consulate in Libya was as a result of a protest over an offensive movie, you should ask them why they think that. That's the first version of events we heard. That does not seem to explain what happened that night or by the facts or the more facts we get.[237]\nOn the edition of October 24 of Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier, syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer claimed that a State Department e-mail, which passed along a report from Embassy Tripoli that Ansar al-Sharia had claimed responsibility for the attack on Facebook and Twitter,[238][239] proved that the White House knew of terrorist connections to the attack almost immediately. However, the day after the Benghazi attack, Ansar al-Sharia issued a statement saying that the attack was in part \"a spontaneous popular uprising in response to what happened by the West,\" which was an apparent reference to the Innocence of Muslims video.[240]\nConservative pundit Jonah Goldberg of the National Review stated that on NBC's Meet the Press, host David Gregory changed the subject when a guest raised the subject of the Benghazi attack, saying, \"Let's get to Libya a little bit later\", but never returned to the subject.[241][242]\nOn November 26, 2012, journalist Tom Ricks went on Fox News' Happening Now with Jon Scott to discuss the attack. While being interviewed on Fox News by Jon Scott, Ricks accused Fox News of being \"extremely political\" in its coverage of the attack and said that \"Fox was operating as a wing of the Republican Party.\" Ricks accused the network of covering the story more than it needed to be. The interview was cut short and Ricks and the interview was not mentioned or covered by Fox News again. Fox News was subsequently criticized for cutting the interview short.[243][244] In an interview with the Associated Press, Fox News' White House correspondent Ed Henry suggested that he thought Benghazi was being covered too much by the network. Henry said, \"We've had the proper emphasis, but I would not be so deluded to say that some of our shows, some of our commentators, have covered it more than it needed to be covered.\"[245][246]\nInvestigations\n[edit]There were ten investigations into the Benghazi matter: one by the FBI; one by an independent board commissioned by the State Department; two by Democrat-controlled Senate Committees; and six by Republican-controlled House Committees. After the first five Republican investigations found no evidence of wrongdoing by senior Obama administration officials, Republicans in 2014 opened a sixth investigation, the House Select Committee on Benghazi, chaired by Trey Gowdy. This investigation also failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing by senior Obama administration officials. A possible political motive for the investigation was revealed on September 29, 2015, when Republican House majority leader Kevin McCarthy, then vying to become Speaker of the House, told Sean Hannity on Fox News that the investigation was part of a \"strategy to fight and win,' adding \"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.\"[247][248]\nShortly after the Benghazi attack, Secretary of State Clinton commissioned an independent Accountability Review Board to investigate, chaired by retired ambassador Thomas R. Pickering with vice-chair retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen. The Board released their final report on December 19, 2012.[249] It made 29 recommendations to the State Department on how to improve its operations, which Clinton pledged to implement.[250] As part of this investigation, four career State Department officials were criticized for denying requests for additional security at the facility prior to the attack. By the end of 2012, Eric J. Boswell, the Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security, resigned under pressure, while three others were suspended.[21] None of the other Benghazi investigations identified wrongdoing by any individuals.\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi's final report was released on June 28, 2016, and the committee closed down five months later.[251] It criticized the actions and speed of response of the State Department, and the Defense Department, leading up to and during the attacks in Benghazi.[252] No further public investigations have been conducted since.\nThe findings of the two-year investigation by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee, the fifth of six Republican investigations, was summarized by the Associated Press on November 21, 2014:[5]\nA two-year investigation by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee has found that the CIA and the military acted properly in responding to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and asserted no wrongdoing by Obama administration appointees.\nDebunking a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies, the investigation of the politically charged incident determined that there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no missed opportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attack, intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found. That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest. But it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.\n...\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration and its then-secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who ran for president in 2016. People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to \"stand down\" after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaida figures in the attack, and that Stevens and the CIA were involved in a secret operation to spirit weapons out of Libya and into the hands of Syrian rebels. None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.\nThe report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack. Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in Washington.\nFOIA requests\n[edit]Freedom of Information Act requests have been made since the attack. The conservative foundation Judicial Watch filed a FOIA request to the Department of State on December 19, 2012. An acknowledgement of the request was received by Judicial Watch on January 4, 2013. When the State Department failed to respond to the request by February 4, 2013, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit, which resulted in seven photographs being delivered on June 6, 2013.[253] Three of the photographs show Arabic-language spray paint graffiti.\nOn May 30, 2013, it was reported that the Republican National Committee filed a FOIA for \"any and all emails or other documents containing the terms 'Libya' and/or 'Benghazi' dated between September 11, 2012 and November 7, 2012 directed from or to U.S. Department of State employees originating from, or addressed to, persons whose email addresses end in either 'barackobama.com' or 'dnc.org'\".[254]\nOn April 18, 2014, the conservative group Judicial Watch released more than 100 pages of documents obtained through a FOIA lawsuit.[255] One email, dated September 14, 2012, with a subject line \"RE PREP CALL with Susan: Saturday at 4:00 pm ET\", was from deputy national security advisor for strategic communications Rhodes stated:[256] \"Goals: ... To underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy...\"[257] According to another e-mail obtained by Judicial Watch, when asked about whether the attack was linked to the Mohammad video, State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said she \"could not confirm a connect as we simply don't know—and we won't know until there is an investigation\".[258]\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the e-mail was written to prepare U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice for her appearances on Sunday news shows two days later, and it \"sets out the Administration's view of the cause of the Benghazi attacks\".[259] John Dickerson of Slate says the e-mail refers to the worldwide protests against Innocence of Muslims and not the Benghazi attack.[260][verification needed]\nSee also\n[edit]- Attacks on the United States\n- Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad\n- Ambassadors of the United States killed in office\n- International response to Innocence of Muslims protests\n- 13 Hours – 2014 book about the attack\n- 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi – 2016 film about the attack based on the book\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Review of the Terrorist Attacks on U.S. Diplomatic Facilities in Benghazi, Libya, September 11–12, 2012 (PDF) (Report).

The intruders banged on the fortified safety gate of the bunker-like villa.\nA security officer handed his cell phone to Ambassador Chris Stevens. Prepare for the mob to blast open the locks of the safety gate, the officer said.\nSecurity blog: Benghazi review critical of State’s diplomatic security\nIt was a little before 10 at night on September 11, 2012. And time was running out for Stevens.\nVivid new details of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, were released Tuesday night by a federal committee trying to come to grips with the violence that led to the first murder of a U.S. ambassador since 1988 and the deaths of three other Americans.\nThe report spoke of grossly inadequate security, an issue that Stevens had complained about well before September 11.\nState Department resignations follow Benghazi report\nThe brief phone call\nInstead of blasting their way into the villa, the crowd retreated for some reason. But the fire still blazed.\nStevens used the cell phone to try to alert others about the attack.\nStruggling to see, choked by smoke, he dialed.\nRead more: Benghazi problems suggest long list of changes\nHe may have wanted to tell embassy officials in Tripoli that he and the small security detail at that 13-acre compound were in big trouble.\nThey were outmanned, outgunned. The militants had doused a large area with diesel fuel and started a hideous fire.\nHe may have wanted to say that he was trapped in a building they called Villa C with a security officer, and Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith.\nThey had to flee to the villa after intruders stormed the walled-in consulate compound armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.\nBut in that 9:50 p.m. phone call, Stevens could only tell the U.S. deputy chief of the mission in Tripoli that they were under attack.\nThe call promptly dropped.\nWarning signs\nThough fierce and sudden, the attack may not have been surprising for some.\nU.S. diplomats who worked in Libya, a country struggling to form a government after overthrowing longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, had repeatedly asked for more security.\nAmerican officials, for the most part, were well-received in Libya, where many locals were grateful for the help the United States provided in overthrowing Gadhafi.\nBut danger remained.\nRead more: State Department: Clinton not dodging Benghazi hearings\nThere were still many Gadhafi loyalists, there was easy access to guns and the new fledgling government was having a difficult time maintaining security.\nOn June 1, a car bomb exploded outside a hotel in Tripoli where Stevens was staying.\nRead more: Benghazi talking points omitted link to al Qaeda\nThe same month, Stevens had to move with his security team from the hotel because of a “credible’ threat.\nOn June 6, a roadside bomb exploded near the U.S. compound in Benghazi, hurting no one but blasting a large hole in a wall of the compound.\nThe threats continued for U.S. officials and diplomats from other countries – but security staffing remained unchanged.\nThe ambassador is missing\nBut now, there was no time to fret about woeful security.\nBlack smoke was filling up the safe area.\nStevens, Smith and the security officer crawled to a bathroom, hoping to open a window.\nThe security officer placed towels under the bathroom door and flung open the panes.\nIt made things worse.\nThe open window pulled more smoke into the bathroom, making breathing impossible.\nDespite the explosions outside, they would have to flee the safe area, the officer thought. The smoke had choked out the lights. They were in total darkness.\nThe officer left the bathroom, crawled through a hallway, banging on the floor and yelling that the ambassador and Smith follow him.\nHe slipped though another window and collapsed in an enclosed patio area.\nAnd then he noticed it.\nStevens and Smith were not there.\nThe officer slipped back through the window several times, even though the intruders were still shooting at him.\nThe smoke and heat was unbearable. He could not find either man.\nHe used a ladder to climb to the roof of the villa and radioed for help.\nHe had been in the smoky room for so long he could hardly speak. It took some time for the officers on the other end of the line to understand what he was saying.\nHe did not have Smith, he said. And the ambassador is missing.\nThe battle at the Annex\nThree other security officers had barricaded themselves in another building when the siege began.\nOnce the first wave of attackers seemed to retreat, the officers got out of their “defensive” positions and drove an armored car to the villa. They found their colleague on the roof, vomiting, about to pass out.\nThe three officers crawled through the smoke inside.\nRead more: Ex-CIA chief Petraeus testifies Benghazi attack was al Qaeda-linked terrorism\nThey found Smith. They dragged his body out. But they were too late.\nA team, from a nearby U.S. facility called the Annex, arrived and helped search for Stevens. They could not find him.\nConcerned that the large crowd of militants was about to overtake the entire compound, they decided to flee back to the Annex without Stevens.\nMen in the crowd began shooting, the bullets almost piercing the armored vehicle and blowing out two of its tires.\nThey drove on. At least two vehicles followed them.\nThey made it to the Annex, preparing for another fight. It was about 11:30 at night.\nJust before midnight, bullets began hitting the Annex. This started a gun battle that lasted for an hour.\nHours later, another wave of attacks hit the facility with mortars, killing security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.\nFinding Stevens\nHours passed and no one knew where Stevens was.\nAbout 2 a.m., the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli received a phone call.\nIt was from the cell phone of the security officer who had given his phone to Stevens.\nThe man on the line spoke Arabic, telling embassy officials that Stevens had been taken to a hospital in Benghazi.\nOfficials could not determine what hospital Stevens was taken to.\nSome wondered if the phone call was a trick from militants who wanted to lure U.S. officers to their death.\nA Libyan official was sent to Benghazi Medical Center. He said Stevens was there.\nHospital staff said six civilians brought Stevens to the emergency room about 1:15 a.m.\nEven though the ambassador showed no signs of life, doctors worked to revive him for 45 minutes.\nIt was too late.\nThis narrative account was pieced together from a report released Tuesday night by the Accountability Review Board, an independent panel selected by the State Department.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Related Content\nPress Release\nWASHINGTON -- Ahmed Abu Khatallah, aka Ahmed Mukatallah, 53, a Libyan national, was resentenced today to 28 years in prison on federal terrorism charges and other offenses stemming from the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack on the U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi, Libya. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. government personnel Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty died in the attack at the Mission and the nearby Annex in Benghazi.\nThe announcement was made by Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew G. Olsen, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew M. Graves, Assistant Director David J. Scott of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, and Assistant Director in Charge James E. Dennehy of the FBI’s New York Field Office.\nOn June 15, 2014, Khatallah was captured in Libya and brought to the United States to face trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\nOn Nov. 28, 2017, at his original sentencing, Khatallah was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison after a federal jury found him guilty of one count of conspiracy to provide material support or resources to terrorists, one count of providing material support or resources to terrorists, one count of maliciously destroying and injuring dwellings and property and placing lives in jeopardy within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and one count of using and carrying a semiautomatic assault rifle during a crime of violence.\nKhatallah appealed his conviction, and the government cross-appealed the sentence imposed. On July 26, 2022, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the conviction, but, having found that the defendant’s “sentence [was] substantively unreasonably low in light of the gravity of his crimes of terrorism” the court reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing.\nU.S. District Court Judge Christopher Cooper today resentenced Khatallah to 28 years.\nAccording to the government’s evidence, Khatallah was a leader of an extremist militia named Ubaydah bin Jarrah, which operated outside the law, and in the months prior to the attacks, he sought to incite violence by his and other militia groups against the presence of the United States in Libya. In early September 2012, he and other members of his group mobilized for an attack by stockpiling truckloads of weaponry.\nOn the night of Sept. 11, 2012, according to the government’s evidence, Khatallah directed his group to carry out the violence, striking first at the U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi. A group of men, armed with AK-47 rifles, grenades, and other weapons, swept into the Mission compound, setting fires and breaking into buildings. During that violence, Ambassador Stevens and Mr. Smith valiantly tried to protect themselves when the attackers stormed into a villa, but they were fatally overcome by thick, black smoke when the attackers set a fire. A State Department employee, who tried to guide them to safety, was injured.\nBefore, during and after the attack, Khatallah maintained contact with his group in a series of cellphone calls. Also, according to the government’s evidence, for much of the attack, he positioned himself on the perimeter of the compound and kept others, including emergency responders, from getting to the scene. The government’s evidence also showed that Khatallah made calls to leaders of other militia groups warning them not to interfere with the attack.\nFollowing the attack at the Mission, in the early hours of Sept. 12, 2012, the violence continued at a nearby CIA Annex, first with gunfire and then with a precision mortar attack. Mr. Woods and Mr. Doherty died in the mortar attack, and a State Department employee and U.S. government security specialist were seriously wounded.\nThis case was investigated by the FBI New York Field Office’s Joint Terrorism Task Force with substantial assistance from various other government agencies, including the two victim agencies, the CIA and the Department of State.\nThis latest proceeding in the case was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crabb, Jr., and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael C. DiLorenzo. Assistance also was provided by Trial Attorney Joseph Kaster of the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section and Victim/Witness Advocate Yvonne Bryant of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.\n14cr0141\n###\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

On the surface, Georgia has maintained a robust job market with a low overall unemployment rate of 3.3%. This low unemployment rate is partially attributed to a hiring pace that has stayed ahead of layoffs despite federal actions to slow the economy as part of efforts to fight rapid inflation. Beneath that surface, however, disaggregated data shows that an outsized share of Black, Brown and other Georgians with low incomes were harmed by inflation-fighting efforts. After reaching landmark employment levels in mid-2022, Black workers experienced 60% more unemployment spells than white workers. Since summer 2023, among workers in their prime working ages of 25 to 54, Black and Hispanic workers have experienced eroding employment levels, while white workers have continued to see an uptick in employment, surpassing their pre-pandemic peak. Furthermore, Georgia’s economic growth has not meaningfully lifted those earning low incomes, who saw some of the largest pay growth (21%) from 2019 to 2022 but whose buying power only rose by 4% over the same period due to inflation. To address these gaps, Georgia lawmakers must not only view the state’s job market through a racial equity lens but utilize this data as part of a worker-centered change of course to address the many barriers that continue to leave workers behind.\nIntroduction\nTo maximize economic security within Georgia’s job market, policymakers must also holistically measure and consider labor force trends when setting policy.[1] In turn, policy must actively work to reduce racial, ethnic and gender inequity to maximize workers’ contributions to the economy. A deeper dive beyond broad data trends reveals how lower-paid workers and workers of different racial and ethnic groups in Georgia either struggled in Georgia’s pandemic recovery, experienced short-lived boosts in employment or experienced blunted progress in pay increases due to consumer prices and limited leverage in the job market. The 2023 State of Working Georgia finds:\n- Georgians earning low wages saw 21% pay growth from 2019 to 2022, but their buying power only grew by 4% when accounting for inflation. This wage growth was primarily due to a record pace of workers transitioning into industries with higher-paying jobs.\n- Following a short period in mid-2022 when Black and Hispanic workers in Georgia experienced historic lows in joblessness, they began experiencing employment declines; their employment rates now remain far below last year’s landmark employment highs.\n- In the last 12 months since the Federal Reserve began slowing the economy to fight inflation, Black workers in Georgia have experienced nearly 60% more unemployment spells than white workers.\n- Approaching the end of the third quarter of 2023, among all Georgians in their prime working ages (25 to 54), Black Georgians have demonstrated the highest desire to work yet experience the lowest employment levels.\nWhile the Federal Reserve continues to thread the needle of slowing rapid growth in inflation while avoiding widespread job loss, Georgia’s Black workers are being disproportionately impacted by the Fed’s tactics. Still, state policy contributes to the most consistent racial and ethnic disparities in Georgia’s labor market, building on decades of racial discrimination and limited bargaining power for Black workers.[2] Furthermore, Georgia’s education-to-workforce pipeline, which includes a public workforce training system with job training outcomes that reproduce occupational segregation, excludes an inordinate share of Black workers from high-quality jobs.[3] Therefore, Black and Brown workers are overrepresented in Georgia’s unstable, low-wage jobs.[4] Long-term resilience and continued growth of Georgia’s economy rest on lawmakers boldly centering state policy around creating economic opportunity for all Georgia workers.\nGeorgians Saw New Possibilities for Job Mobility, but Barriers Remain\nApproaching the last quarter of 2023, Georgia’s growth in filled jobs, job openings and hiring has gradually cooled. Broadly, the state’s economy has remained strong as hiring has continued to outpace layoffs, with nearly four Georgia workers hired for every worker laid off as of August 2023. However, Georgia’s public sector job growth remains stagnant, with 10,000 fewer filled jobs in August 2023 compared to February 2020. This trend results from decades-long underinvestment in the state and local public workforce.\nJob demand in Georgia peaked by June 2022, with nearly three job openings for every unemployed worker. This phenomenon could be attributed to several factors, including temporary unemployment insurance expansions, economic impact payments and pandemic recovery programs offering historic policy investments that prevented a prolonged economic downturn.[5] These actions helped spur high levels of demand for labor, boosting job openings faster than Georgia workers could fill them. In turn, workers were more empowered to seek better jobs with increased leverage to drive Georgia businesses to raise wages.[6] Also, more employers changed hiring requirements to attract underpaid, young or previously inactive workers.[7]\nBy June 2022, the number of job quits reached a high of 245,000, marking a level of job transitions higher than in any other southern state. As Georgia workers changed industries for higher pay, these shifts significantly contributed to pay increases for workers throughout the state, with the most wage growth happening between 2021 and 2022. Those at the lowest rungs of the earning ladder, mainly Black and Hispanic workers, saw the highest pay growth.\nCompared to 2019, Georgians earning incomes at the midpoint of the pay scale saw their wages grow from the typical mid-level hourly pay of $18.19 in 2019 to $21.16 by 2022, an increase of more than 16%. [8] There is variation in the pay increases when categorized by race and ethnicity. The hourly pay for Hispanic Georgians earning at the midpoint of all Hispanic workers in Georgia was $17.77 an hour in 2022, a 25% increase from their earnings of $14.20 in 2019. Mid-level earnings among white workers rose nearly 19% during the same period, from $20.35 to $24.12. For Black workers earning mid-level income, hourly pay rose nearly 13%, from $17 an hour to $19.15.\nGeorgians at the lowest rungs of the earning ladder saw their pay grow from $9.92 in 2019 to $11.96, an increase of nearly 21%.[9] Most of their wage growth occurred from 2021 to 2022, when their wages climbed by almost 17%, more than double that of other low-wage workers across the country who only saw 7% growth over the same period. Broken down by race, typical wages among the lowest-earning Black workers grew from $9.11 to $11.10 from 2019 to 2022, a 24% increase, and rose from $10.05 to $12.10 among the lowest-earning white workers, a 20% rise.\nWhile a pandemic labor market gave more Black and Brown Georgians access to better jobs and pay, the absence of long-term, worker-centered state policy continues to limit their economic opportunity. Georgia has a law preventing any locality from setting a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage for any employer within its jurisdiction. Without livable pay standards that are indexed to match economic growth, recent increases in low-wage workers’ pay will continue to be eroded by inflation. While Georgians in the lowest earning brackets saw 21% pay growth over the last three years, rapid growth in consumer prices meant their buying power only grew by 4% over that period. Also, all employers did not raise pay to match the demands of the current job market, as workers have reported instances where employers lowered wages as part of lowering job eligibility requirements.[10] And broadly across all states, the largest slowdowns in wage growth in 2023 have occurred in job sectors that are typically lower paying, suggesting that a narrowing of wage inequality may be ending.[11] This could lead to added financial challenges for workers in Georgia, particularly those earning low incomes, as the cost of living continues to rise.[12]\nFor Black workers, national research suggests that mass incarceration could artificially increase their typical wage calculations, as it removes a disproportionate share of them from being accounted for in the low-wage workforce.[13] Two factors likely magnify this effect in Georgia. First, it has the highest incarceration rate of any democracy on earth. Second, Black Georgians make up an outsized 60% of Georgia’s prison population, nearly doubling their 31% share of the state’s population.[14]\nGeorgia also does not adequately invest in holistic work and career supports like child care subsidies, health coverage and need-based financial aid.[15] These policy choices limit job mobility for working-class Georgians, hindering their ability to navigate the multiple steps in a job transition. These steps include education and training, job searching and establishing new commuting patterns for a better job.[16]\nBroad Georgia Job Trends Mask the Erosion of Historic Labor Market Gains for Black and Brown Workers\nFollowing the mid-2022 peak of Georgia’s economic rebound, Black and Brown workers have experienced the most harm from Federal Reserve interest rate increases meant to tame inflation by raising borrowing costs. These actions have caused some businesses to slow their hiring pace, reduce hours or make firm changes that could increase the likelihood of employee attrition.[17] After reaching a 2.9% historic low in its overall unemployment rate in May 2022, Georgia climbed to 3.3% by August 2023, maintaining overall joblessness levels that remain better than any other point in its history. Such broad workforce measures mask the rapid erosion of economic security for Black and Hispanic workers in Georgia since mid-2022.\nAlthough Black workers in Georgia reached a historic low unemployment rate of 3.8% in mid-2022, by summer 2023, their unemployment rate had spiked to 5.9%. Additionally, the underemployment rate for Black workers, which is a more comprehensive measure of the underutilization of Black talent, increased to 12.3% by summer 2023 after reaching a historic low of 8.8% in mid-2022. On the other hand, white workers in Georgia have experienced much lower unemployment and underemployment. White workers experienced an unemployment rate reaching lows of 1.8% near late-2022 and hovering at only 2.2% by summer 2023. However, white underemployment increased from 4.8% to 7.4% over the same period, which is noteworthy growth despite remaining significantly lower than Black workers’ likelihood of underemployment. These differences reflect job market trends across roughly the same period, July 2022 to June 2023, which occurred soon after the Federal Reserve began efforts to slow the economy to tame inflation. During this period, Georgia’s Black workers experienced nearly 60% more unemployment spells than their white counterparts.[18]\nFollowing federal inflation-fighting policies, Georgia’s labor market began excluding Black workers from the job market faster than the national average, which may be due in large part to the state’s history of systemic racism.[19] By the latter half of 2022, disproportionate shares of Black Georgians were unable to secure employment. This trend is particularly noticeable when looking at employment trends among Black workers in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54. Prime-age Black workers’ employment peaked and declined much sooner in Georgia compared to the rest of the nation. Unlike white workers in Georgia, this group of Black workers never recovered to their 2019 employment levels, contributing to Georgia’s latest racial disparities in unemployment among all workers ages 16 and above.\nBlack Georgians are the most active job seekers but have the lowest employment levels among all Georgians. Among prime-age workers, Black workers have the highest labor force participation rate at 83.7%, but the lowest employment rate at 75.9%. Black workers now make up 60% of all Unemployment Insurance (UI) claim enrollment in Georgia, double their 31% share of the state’s total workforce. Since 2012, UI claim enrollment for Black workers have mostly outpaced white workers’ claims.\nLabor force participation and employment among prime-age Hispanic workers have declined since late 2022. This data suggests that Georgia’s cooling economy has not only begun to reduce their job prospects disproportionately but has caused more economic barriers that have prevented them from actively seeking employment. The employment rate for prime-age Hispanic workers peaked at nearly 85% in late 2022 but fell to 78% by the summer of 2023.\nUnderemployment among all Hispanic workers has also grown over the past several months. Following new lows in 2022, Hispanic underemployment sharply rose to 11.5% by the summer of 2023, suggesting more Hispanic workers either want to work but are discouraged about their job prospects or are forced to work part-time hours because full-time work isn’t available.\nAfter years of making up only 1% of unemployed Georgians who turn to UI protections, in 2022, Hispanic workers spiked to 6% of all UI enrollees in Georgia. However, by August 2023, they declined to only 2%. While this rapid cycle could be linked to several dynamics, Hispanic workers’ higher UI enrollment in 2022 could be associated with a heightened awareness of UI protections following unprecedented federal pandemic UI relief efforts. It could also be associated with historic employment highs among prime-age Hispanic workers in 2022, coupled with declines in self-employment during the same year among a Hispanic workforce that has broadly turned to self-employment more than all other Georgia workers from 2019 to 2022.[20] This suggests that as Hispanic workers moved toward more traditional forms of employment in 2022, they may have become eligible for UI benefits after being laid off.\nConclusion\nThe short-lived employment gains that Black, Hispanic and other low-wage workers reached by 2022 may have been halted by what has been expected as a temporary phase of Federal Reserve actions to slow down the economy. However, it is important to recognize that the long-term and historic racial inequities within the state’s workforce are partially the result of policy choices made by Georgia lawmakers. State policy reforms are necessary to address a multitude of barriers that continue to bar working-class Georgians from long-term economic opportunity. Lawmakers must:\n- Evaluate the Georgia economy based on a more comprehensive labor force lens that considers race, ethnicity and gender, rather than just overall unemployment rates. A strong and inclusive economy should not have a Black unemployment rate twice as high as other workers. It is crucial to ensure that the economy works well for everyone.\n- Increase Georgia’s minimum wage from $5.15 to a fair and equitable level and index it in proportion to economic growth. This will ensure Georgia workers do not lose buying power over time.\n- Remove barriers that minimize workers’ ability to bargain collectively.\n- Allow local governments to establish their own labor policies, including minimum wage and address unfair labor practices, such as wage theft and unethical scheduling practices.\n- Reform Georgia’s criminal legal system, which has the most people under carceral control per capita among all democracies worldwide.[21] This entanglement with the criminal legal system creates insurmountable barriers to employment, particularly for Black workers. Additionally, the imposition of unaffordable fines and fees further erodes the typically modest wages earned by justice-impacted individuals.[22]\n- Improve postsecondary education training options and affordability by investing in a comprehensive, racial equity-centered plan to track and address digital skills gaps and track workforce training program-level outcomes under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). Lawmakers should also invest part of the state’s budget in creating a comprehensive need-based financial aid program.[23]\n- Adequately fund unemployment insurance to support workers’ economic security if they lose a job through no fault of their own. Furthermore, the state should strengthen access to other work supports like child care and food assistance.\nWithout these worker-centered reforms, Georgia will continue to have inequitable economic recoveries, inequitable preparedness for future downturns and a stagnant workforce and economy that cannot grow and thrive.\nEndnotes\n[1] Khalfani, R.

Through a deliberative appropriations process, policymakers can allocate a historic level of resources to address the most critical needs facing Georgia families.\nThe massive amount of general fund reserves held by the state of Georgia—which exceeded $16 billion at the conclusion of Fiscal Year (FY) 2023—follows a recent trend, which is built on a related, dramatic increase in the size of repeated underestimations of annual state revenue collections. From FY 2021 through FY 2023, the equivalent of 15-22% of the funds appropriated by the General Assembly were left unspent at the end of each year, resulting in huge levels of “surplus” revenue. These funds allowed Georgia to fill the Revenue Shortfall Reserve (RSR) up to its cap of 15% of revenues ($5.4 billion) for the first time, covered the expenses of two years of modest income tax rebates and back-filled revenues that the state lost due to a 10-month suspension of the gas tax.\nGeorgia appears likely to repeat this trend in the current fiscal year. Overall, the Governor’s FY 2024 revenue estimate projects that year-over-year tax revenues will fall by about 13%, representing the worst performance on record since at least 1980. However, through the first quarter of FY 2024, year-over-year state revenues have increased by 6.1% ($463 million).\nBehind Georgia’s trend of multibillion-dollar surpluses is that, from FY 2019 to 2024, state spending has failed to keep pace with inflation and population growth. Between FY 2019 and FY 2024, spending has averaged an anemic annual increase of 3.5% per year—even as inflation averaged 4.2% per year and statewide population increased by an estimated 481,000 residents during the same period.\nAs state leaders consider how to best manage the $11 billion available in undesignated reserves, guiding principles should include prioritizing one-time investments that generate high levels of equitable return by front-loading future expenditures. There are several unique areas in which surplus funds present a rare opportunity to address deficits built up over time and projected needs for the future—all while strengthening Georgia’s economy, supporting job creation and benefiting families statewide.\nKey policy recommendations include:\n- Adjust Georgia’s revenue estimate to accurately reflect the amount the state may generate from taxes, fees and other sources in FY 2024, allowing the General Assembly to appropriate greater funding to address urgent, recurring needs.\n- Create a $7.5 billion, self-sustaining Child Care Trust Fund that promotes statewide access to affordable, quality child care and improves the lives of tens of thousands of families each year for generations to come.\n- Modernize Georgia’s statewide fleet of school buses. Making this long-deferred investment will free up other resources at the local level currently used to maintain and replace aging buses. Funding can also be used to address the worsening crisis of low pay that exacerbates the current bus driver shortage.\n- Provide bonuses for a healthier state workforce and to address persistently high turnover rates and overburdened agencies, prioritizing frontline workers.\nIntroduction\nWith $11 billion in undesignated reserves at the conclusion of Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 and Georgia’s Revenue Shortfall Reserve (RSR) maxed out at $5.4 billion, Georgia is poised to make historic and equitable investments in the future of its residents by expanding access to affordable child care, upgrading tens of thousands of school buses and addressing a host of urgent workforce needs. With its reserves, Georgia now has the necessary resources to support both major investments and ongoing needs in state government. Looking ahead, rather than maintaining unnecessary austerity measures, Georgia can implement significant improvements in budget practice by aligning the budget more closely with current revenue collections.\nThe state’s massive surplus is the direct result of successive and persistently low revenue estimates. For several years, these estimates have significantly underpredicted the revenue that the state would bring in, even in the face of contrary data. For example, the FY 2024 revenue estimate predicts a substantial decline in tax revenues, but there are strong economic indicators to the contrary, including 6.1% year-over-year growth in tax revenue reported for the first three months of FY 2024.\nThe huge level of general fund reserves held by the state is a recent trend, as is the magnitude of repeated underestimations of annual state revenue collections. From FY 2009 to 2019, the state of Georgia ended each fiscal year with an average of $270 million in surplus funds before achieving what was, at that time, a record RSR balance of $2.8 billion (11% of revenues) at the conclusion of 2019.[1] Then, between FY 2021 through FY 2023, the equivalent of 15-22% of the funds appropriated by the General Assembly were left unspent at the end of each year, resulting in huge levels of “surplus” revenue. So, for the past three years—the state of Georgia has raised approximately $15.5 billion more than it spent, adding to $2.7 billion in reserves that took nearly a decade to accumulate. These funds allowed Georgia to fill the Revenue Shortfall Reserve (RSR) up to its cap of 15% of revenues ($5.4 billion) for the first time, covered the expenses of two years of modest income tax rebates and back-filled revenues that were lost due to a 10-month suspension of the gas tax.[2]\nWith Overflowing Reserves, State Laws Do Not Account for ‘Undesignated Surplus’\nDespite the unprecedented amount of public funds that have accumulated beyond the RSR cap of 15%, Georgia lawmakers have not yet enacted new laws to govern the management and allocation of these dollars. Even though there is no clearly stated plan for this fund, the balance of Georgia’s undesignated reserves has continued to grow at a record pace.\nState leaders have only allocated a small portion of the available undesignated surplus funds despite the availability of these funds from the close of FY 2021 through FY 2024. State leaders’ focus, so far, has been on providing narrow, one-time income tax rebates and temporary suspensions of the gas tax. This has resulted in the state continuing to generate far more in new “surplus” funds than it allocates each year—a process by which recurring revenues become surplus funds. This phenomenon occurs largely due to leaders maintaining spending levels far below current capacity and holding on to most excess reserves.\nCurrently, the state of Georgia holds $11 billion in accumulated taxpayer funds, which are referred to as ‘undesignated surplus’ and governed under the statute originally established for the Revenue Shortfall Reserve (RSR). Under this statute, the governor has the authority to release funds from reserve accounts when the balance exceeds 4% of the amount raised during the preceding fiscal year. Georgia has reserves of approximately 45% of prior-year revenues, with 30% in undesignated surplus funds in addition to the equivalent of 15% of prior-year revenues in the RSR.\nUnder state law, surplus accounts are managed by the Office of the State Treasurer under policy guidance set by the State Depository Board, which the Governor chairs. The key factor in determining an appropriate investment strategy is when funds must be available for spending. With no clear plan for the $11 billion in undesignated surplus, these dollars should remain available for appropriation in the current fiscal year, limiting their potential utility to hold or grow their value in real dollars through investment.\nProlonged Austerity Affects Programs and Services as State Spending Remains Stagnant\nBehind Georgia’s trend of multibillion-dollar surpluses is that, from FY 2019 to 2024, state spending has failed to keep pace with inflation and population growth. Between FY 2019 and FY 2024, spending has averaged an anemic annual increase of 3.5% per year—even as inflation averaged 4.2% per year and statewide population increased by an estimated 481,000 residents during the same period.[3] To keep pace with the inflation-adjusted per-person spending of $3,072 in FY 2019, Georgia would need to spend approximately $33.8 billion, or 4.1% ($1.3 billion) more in the FY 2024 budget.[4] This figure does not include $242 million in appropriations that will go unallocated, at least through January, because of 134 non-binding budget disregards issued by Gov. Kemp upon signing the FY 2024 budget.[5] Including these disregards increases the budget gap to nearly $1.6 billion.\nIn recent years, unmet needs across state government have only grown. In Georgia’s FY 2020 budget, leaders eliminated over 1,000 vacant state jobs.[6] In response to the anticipated pandemic-induced economic recession, Georgia cut $2.2 billion, or 10%, from most agencies in FY 2021. The state never restored hundreds of millions in cuts—as Chancellor Sonny Perdue pointed out earlier this year in noting the persistently harmful effects of about $230 million in cuts made to the University System.[7] Overall, Georgia started FY 2022 with the state government employing nearly 6,400 fewer full-time employees than in 2018, down nearly 9.5%. The state also reached an all-time high full-time employee turnover rate of 29% in FY 2022.[8]\nThe state’s failure to fund unmet needs may be most evident in public schools, where Georgia has shifted a greater burden onto local governments to fund programs and services once covered by the state. In 2012, Georgia stopped covering the employer contribution to the State Health Benefit Plan (SHBP) for non-certified school employees, passing those costs on to local school districts. Then, as part of the FY 2023 budget, the state raised the annual contribution rate for SHBP by 67%, or $7,620 per employee—leaving districts to cover hundreds of millions in new costs. In addition, state funding for student transportation has remained stagnant over the years. In the 1990s, the state paid for about half of all transportation costs, but last year it only contributed about 20%. As a result, the financial burden of replacing school buses and paying driver salaries falls on the shoulders of local school districts.[9] Georgia is also one of six states not allocating additional funds to schools educating students in poverty, leaving rural and lower-income schools particularly vulnerable to increased costs.\nFederal Infusion Helped Georgia Avoid Major Recession and Boosted Revenue; Economic Trajectory Remains Strong\nIn 2020, unprecedented intervention from the federal government helped avert what could have been a deep, prolonged recession and a significant drop in tax collections. Instead, federal government intervention powered Georgia’s recovery and helped support state revenue. In addition to $4.8 billion in flexible State Fiscal Recovery Funds authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act—which continues to be deployed as allocated by Gov. Kemp—Georgia also benefited from $12.6 billion in other funding allocated under that landmark legislation. These funds came on top of $4.12 billion under the CARES Act’s Coronavirus Relief Fund and over $2 billion in other funding allocated to Georgia’s schools, higher education students, child care providers, transit and airports.[10] Furthermore, Georgia families were supported by three rounds of federal economic stimulus rebates of up to $3,200 per income tax filer and $2,500 per child, in addition to enhanced federal Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit payments that expired after 2021. Georgia businesses received $24.9 billion in Paycheck Protection Program funds intended to help pay workers, avoid layoffs and keep their doors open—much of which was fully forgiven by the federal government.[11]\nLooking ahead, Gov. Kemp’s tax revenue estimate for FY 2024 is equivalent to about $4.6 billion less than what the Department of Revenue collected in 2023—even though Georgia’s gas tax, which raises over $2 billion per year, was suspended for six months of the previous fiscal year. Overall, the Governor’s FY 2024 revenue estimate projects that year-over-year tax revenues will fall by about 13%, which would represent the worst performance on record since at least 1980.[12] However, revenue collections remain steady, up overall by about 6.1% ($463 million) through the first three months of the fiscal year.[13]\nGeorgia’s underlying drivers of major sources of revenue have continued to strengthen in recent years:\n- From 2019 to 2023, total statewide employment increased by a net of 295,400, or 6.4%, while median wages have grown by over 16% during the same period. Taxable net personal income increased by over 17% between 2019 and 2022, reaching an all-time high of $306 billion.[14]\n- Underpinning the massive surge of corporate income tax payments, corporate net taxable income reached nearly $31.6 billion in 2022, up two-fold from $15.8 billion in 2019.[15] The state raised $3.8 billion in corporate tax revenues in FY 2023, more than double Gov. Kemp’s estimated $1.9 billion.\n- Between 2019 and 2023, sales tax revenues grew by 44%, increasing from $6.2 billion to $8.9 billion, and Georgia recently enacted modernizations to capture revenue from online transactions and some digital downloads. Nationally, during this same period from July of 2019 to July of 2023, consumer spending increased by 28%.[16]\n- The state estimates that revenue from interest on deposits increased six-fold between FY 2019 and FY 2023, a difference of $804 million as its balance of cash on hand surged.\nThese numbers illustrate the various aspects of the state’s recovery that have contributed to revenue growth. It is important to note, however, that not all Georgians are thriving, and there may be economic challenges ahead. Nevertheless, the state is now better equipped than ever before to withstand a recession, with an unprecedented level of resources available in its RSR. The deployment of the $11 billion in undesignated reserves presents a historic opportunity to address long-deferred needs while laying a stronger foundation for sustained and equitable growth in the future.\nGeorgia Can Make Generational Investments by Responsibly Allocating Reserves\nAs state leaders consider how to best manage the $11 billion available in undesignated reserves, guiding principles could include prioritizing one-time investments that generate high levels of equitable return by front-loading future expenditures. There are several unique areas in which surplus funds could present a rare opportunity to address deficits built up over time and projected needs for the future—all while strengthening Georgia’s economy, supporting job creation and benefiting families statewide.\nCreate a $7.5 Billion Georgia Child Care Trust Fund\nThe affordability and availability of child care is becoming a bigger crisis every year. It results in billions of dollars lost from the national economy due to parents, especially mothers, not being able to fully participate in the workforce. Additionally, many children miss out on years of crucial quality early care and education. One of the highest-return policies the state could adopt is to establish a Child Care Trust Fund to ensure all Georgia families have access to affordable, quality options for child care, closing a glaring gap in the current system by dedicating substantial recurring funding to expanding early childhood education to ages 0-3.[17] There is mounting evidence that quality early care and education can positively impact children’s cognitive development and academic outcomes, highlighting a significant gap that needs to be addressed.[18]\nFor an amount that would still fall below the level of surplus funds raised during the last two years alone, Georgia could create a $7.5 billion, self-sustaining Child Care Trust Fund that promotes statewide access to affordable, quality child care and improves the lives of tens-of-thousands of families each year for generations to come. Under this proposal, the state would transfer an initial investment of $7.5 billion to establish the Child Care Trust Fund, which—if managed similarly to Georgia’s Teacher Retirement System (TRS) and Employee Retirement System (ERS)—could sustain annual payouts of between 5-10% per year to finance and expand access to high-quality, affordable child care options for families statewide.[19]\nWith an initial investment of $7.5 billion, the state could anticipate a first-year payout of about 6% of the Child Care Trust Fund (or $486 million). If the state meets the same 30-year return rate as TRS, Georgia could expect to generate about 7.9% annually. Under this proposal, the state could expect the balance of the fund to compound at a rate sufficient to help the Trust Fund’s annual rate of appropriations keep pace with projected inflation.[20] Allowing for an annual payout of 5-10% per year would also let the state appropriately manage the growth trajectory of the Trust Fund, while giving state leaders the flexibility to release a larger distribution if the Fund returns a higher rate of growth. This range of flexibility would give state leaders the necessary tools to balance demands for capital and programmatic investments for providers and subsidies for families.\nEstablishing a dedicated source of revenue to finance a permanent, recurring investment in child care would require amending Georgia’s Constitution, which must be approved by a two-thirds majority of lawmakers and a majority of voters.[21] Despite the significant level of support needed to implement this proposal, having a comprehensive and thoughtful decision-making process would give Georgians a voice in shaping the future of these public funds. It would also enable one-time allocated funds to continually enhance Georgia’s economy and the well-being of its residents throughout the state.\nExpanding early care and education through an amendment to Georgia’s Constitution would also allow the state to imagine an expansive vision for 0-to-3 child care that centers the individual needs of each family and community. Funding should support various providers, including formal center-based care, professional family child care providers, and family, friend and neighbor care. This structure will allow families to choose the most suitable setting for their child’s needs.\nThis proposal would improve and bolster, not supplant, Georgia’s current early care and education investments. For example, the state should preserve and enhance General Funds currently allocated (and matched by federal funds) to cover about 50,000 slots through the Childcare and Parent Services (CAPS) program for families with extremely low incomes. Additionally, leaders could think holistically and strategically about this proposal and how it can be combined with efforts to strengthen the state’s existing Pre-K program using dedicated funds from the Georgia Lottery. Under this new funding mechanism, Georgia can continue to build upon CAPS and the success of the Pre-K program while integrating other funding streams, such as the Child Care Development Block Grant and Head Start, to develop the strongest possible statewide system that is grounded in the specific needs and assets held by each community.[22]\nMaking access to early care and education truly universal across Georgia will take time and involve interconnected legislative and budgetary measures supported by local efforts to meet the unique needs of communities and families in every corner of the state. Creating a Child Care Trust Fund could be a first step to help power and sustain needed downstream investments through a permanent, recurring funding source. Georgia’s Child Care Trust Fund will allocate an estimated $5.2 billion in its first decade under the proposal outlined in this report. This funding could help support communities throughout the state to improve their infrastructure and capacity, resulting in more options for families seeking high-quality, affordable early childhood care and education.\nModernize Georgia’s Statewide Fleet of Public School Buses\nSchool districts in Georgia are facing higher transportation costs as the state has reduced funding for pupil transportation. In 1991, the state paid over half of the costs, but last year, it covered only 20% of the $1.1 billion in expenses. This shift has forced school districts to redirect money from other areas to cover transportation costs.[23] Rising fuel prices and the need for more drivers as enrollment grows also chip away at local budgets. Meanwhile, the state’s bus fleet has aged considerably in the absence of a broader schedule for bus replacement. At the beginning of the 2022 school year, Georgia had 6,300 buses in service for 15 years or longer. That represents about one out of every three buses on the road.[24] Approximately 12% of the statewide school bus fleet (about 2,400 buses) are out of service.\nUsing one-time undesignated reserve funds, Georgia should finance a complete modernization of its statewide fleet of 20,000 buses at a cost of between $850 million to $2.7 billion.[25] New buses reduce recurring costs for fuel by allowing districts to transition to diesel alternatives such as natural gas, propane or electric. Making this long-deferred investment will free up other resources at the local level currently used to maintain and replace aging buses. Funding can also be used to address the worsening crisis of low pay that exacerbates the current bus driver shortage. Class sizes, language accommodations, wraparound supports and other areas of need cannot get necessary funding if districts must use every available dollar to ensure that students arrive to school, as state law requires.\nWith sufficient resources available, the state should finance the upgrade of its school buses. By front-loading a one-time investment in modernizing these buses, Georgia can create an opportunity to improve education across the board. This will be particularly beneficial for rural districts with fewer students spread over large geographic areas.\nAddress High Turnover and Retain Key Staff; Provide Bonuses for a Healthier State Workforce\nCore agencies responsible for serving vulnerable Georgians, such as the Department of Human Services and Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities, continue to pay their staff low wages, which in many cases are significantly lower than the wages offered by the private sector. This is despite the fact that these agencies are facing annual turnover rates of 25% or more and experience significant staffing gaps.[26] While addressing these issues may require fundamental changes to recurring funding and staffing levels, there are ample resources available to immediately provide targeted bonuses to employees in critical areas.\nFor example, the state is currently dealing with unique and time-sensitive challenges. One such challenge includes rechecking eligibility for all 2.8 million Medicaid enrollees and the 1.5+ million families enrolled in both Medicaid and SNAP. On top of this, the state must also continue its regular operations for other programs. To ensure that eligibility workers at the Division of Family and Children Services receive fair compensation for their increased workload, the state should prioritize giving them bonuses.\nOne-time bonuses should be a supplement to higher wages, not a substitute. Cost-of-living adjustments are also necessary to prevent wage stagnation. Under this proposal, the state could offer critical employees a bonus of $5,000 in FY 2024. That bonus could shift into a permanent $2,000 increase in pay in 2025, with a $3,000 one-time bonus. The state could continue this pattern of phasing out bonus payments and phasing in higher salaries over the next several years to ensure sufficient resources are available to lift pay scales in the highest priority areas.\nIn FY 2023, the state allocated $405 million to give $5,000 cost of living adjustments to approximately 81,000 state employees. While it’s probable that most employees would need cost-of-living hikes to maintain salary competitiveness, the state can utilize its reserve funds to design suitable bonuses and gradually introduce related salary increases. This approach can lead to significant improvements in employee retention and recruitment.\nConclusion\nFor four consecutive years, Georgia’s budget has fallen short of the state’s capacity to meet the needs of its residents, as conditions across state government have worsened and vast needs continue to go unmet. Abundant untapped resources are now available—both in the form of recurring state revenues and undesignated reserves—that could be deployed to strengthen the economy, create and sustain jobs, and improve the quality of life for Georgians statewide. Georgia’s leaders must take full advantage of the substantial resources available to enact bold solutions that equitably invest in the future of our people. By expanding access to quality, affordable child care, ensuring all children can get to school safely and on-time, and prioritizing frontline workers that support the needs of countless residents, we can build a stronger future for all Georgians.\nEndnotes\n[1] Governor’s Budget Report, Fiscal Year 2024 and Amended Fiscal Year 2023.\n[2] Georgia State Accounting Office.

Medicaid is the primary program providing comprehensive health and long-term care to one in five people living in the U.S and accounts for nearly $1 out of every $5 spent on health care. Medicaid is administered by states within broad federal rules and jointly funded by states and the federal government, meaning restrictions in federal Medicaid spending could leave states with tough choices about how to offset reductions through cuts to Medicaid, cuts to other programs, or tax increases.\nThis analysis examines the potential impacts on states, Medicaid enrollees, and providers of implementing a per capita cap on federal Medicaid spending, which is one proposal that has been discussed in Congress. The analysis assumes, based on proposals floated in Congress, that the plan would cap federal Medicaid spending growth per enrollee for each of the five major eligibility groups at medical inflation. Given the likelihood of multiple, simultaneous changes to Medicaid and the interactive nature of those changes, the analysis also illustrates the effects of a per capita cap on Medicaid if implemented jointly with the elimination of the 90% federal match rate for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, another significant policy change that has been discussed in Congress and which was examined by a previous KFF analysis. Other proposals to reduce federal Medicaid spending have also been reportedly raised, including work requirements, a reduced federal matching rate, limits on provider taxes to finance the state share of Medicaid spending, and repeal of certain Medicaid regulations issued by the Biden administration. Future KFF analyses will examine these proposals as well.\nKey takeaways\n- The estimated effects of a per capita cap depend highly on what assumptions are made about policy specifications, future growth in Medicaid spending, and states’ responses to federal cuts.\n- Capping per enrollee spending could reduce federal spending by $532 billion to nearly $1 trillion dollars between FY 2025 and FY 2034. Depending on how states respond, the policy could shift costs to states by $532 billion and leave total Medicaid spending unchanged or total Medicaid spending could decline by 14% (or $1.4 trillion).\n- If per capita caps were implemented jointly with the elimination of the enhanced ACA expansion match rate, federal Medicaid spending could decline by $1 trillion to $2.1 trillion dollars between FY 2025 and FY 2034. Depending on how states respond, this combination of policies could shift costs to states by $1 trillion and leave total Medicaid spending unchanged or total Medicaid spending could decline by a quarter (or $2.6 trillion).\n- If states reduced Medicaid eligibility proportionally to the cuts in federal spending, 15 million enrollees could lose Medicaid coverage under a per capita cap by the final year of the analysis, with that figure doubling to 30 million when combined with elimination of the ACA expansion match rate.\n- States would face tough choices about Medicaid’s future under a per capita cap: maintaining current Medicaid benefit levels and enrollment would require states to pay $1,500 to $2,300 more per enrollee in the final year of the analysis.\n- The effects of a per capita cap differ across eligibility groups because spending for different eligibility groups is expected to grow at different rates, with larger estimated effects among children and adults who are not eligible because they have a disability or are ages 65 and older.\n- All states would be affected by a per capita cap, but the size of the effects vary due to differences in the mix of enrollees. Depending on state responses, state spending could increase up to 57% in some states if they chose to pay for the cuts. Enrollment could decrease by similar levels if states chose to restrict eligibility in response to the federal funding cuts.\nSpending reductions under a per capita cap would compound over time as expected increases in Medicaid spending diverge from the caps. The effects would be smaller immediately following implementation, larger in FY 2034, the final year of this analysis, and continue to grow in the years after 2034. A per capita cap can provide lower and more predictable federal costs over time, but it would also fundamentally change the Medicaid federal-state partnership by eliminating the federal guaranteed match and transferring new financial risk to states. States would face significant challenges in efforts to pay for federal cuts and there would be pressure to reduce benefits and eligibility, with even larger effects if a per capita cap were paired with other Medicaid cuts. Beyond reduced Medicaid spending and enrollment, there could be increases in the number of people who are uninsured, fewer covered benefits for future Medicaid enrollees, and reduced revenues available for health plans and providers such as hospitals and nursing facilities.\nWhat is the proposed policy change?\nMedicaid spending is currently shared by states and the federal government with a guarantee to states for federal matching payments without a cap on federal expenditures. The percentage of costs paid by the federal government (known as the federal medical assistance percentage or “FMAP”) for most Medicaid enrollees is determined by a formula set in law designed to provide a higher federal match rate for states with lower per capita incomes. There are also higher match rates for certain services and populations like the ACA expansion group (90%). This leads to variation in the federal share of Medicaid spending across states. There is also considerable variation in per enrollee spending across states, due to state flexibility to determine eligibility levels, benefits, and provider payment, and across eligibility groups,reflecting differences in health care needs and utilization.\nThis analysis estimates the impact of implementing a per capita cap on the federal share of Medicaid spending. One proposal under consideration would “establish a per capita cap [on federal Medicaid expenditures] for each of the different enrollment populations set to grow at medical inflation.” While specifics on the implementation of this policy would be included in a legislative proposal, further details have yet to be released, and assumptions made here may differ from details included in proposed legislation. To estimate a per capita (i.e., per enrollee) cap policy, this analysis first establishes FY 2025 per enrollee spending as the base year estimate; then, starting in FY 2027, the analysis limits federal spending growth for the five major eligibility groups (children, adults, expansion adults, people with disabilities and aged 65+) to the consumer price index (CPI-U) plus 0.4 percentage points, which is KFF’s estimate of the difference between CPI-U and medical inflation (CPI-M) over the past 20 years (see Methods).\nThe analysis also estimates the combined impact of implementing a per capita cap and eliminating the ACA expansion federal match rate. The combined policy would include the same per capita caps on federal spending and also assumes that, starting in FY 2027, expenditures for people eligible through Medicaid expansion would be matched at each state’s traditional FY 2026 FMAP rate. This part of the analysis accounts for the interactive effects of these two policy changes; therefore, savings are lower than if each policy was modeled separately and the totals were added together (see Methods). There are a number of other Medicaid policy changes that have been suggested, and policy estimates would likely differ depending on the combination of policies and their interactive effects.\nWhat is the potential impact on Medicaid spending?\nThis analysis does not make assumptions about specific state behavioral responses and instead examines how the impacts of the two policy alternatives vary based on two types of state responses to the cuts. The state responses are designed to illustrate the spectrum of potential policy change effects. However, in practice, each state is likely to respond to the policy change differently and spending impacts overall would likely fall within the range. While some states may choose to increase state spending to maintain current programs with substantially reduced federal funding, many would likely need to make programmatic cuts, making both the lower end and higher end estimates unlikely. The analysis does not explore people’s insurance coverage after losing Medicaid; some may enroll in another source of coverage, but many others would likely become uninsured. The estimates presented here are not directly comparable to the estimates of federal savings from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) because CBO’s estimates account for people enrolling in other coverage and make assumptions about how states would respond in the aggregate. While the estimates assume that spending per enrollee by eligibility group would grow uniformly across states based on CBO’s national projections, it is likely that growth rates would vary by state, and that a cap would therefore have varying effects\nPer Capita Cap\nIn analyzing the effects of a per capita cap on Medicaid spending, KFF considered the following two types of state responses.\n- Pay for Federal Cuts: States maintain per enrollee spending and eligibility at current levels, picking up new costs due to the federal cap on per enrollee spending. Enrollment and total spending would remain constant while costs would shift from the federal government to the states. States would have to make offsetting cuts in programs other than Medicaid or raise revenues.\n- Reduce Spending and Eligibility: States cap their share of per enrollee spending at medical inflation – e.g., by reducing payment rates to health care providers — and also reduce eligibility by the same percentage that federal spending is cut for each eligibility group to reflect the fact that the federal government is contributing less towards the cost. As a result, there would be decreases in enrollment and total, federal, and state spending.\nCapping per enrollee spending could shift costs to states or reduce total Medicaid spending by 14% ($1.4 trillion) over a 10-year period (Figure 1). If states offset the federal cuts, federal Medicaid spending could decrease by 8% or $532 billion over the 10-year period, and states would pay those costs, increasing the state share by 14% across all states. If instead, states cap their share of per enrollee spending and reduce Medicaid eligibility, federal Medicaid spending could decline by 15% or $989 billion, reflecting the fact that per enrollee spending is capped and enrollment goes down. State spending could decline by 12% or $450 billion. Combined, Medicaid spending could decrease by 14% or $1.4 trillion over the 10-year period. The analysis assumes states would reduce Medicaid eligibility proportionally to the cuts in federal spending, and the effects compound over time, meaning spending and enrollment effects are smaller in years just following implementation but grow over time. By the end of the 10-year period, enrollment could be 17% lower than current policy, meaning 15 million people could lose Medicaid coverage. Some who lose Medicaid may enroll in another source of coverage, but many others would become uninsured.\nPer Capita Cap and Elimination of the ACA Expansion Match Rate\nIn analyzing the effects of a per capita cap on Medicaid spending if it were combined with the elimination of the ACA expansion match rate, KFF considered the following two types of state responses.\n- Pay for Federal Cuts: States maintain per enrollee spending and eligibility at current levels, picking up new costs due to the federal cap on per enrollee spending and the loss of the higher match rate for expansion enrollees. Enrollment and total spending would remain constant while costs would shift from the federal government to the states.\n- Reduce Spending and Eligibility: States cap their share of per enrollee spending at medical inflation, drop the ACA Medicaid expansion, and reduce eligibility by the same percentage that federal spending per enrollee is cut for each eligibility group, resulting in changes to enrollment and to total, federal, and state spending as well as per enrollee spending.\nCapping per enrollee spending and eliminating the ACA expansion match rate could shift costs to states or reduce total Medicaid spending by a quarter ($2.6 trillion) over a 10-year period (Figure 2). If states pay for the cuts, federal Medicaid spending could decrease by 15% or $1 trillion over the 10-year period, and states would pay those costs, increasing the state share by 27% across all states. If instead, states cap their share of per enrollee spending and reduce Medicaid eligibility, federal Medicaid spending could decrease by 32% or $2.1 trillion, and state spending could decrease by 15% or $571 billion. Combined, Medicaid spending could decrease by 26% or $2.6 trillion over the 10-year period. Enrollment losses could increase each year proportionally with the increase in federal spending cuts, resulting in 30 million (or 36%) fewer people with Medicaid coverage by the end of the 10-year period.\nImpacts on State Spending if States Pay for Federal Cuts to Medicaid\nUnder both policy alternatives, costs would shift significantly from the federal government to the states if states chose to maintain current benefits and eligibility, causing state Medicaid spending per enrollee to increase by $1,500 to $2,300 in FY 2034 (Figure 3). With federal Medicaid spending per enrollee capped, state spending per enrollee could increase from $5,500 under current policy to $7,000 with a per capita cap and $7,800 if the per capita cap were paired with the elimination of the ACA expansion match rate. By FY 2034, the federal share of Medicaid spending on average across states could fall from 64% to 54% with a per capita cap and 49% if the per capita cap were paired with elimination of the ACA expansion match rate.\nAll states would be affected by a per capita cap, but the specific effects vary depending on the mix of enrollees in a state, with state spending increasing by as much as 57% in some states if paired with the elimination of the ACA expansion match rate (Figure 4). If states opted to pay for the federal Medicaid cuts, state spending on Medicaid could increase anywhere from 6% to 57% over 10 years. Expansion states could experience much larger state cost increases, ranging from 18% to 57% if the per capita cap were paired with the elimination of the ACA expansion match rate, whereas state cost increases for all non-expansion states could remain at or below 21%. While this analysis assumes that growth rates for each eligibility group are uniform across states under current policy, it’s likely that growth rates would vary by state in any given period based on policy choices and underlying factors related to their economies and health systems.\nImpacts on Medicaid Spending and Enrollment if States Respond to Federal by Cutting Spending and Eligibility\nThe effects of per capita caps differ across eligibility groups because spending for different eligibility groups grows at different rates, with larger effects among children and adults who are not eligible because they have a disability or are ages 65 and older. The effects vary by eligibility group because spending estimates under current policy assume that per enrollee spending for each group grows at different rates (aligning with CBO per enrollee spending growth assumptions), but the per capita cap policy would limit the growth for all groups using the same inflation rate. Spending grows at different rates largely based on the percentage of spending that comes from use of long-term care for each eligibility group. Although Medicaid enrollees who use long-term care have much higher per enrollee costs, CBO expects those costs to grow more slowly in future years. By FY 2034, the decline in per enrollee spending under a per capita cap could be: 24% for expansion adults, 20% for other adults, 19% for children, 11% for people eligible because of a disability, and 6% for adults ages 65 and older.\nThis analysis assumes that states would reduce eligibility in proportion with the cuts to federal spending, resulting in larger total spending and eligibility cuts among children and adults who are not eligible because they have a disability or are ages 65 and older (Figure 5). Under a per capita cap, total spending would drop to reflect the lower per person costs and the reductions in eligibility, which would be proportional to the cuts in federal spending. In FY 2034, an estimated 15 million fewer people could be covered by Medicaid including:\n- 5.3 million children,\n- 4.8 million adults eligible through the ACA expansion,\n- 2.9 million parents and other adults under age 65,\n- 1.3 million people with disabilities, and\n- 0.6 million people ages 65 and older.\nAn additional 15 million expansion enrollees could lose Medicaid coverage (totaling about 20 million expansion enrollees by FY 2034) if the ACA expansion match rate is also eliminated. Some people losing Medicaid would be eligible for ACA marketplace coverage (those with incomes 100-138% of the poverty level) and others would be able to obtain employer-sponsored health insurance. But, others would become uninsured. Most people over age 65 and some who qualify for Medicaid based on a disability would generally be able to maintain Medicare coverage but could lose access to wrap-around services not covered by Medicare.\nAll states would be affected by a per capita cap, but the specific effects vary, with enrollment decreasing by as much as 57% in some states if paired with the elimination of the ACA expansion match rate in 2034 (Figure 6). If states respond to federal cuts by reducing eligibility, Medicaid enrollment could decrease anywhere from 12% to 57% in 2034. Expansion states could experience much larger enrollment declines if paired with the elimination of the ACA expansion match rate, ranging from 31% to 57%, whereas enrollment declines for all non-expansion states could remain at or below 17%.\nWhat are other implications to consider?\nMedicaid per capita caps lock in historical spending patterns, and the effects would compound overtime so the full implications would not be visible until after FY 2034. Per capita caps are initially set to reflect historical spending patterns that vary by state and eligibility group. Spending per enrollee will grow at the same rate for all states and eligibility groups, meaning that the low-spending states today will continue to be low-spending states indefinitely, and the same is true for spending across the eligibility groups. Moreover, the caps are typically designed to constrain federal Medicaid spending growth to a rate slower than is expected under current law, which is how they achieve federal savings. As time passes, the effects compound, limiting states’ ability to meet changing needs and demands. Federal spending reductions in FY 2034, the final year of the analysis, are larger than reductions over the full 10-year period (Figure 7), and the effects on enrollment and spending in future years would continue to grow.\nThe effects of a per capita cap on Medicaid spending and enrollment are also highly sensitive to policy design, inflation rates, and how states respond to the cuts; and estimates are highly sensitive to assumptions about those factors. Decisions about how to calculate the per enrollee allotments for the base year and how to grow the allotments over time would determine the magnitude of costs shifted to states. The effects also depend on how much Medicaid costs grow over time and how they compare with changes in the inflator used to calculate the caps. States’ responses to the cuts would determine how much total spending and enrollment changed. If per capita caps are paired with other cuts to Medicaid, effects would be larger, and there would be more pressure on states to respond with programmatic cuts. Estimates of the effects of different per capita cap proposals may find a wide range of outcomes depending on what assumptions are made to complete the analysis.\nA per capita cap would fundamentally change the Medicaid federal-state partnership by eliminating the federal guaranteed match and transferring new financial risk to states. Per capita caps allow federal spending to rise with enrollment; however, spending would not rise to account for: increasing costs due to the emergence of new technology such as cell and gene therapies, changes in population health status that increase per enrollee spending, or increased provider payment rates enacted to address workforce shortages. Medicaid is currently a partnership between the federal and state governments with both entities sharing the financial risk. Under a per capita cap scenario, federal spending would be lower and more predictable. The federal government would only bear risk associated with enrollment changes and the states would assume 100% of the risks associated with other factors that affect health care spending.\nUnder any per capita cap policy, states would face challenges and there would be pressure to reduce benefits and eligibility, but the effects would be larger if a per capita cap were paired with other Medicaid cuts. To maintain current policy, states would have to increase state tax revenues or decrease spending on non-Medicaid services such as education, which is the largest source of expenditures from state funds. Given the size of the federal funding cuts, states would face significant challenges in efforts to replace the loss of federal funds, which would be exacerbated if paired with other reductions in federal funding for areas beyond Medicaid. The loss of federal revenues would create significant pressure to eliminate the Medicaid expansion and restrain the growth in per enrollee spending for other enrollees. Medicaid spending per enrollee already grows at a slower rate compared with private insurance and Medicare, leaving fewer options for cutting per enrollee costs. States would all respond differently but could reduce spending by cutting optional benefits (which includes prescription drugs and nearly all home care, also known as home and community-based services or HCBS), reducing provider payment rates, or cutting eligibility for the specific eligibility groups with higher per person spending, such as those linked to the use of long-term care.\nIf states are unable to maintain Medicaid eligibility, benefits, and payment rates, there could be increases in the number of people who are uninsured, reduced access to care, and significant reductions in payment rates to providers. Reduced Medicaid eligibility would mean an increase in the number of uninsured people, with the most notable increases likely among people eligible for coverage through the ACA expansion, though people with disabilities may be particularly vulnerable on account of their more extensive health needs. Enrollees with incomes between 100% and 138% of poverty could be eligible for coverage through the ACA marketplaces, but ACA coverage could soon become more costly for enrollees if the enhanced subsidies expire at the end of 2025, and few low-income people have access to insurance through their employer. An increase in the number of uninsured people could reverse gains in financial security, access to care, and health outcomes as well as lead to loss of revenues and increased uncompensated care costs for providers. Providers could also face revenue losses from lower Medicaid payment rates or coverage of fewer services, which could exacerbate issues with access to care for Medicaid enrollees and within the health care system more broadly.\nAppendix\nMethods\nData: To project Medicaid enrollment, spending, and spending per enrollee by state and eligibility group, this analysis uses the Medicaid CMS-64 new adult group expenditure data collected through MBES for FY 2023 (downloaded in December 2024), Medicaid new adult group enrollment data collected through MBES for June 2024 (downloaded in December 2024), the 2019-2021 T-MSIS Research Identifiable Demographic-Eligibility and Claims Files, and the June 2024 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline.\nOverview of Approach:\n- Develop baseline projections of Medicaid enrollment, spending, and spending per enrollee by state and eligibility group from FY 2025 through FY 2034 (a 10-year period). This model estimates Medicaid enrollment and spending under the status quo with no policy changes.\n- Estimate Medicaid enrollment, spending, and spending per enrollee by state and eligibility group over the same 10-year period after accounting for the effects of proposed policy changes.\n- Calculate differences in Medicaid enrollment, spending (including federal, state, and total spending), and spending per enrollee in the policy change scenario relative to the baseline projections.\n- The estimates do not predict states’ responses to federal policy changes, but we examine differences in Medicaid enrollment, spending, and spending per enrollee under different scenarios to reflect the range of outcomes depending on state responses.\nDefinitions and Limitations:\n- At the time of publishing, CBO had released their January 2025 baseline. However, this analysis uses CBO’s June 2024 baseline because it was the most recent baseline with spending projections by Medicaid eligibility group.\n- The estimates assume that all states experience the same growth rates for Medicaid enrollment and spending; and that total spending grows at the same rate as federal spending.\n- FMAP calculations do not account for the other services that are matched at a higher rate, which include family planning, services received through an Indian Health Services facility, expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the “Qualifying Individuals” program, and health home services that are matched at a 90% rate. For this reason, the model may underestimate the federal share of spending in some states.\n- Estimates of total spending include all spending that is matched as medical assistance but exclude states’ administrative costs which are matched at a separate rate. Federal payments for administrative costs are less than 4% of total federal spending, according to the CBO June 2024 baseline.\n- The analysis does not account for secondary effects or people’s behavioral responses.\n- The analysis does not include policy effects for states that had not expanded Medicaid under the ACA as of February 2025 but would have done so in the absence of the policy change.\n- We implement the elimination of the expansion FMAP in FY 2026 and the per capita cap in FY 2027; we assume they take effect immediately.\n- To implement a per capita cap, this analysis uses CPI-U + 0.4% instead of CPI-M because projections of CPI-M are not available. Studies and data show that in any given year, either measure may be higher so it’s unclear whether savings would be larger or smaller using a different measure. We chose to add 0.4% to CPI-U because over the past 20 years, CPI-M was 0.4% higher than CPI-U.\nWe provide more details about the baseline model below.\n1. Estimate initial Medicaid spending and enrollment by eligibility group using the most recent years’ data available (FY 2023 for spending data and FY 2024 for enrollment data).\n- First, we pull the quarterly Medicaid CMS-64 new adult group expenditure data collected through MBES for FY 2023 and aggregate total spending by state for enrollees in the ACA expansion group and for all other Medicaid enrollees. Spending reflects an accrual basis of accounting.\n- We exclude spending on DSH by calculating the share of spending on DSH from the FY 2023 CMS-64 Financial Management Report and reducing medical assistance among non-expansion enrollees by that share.\n- Separately, we pull the Medicaid new adult group enrollment data collected through MBES for June 2024. This data includes enrollment by state and is broken into ACA expansion group enrollees and all other Medicaid enrollees. MBES enrollment includes individuals enrolled in limited benefit plans and only includes individuals whose coverage is funded through Medicaid (not CHIP).\n- To obtain spending and enrollment estimates across the remaining eligibility groups (seniors, individuals with disabilities, children, and other adults), we apply the distribution of spending and enrollment across the groups and by state from T-MSIS to the FY 2023 spending data and June 2024 enrollment data. We use the average distribution from 2019 to 2021 to mitigate the impact of the continuous enrollment provision (data in states denoted as “unusable” for a given year by the DQ atlas were excluded from the averages).\n2. Calculate initial spending per enrollee in FY 2024.\n- We grow Medicaid spending in FY 2023 by CBO’s growth rates for federal benefit payments by eligibility group to get Medicaid spending in FY 2024. The June 2024 enrollment data is used as our FY 2024 enrollment.\n- We divide Medicaid spending in FY 2024 by Medicaid enrollment in FY 2024 (for each state and eligibility group) to get Medicaid spending per enrollee in FY 2024.\n3. Project total spending and spending per enrollee for fiscal years 2025 through 2034 using CBO growth rates and use those estimates to calculate future years’ enrollment.\n- Starting with spending data for FY 2024, we apply the CBO growth rates to estimate Medicaid spending in FY 2025 through FY 2034.\n- Starting with per enrollee spending in FY 2024, we apply the CBO growth rates for average federal spending on benefit payments per enrollee to estimate Medicaid spending in FY 2025 through FY 2034.\n- We calculate enrollment growth in FY 2025 through FY 2034 by dividing estimated Medicaid spending by estimated spending per enrollee.\n4. Split total Medicaid spending over the 10-year period into federal and state spending.\n- We calculate federal and state spending by using a 90% match rate for the ACA expansion group and the traditional state FMAPs for the remaining eligibility groups. We use the FY 2025 FMAPs for FY 2025 and FY 2026 FMAPs for FY 2026 and beyond.\nWe provide more details about the policy change scenarios below.\n1. Calculate spending and spending per enrollee under a per capita cap if states pay for federal cuts to maintain spending and eligibility by state.\n- Assume expansion enrollment and total spending remain the same as the baseline model over the 10-year period.\n- Establish the base year of per capita spending as the lessor of FY 2025 or FY 2027. We chose FY 2025 because most per capita cap proposals use spending from the period prior to enactment of the law to prevent states from inflating their base estimates of per capita spending in response to the law. We assume the per capita cap takes effect in FY 2027, so FY 2025 and FY 2026 per enrollee spending are the same as baseline and FY 2027 per enrollee spending is the same as the base year. We also assume that if states’ per enrollee spending for an eligibility group dropped between FY 2025 and FY 2027, the per capita cap would start at the lower baseline level to avoid giving states a higher match rate than they would have received under current policy.\n- After FY 2027, growth in per enrollee spending is capped at estimated medical inflation levels. To estimate medical inflation, we use CPI-U (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers) + 0.4%, which is the difference in CPI-U and CPI-M (CPI Medical Care) over the past two decades.\n- Calculate new federal spending levels based on the capped per enrollee amounts by first multiplying enrollment and new per enrollee levels and then calculating the federal share using the FMAP.\n- For the combined per capita cap and elimination of the ACA expansion match rate, we assume the elimination of the expansion FMAP takes effect in FY 2027, so FY 2025 and FY 2026 federal and state spending are the same as baseline. Starting in FY 2027, we apply the 2026 traditional state FMAPs to the expansion group spending instead of the 90% rate to split total spending into the federal share.\n- State spending is calculated as the difference between baseline total spending (held constant) and new reduced federal spending levels.\n2. Calculate spending and enrollment if states respond to federal cuts by reducing spending and eligibility by state.\n- Per enrollee spending is capped and grown at CPI-U + 0.4% starting in FY 2027 (same as above).\n- Enrollment for each eligibility group is reduced by the same percentage that federal spending has been cut each year. This increases each year, but reaches 24% for expansion adults, 20% for other adults, 19% for children, 11% for people eligible because of a disability, and 6% for adults ages 65 and older by FY 2034. The total federal spending reduction and resulting total enrollment reduction are not equivalent due to differences in the distribution of spending and enrollment across groups.\n- For the combined per capita cap and elimination of the ACA expansion match rate, starting in FY 2027, expansion enrollment is reduced to zero, leading to zero total spending for expansion enrollees for FY 2027 – FY 2034.\n- Calculate total spending for other eligibility groups by multiplying new enrollment by capped per enrollee levels.\n- Split total Medicaid spending for other eligibility groups into federal and state spending using traditional state FMAPs.\n3. Calculate differences in Medicaid enrollment, spending (including federal, state, and total spending), and spending per enrollee relative to the baseline projections.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Reductions could help offset the costs of extending expiring tax cuts. A draft bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in February 2025 includes a minimum work requirement for certain adults enrolled in Medicaid as a condition of coverage. The idea of promoting “work” is popular, particularly among Republicans who view Medicaid as a form of welfare. As debate heats up about Medicaid work requirements, data show most Medicaid adults are working or face barriers to work. Many Medicaid adults who are working low-wage jobs are employed by small firms and in industries that have low employer-sponsored insurance offer rates.\nIf Congress does not include work requirements in federal legislation, some states will pursue Medicaid work requirements through Medicaid demonstration waivers. The first Trump administration encouraged and approved “Section 1115” demonstration waivers that conditioned Medicaid coverage on meeting work and reporting requirements, approving 13 state work requirement waivers. Only Arkansas implemented such requirements with consequences for noncompliance, which resulted in over 18,000 people losing coverage. These approvals were either rescinded by the Biden administration or withdrawn by states, and Georgia is the only state with a Medicaid work requirement waiver in place (following litigation over the Biden administration’s attempt to stop it). While work requirement waivers were the subject of litigation during the Trump and Biden administrations, the Supreme Court never ruled on the issue leaving it open for future administrations. This issue brief highlights five key facts about Medicaid work requirements, including what research shows about the impact of work requirements.\n1. Most Medicaid adults under age 65 are working already, without a “work requirement.”\nAmong adults under age 65 with Medicaid who do not receive benefits from the Social Security disability programs, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and who are not also covered by Medicare, 92% were working full or part-time (64%), or not working due to caregiving responsibilities (12%), illness or disability (10%), or school attendance (7%) (Figure 1). The remaining 8% of Medicaid adults reported that they are retired, unable to find work, or were not working for another reason. Those in better health, with more education, and without disabilities are more likely to be working. Many Medicaid adults who work are employed by small firms or in industries (e.g., agriculture, service) with historically low employer-sponsored health insurance rates; even if eligible for job-based insurance, some low-wage workers may not take up the offer because it is not affordable to them.\n2. CBO estimates of national work requirements show lower federal spending and an increase in the number of uninsured, but no increase in employment.\nIn April 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a debt ceiling bill (HR 2811, the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023) that included a requirement for states to implement work requirements for certain Medicaid enrollees. While this bill never became law, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated (under this proposal) each year an average of 15 million enrollees would be subject to the requirements and 1.5 million would lose eligibility for federal funding, resulting in federal savings of $109 billion over a ten-year period (2023 – 2033). CBO analysis also showed the policy would increase the number of people without health insurance (by 600,000) but would not increase employment. CBO cited evidence of the effects of Medicaid work and reporting requirements implemented in Arkansas, the only state where a work requirement was established with disenrollment for noncompliance.\nA 2022 CBO report notes high rates of employment among SNAP and Medicaid recipients leave little room to increase employment rates further. When people (who are not working) have conditions that make it difficult to find and keep employment (e.g., disabilities, caregiving responsibilities etc.), CBO indicates work requirements are less likely to lead to employment and more likely to reduce income/benefits. Targeted work supports (e.g., childcare, transportation, job training) can boost employment for some; however, CBO notes Medicaid and SNAP do not provide such supports.\n3. In Arkansas, implementing Medicaid work requirements resulted in more than 18,000 people losing coverage.\nArkansas implemented Medicaid work and reporting requirements with consequences for noncompliance before a federal court deemed the work requirement unlawful. The requirements were in effect from June 2018 through March 2019. More than 18,000 people lost coverage, or about 25% of the population subject to the requirement, primarily due to failure to regularly report work status or document eligibility for an exemption. Researchers found work and reporting requirements in Arkansas were associated with losses in Medicaid coverage, an increase in the percentage of adults who were uninsured, and no significant change in employment—as nearly everyone targeted by the policy met the requirements already or qualified for an exemption. More recent research looking at two-year impacts of Arkansas’s work and reporting requirements found disenrollment was also associated with poorer medication adherence, delays in care, and medical debt.\nGeorgia has not expanded Medicaid under the ACA but expanded eligibility (under its “Pathways” waiver) to 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) for parents and childless adults, with initial and continued enrollment conditioned on meeting work requirements. The current waiver does not include any exemptions (e.g., for caregiving). The waiver was implemented in July 2023 and as of January 2025, the state had only enrolled about 6,500 adults, considerably short of the state’s own estimates (25,000 adults in the first year and 64,000 over 5 years). In August 2024, Georgia’s governor announced a $10.7 million ad campaign aimed at boosting Pathways low enrollment. The Pathways waiver expires in September 2025. The state is seeking changes in its waiver renewal application including allowing parents / caretakers of children up to age 6 (in households at or below 100% FPL) to receive Medicaid without work requirements and eliminating the requirement to monthly report work activities (in exchange for annual reporting).\n4. Evidence shows Medicaid work and reporting requirements are confusing to enrollees and complex and costly for states to implement.\nIn Arkansas, lack of awareness and confusion about the requirements were common. Despite robust outreach efforts, many enrollees were not successfully contacted. Lack of computer literacy and internet access were also barriers, as individuals were required to report on their work or exemption status monthly using an online portal. Providers reported the most vulnerable enrollees (e.g., people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness) were the most likely to face barriers in complying with the requirements. (While proponents of Medicaid work requirements often describe these policies as applying to “able-bodied” adults, people with disabilities may be subject to the requirements—as many people with disabilities do not meet criteria to receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and therefore qualify for Medicaid based on income (vs. disability status).) Although Arkansas’s program included safeguards intended to protect coverage for people with disabilities and others who should not have been subject to the requirements from losing coverage, few people used these safeguard measures relative to the number who lost coverage.\nFor states, implementing work requirements involves complex systems changes (e.g., developing or adapting eligibility and enrollment systems), enrollee outreach and education, and staff training. GAO examined selected states’ estimates of the administrative costs to implement work requirements and found costs varied from under $10 million to over $270 million. States estimated that federal funds would cover most of these costs, largely due to higher matching rates of 75% and 90% percent of applicable IT costs. GAO found CMS did not consider administrative costs when approving Medicaid work requirement demonstrations. According to data obtained by KFF Health News, Georgia’s “Pathways” program cost the state and federal government more than $40 million (through June 2024), with nearly 80% of costs spent on program administration and consulting fees (vs. paying for health care).\n5. Research shows access to affordable health insurance and care promotes individuals’ ability to obtain and maintain employment.\nResearch shows that being in poor health is associated with increased risk of job loss, while access to affordable health insurance has a positive effect on the ability to obtain and maintain employment. Many of the jobs held by people with low incomes involve walking, standing, lifting and carrying objects, repetitive motions, and other physical labor. Most Medicaid adults work in industries with low offer rates for employer-sponsored insurance, such as the agriculture and service industries. As a result, working does not replace the need for affordable coverage, including Medicaid coverage. Having access to regular preventive health care to manage chronic conditions, access medications, and address health issues before they worsen can help support work. In addition, an unmet need for mental health or addiction treatment results in greater difficulty with obtaining and maintaining employment, and Medicaid is an important source of coverage for mental health and addiction treatment services, such as opioid addiction.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        States waste hundreds of thousands on drug testing for welfare, but have little to show for it\nBy Amanda Michelle Gomez\nIn 2017, states spent more than $490,000 to drug-test 2,541 people who had applied for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits, which yielded just 301 positive tests.\nWhile the costs for these programs has dropped somewhat over the past three years, the number of positive tests has also declined.\nThis year, ThinkProgress also asked states to provide the questionnaires used to determine whether there is “reasonable suspicion” that their applicants/recipients are abusing drugs. The five states that didn’t provide this information said they license a copyrighted questionnaire from a for-profit company that prohibits disclosure of the questions.\nThe screening method is deeply flawed. The questions typically ask people to volunteer information about their own illegal drug use, and the questions vary widely between states. The vast majority in all but one state still tested negative, even after they were given screening questions, raising serious questions about the efficacy of these screening processes.\n“This is not an academic survey and it’s not a clinical tool that I’m doing for somebody at a treatment facility,” said University of Chicago professor, Dr. Harold Pollack, who’s studied drug testing in public assistance for more than a decade. “It’s a series of intrusive questions that I’m asking someone who is in economic need and has approached a public agency looking for assistance.”\nThe screening questions are asked arbitrarily and out of context, said Pollack. “I think there’s definitely an appropriate context in which I would ask someone these types of questions,” said Pollack. “If your children are showing up to school in dirty clothes and the school social worker starts looking into it, there’s a point where I would totally give someone a set of screening questions about substance use disorders… If someone shows up because don’t have enough money for food, it just strikes me as a real punitive moralistic thing that is not evidence-based.”\nFive states use Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI) from the for-profit SASSI Institute, which has published screening tools since 1988. The screening results, the company said in a statement, “do not provide evidence that an individual is using or abusing a controlled substance… A diagnostic interview is necessary to determine for which substances, if any, the client has a substance use disorder.” The institute also said that “[t]o use the SASSI to discriminate against individuals, such as disqualifying job applicants or to deny public assistance, violates the purpose of the SASSI and is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.” Still, the company licenses its questionnaire to states for precisely this purpose.\nBut even screeners like Wisconsin’s that have been well-studied and validated by the federal government, typically exclude alcohol so “the notion that this is being driven by concern about the recipients does not seem well-founded,” said Wendy Cervantes, senior policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy. “If the goal is to actually identify addiction issues that are interfering with people’s life functioning, alcohol is [as] likely to be the problem as any other drug.”\nDrug testing is one of those bad policy ideas that never seems to die. In fact, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers are trying to mandate drug testing in other public programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, no new states have added requirements in the past year, although bills have been introduced in Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Vermont in that time.\nBut data and expert testimony show lawmakers are wrong when they claim drug testing ensures no one’s taking advantage of government assistance or that it enables addiction treatment. It’s clear this policy only stigmatizes people who are in an already vulnerable situation.\n“Substance use disorder is less common than people think in the welfare population,” Pollack told ThinkProgress. “If you wanted to really find someone with an alcohol disorder, you can go right outside a football stadium in Arizona, Saturday morning… But we don’t do that in large part because we treat people who are seeking public benefits different and in a less respectful way.”\nSince a 2014 appeals court ruling struck down Florida’s unconstitutional universal drug testing requirement for all TANF applicants, states have implemented requirements that applicants and/or beneficiaries with a “reasonable suspicion” be tested. Thirteen states had such programs in operation in 2017. Those states are:\nAccording to the Alabama Department of Human Resources, 19,529 people in that state applied for TANF benefits in 2017, roughly half of whom were applications solely for benefits for children and therefore not subject to screening . These applicants were asked to make a declaration about whether they had any prior drug convictions and whether they had recently used any drugs forbidden by law or used prescription medications “for nonmedical reasons (meaning just because of the feeling or experience it provides).” That year, not a single applicant was asked to take a drug test. Indeed, since the state legislature enacted the 2014 lawmandating drug testing for TANF applicants and recipients with a “reasonable suspicion” of drug misuse, not a single person has tested positive.\nBarry Spear, a spokesperson for the department, told ThinkProgress that the law mandating the testing program expired at the end of September 2017, but “the screening and possible testing remains in our policy and will remain in policy for the foreseeable future. The policy helps protect taxpayer dollars and also aids the Department in identifying and assisting those who may have a drug problem.” But while he said the law cost the state no money last year, it also appears to have saved the state nothing.\nArkansas’ testing regime was only slightly more active, but a lot more costly. Some 3,430 of the 19,228 applicants for TANF in 2017 were screened for drug use via a two-question survey. Those who answered that in the previous 30 days they had used any illegal drugs or had lost/been denied a job due to current illegal drug use were required to take a drug test, according to the Arkansas Department of Workforce Services.\nJust five were given drug tests and only two of those admittedly recent drug users tested positive. Another eight refused to take the test. Though the testing itself cost just a couple hundred dollars, with staffing costs included the cost was $32,506.65, a spokesperson told ThinkProgress — an effective cost of more than $6,500 per test.\nThough the state’s drug testing requirement netted similarly few positive tests in 2016, the legislature made the law permanent in January 2017. At that time, the legislative sponsor called it a success, noting that the roughly $30,000-a-year price tag was much lower than the $1.2 million cost some predicted.\nOver 2017, Arizona’s Department of Economic Security made determinations on 81,286 TANF applications. As the state’s drug testing law applies only to adult recipients, rather than all applicants, only the 3,461 adult recipients (monthly average) were required to sign an “Illegal Drug Use Statement,” answering questions about illegal drug use and related employment or problems in the preceding 30 days.\nJust two people were given drug tests as a result of that screening process, both of whom tested negative. A third adult recipient “failed to complete the required drug test and was disqualified from the Cash Assistance program,” according to a department spokesperson. “Cash Assistance was authorized at a reduced grant amount for the other eligible members of the household.” He noted that the total cost for the two tests was $45.60.\nIn 2017, 22,523 Kansans applied for TANF benefits. The Department for Children and Families screened them and their ongoing recipients by a variety of methods including examining employment records, arrest records, a visual examination for signs of drug use or paraphernalia, and a questionnaire, among others, and, in the end, tested 220 for drugs. Only 46 of these tests came back positive — another 50 refused to take the test.\nA department spokesperson said the drug testing and lab costs, staff salaries and benefits, and various other operating expenses totaled $43,879.70 for the year — despite that the state was forced to raise taxes to address a massive budget deficit.\nKansas rejected an open records request for for a copy of the questionnaire saying the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory, which it licenses from the-for profit SASSI Institute, citing copyright law.\nMaine has 3,414 TANF applicants in 2017. Using the SASSI-3, another screening instrument from the SASSI Institute, the state’s Department of Health and Human Services drug tested seven recipients and all seven tested positive (another two were rejected for failure to complete the required test).\nA department spokesperson said the tests cost $744 and that the screening materials cost $100. This would put the total cost at $844. The state did not provide the SASSI-3 questions.\nThe most expensive drug testing program was Missouri’s: it cost the state a whopping $336,297 in public funds to test 108 applicants. Just 11 came back positive, and 305 applicants did not show up for a drug test or refused. The state had 32,774 total TANF applicants that year.\nThe communications director Missouri Department of Social Services noted that applicants can waive the testing requirement if they wish to be referred to a substance abuse treatment program. That spokesperson also asked ThinkProgress to “refrain from publishing the drug screening question verbatim as it may give some participants an unfair advantage in knowing the question prior to the interview.”\nBut it wasn’t a complicated test. Applicants were given an one-question screening to determine reasonable suspicion: they were asked how many times in the past year they had used illegal drugs or prescription medication for nonmedical reasons.\nMississippi had 11,407 TANF applications in 2017. After being screened via an online version of the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory, 464 were given drug tests (and another 26 did not complete the required drug testing for various reasons).\nJust six positive tests were recorded — and the total cost to the state was $8,493. A spokesperson for the state’s Department of Human Services was not able to provide the SASSI screening questions.\nOf the 28,828 applicants for WorkForce, North Carolina’s TANF benefits program in 2017, 258 were given drug tests by the Department of Health and Human Services, after receiving a score of eight or more on weighted 10-question survey about drug use. Of those tested, 31 tested positive; another 20 refused to take the test and 171 did not show up to do so.\nA spokesperson told ThinkProgress that the cost for the process was $14,410.\nSome 13,361 Oklahomans applied for TANF in 2017 and 3,915 of those were subject to the state’s drug screening requirements. After taking a SASSI screening questionnaire, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services sent 1,196 to a second level of screening, a 90-minute-plus meeting with a mental health professional called the “Addiction Severity Index.” Of those, 841 were given a drug test — just 77 of those tested positive.\nA spokesperson told ThinkProgress that the state does not track refusals and that the cost for the program was $50,294.48. She also told ThinkProgress that the state is not permitted to reproduce any part of the SASSI, even under the Oklahoma Open Records Act.\nIn 2017, 13,058 new applicants were received by the Tennessee Department of Human Services for its TANF/Families First program. The adults applying were then required to answer a three-question screener about any use of or problems relating to marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines/amphetamines, and opiates over the preceding three months.\nOf those who were deemed to use “controlled substances,” 164 were given drug tests, 26 tested positive. Another 95 did not complete the required test within the 45-day time limit. The total cost, according to a spokesperson, was $5,279.25.\nUtah’s law requires recipients of the Family Employment Program, part of the state’s TANF program, to be screened for drugs. In 2017, this group included 3,068 Utahans.\nA spokesperson for the state’s Department of Workforce Services told ThinkProgress that the state uses SASSI to screen those recipients. “We are not authorized to share a hardcopy or electronic version of the tool,” she wrote.\nOf the 450 recipients given a drug test, 94 tested positive. Another 94 were rejected for refusal or failure to take the test. The state paid $30,775.50 for this program, plus staffing costs.\nWest Virginia is the most recent state to enact a drug testing requirement for WV WORKS, its TANF program. Enacted by the state legislature in 2016, implementation of the the pilot testing program began on October 20, 2017. Between that day and the end of the year, 798 were given the state’s 15 question DAST-10 “drug use questionnaire.”\nThe questionnaire asked about drugs “excluding alcohol and tobacco” used in the past 12 months. But the questions are confusing and imprecise: some questions could receive a positive response even from someone who only used prescription medications as directed, such as “Do you ever feel bad or guilty about your drug use?” and “Have you ever experienced withdrawal symptoms (felt sick) when you stopped taking drugs?” Even a single positive response means the state “must drug test” the applicant. Anyone convicted of any “drug-related offense” within the previous three years was also required to take a drug test, regardless of their answers to the other questions.\nSomehow, just 83 people were given a test as a result of this screening. Only 4 of those tested positive. Another five did not complete the required drug test. The year cost of implementing the program estimated to be $50,172, a Department of Health & Human Resources spokesperson told ThinkProgress.\nWisconsin’s drug testing program applies only to non-custodial parents, “a very small subset of TANF recipients” in programs administered by the Department of Children and Families,” a spokesperson told ThinkProgress. Just 2,012 applicants were screened in 2017 — via a 10-question screener — and 29 were given drug tests.\nThe tests netted just three positive results; two more applicants refused to submit a drug test. The cost, the spokesperson estimated, was between $725 and $2,900, primarily due to different testing locations. He noted that the three who failed were referred for treatment, but that there was no cost to the state for that. as it is “the payer of last resort.”\nA new rationale for the same bad policy idea\nFor years, lawmakers who advocated for drug testing have said they don’t want taxpayers funding drug habits. Now, as lawmakers are forced to confront drug addiction due to the opioid epidemic, many say drug testing is a way to enable substance use disorder treatment.\n“Those who test positive will have the opportunity to get treatment, regardless of the ability to pay, so they can get healthy,” said Gov. Scott Walker in a statement when he tried to extend drug testing to the state’s FoodShare program.\nTesting positive for a drug does not automatically mean a person has a substance use disorder — and to insinuate this is to fundamentally misunderstand addiction.\n“We’re in a place now where we are trying to destigmatize substance use disorder, and we are seeing a lot of lawmakers talk about the need to provide treatment and that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem,” said Drug Policy Alliance’s Grant Smith. “But in the same breath, we are seeing some of these same lawmakers insist that we screen for substance use, as if someone who [tests positive] inherently doesn’t deserve benefits.”\nFor Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI), who was on cash assistance during college and has since spent her career trying to change the country’s punitive welfare system, this kind of testing is not only harmful, but insulting.\n“I would have been offended by the notion that I had to give up my constitutional rights, my presumption of innocence, my privacy… I would have had a fit,” Moore told ThinkProgress. But she said she could also see herself being so desperate for help that she’d take the drug test.\n“I would have been one of those people trying to figure out which lawyer would have took my case and I would have been denied benefits — which I probably wouldn’t have been able to afford.”\nExperts told ThinkProgress if public officials really wanted to address substance use disorder, they would expand access to health care or take other steps to expand access to treatment. Ten of the 13 states that impose drug testing did not expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), even though Medicaid covers a disproportionate share of people with opioid addiction.\nCatasys Chief Medical Officer and addiction expert Omar Manejwala recently talked to ThinkProgress and took a dim view of mandatory testing. “The biggest danger from this is it makes you feel like you are doing something, when you are doing nothing.”\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}
