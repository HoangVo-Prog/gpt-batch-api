This is mainly due to loopholes and special breaks that the 2017 tax law left in place and, in some cases, introduced. Corporate tax avoidance occurs because Congress allows it to occur, and the Trump tax law in many ways made it worse. The corporate minimum tax and expanded tax enforcement funding signed into law in 2022 by President Biden could begin to reduce corporate tax avoidance, as would other proposals from the White House that have not yet become law.\nThis study examines federal corporate income taxes paid by the largest profitable corporations from 2018 through 2022. Because the corporations included in this study were profitable each year for all five of those years, one would reasonably expect that they would pay significant taxes. But in many cases, they did not.\n- The 342 companies included in this study paid an average effective income tax rate of just 14.1 percent during this five-year period, almost a third less than the statutory rate of 21 percent.\n- Nearly a quarter of the corporations in this study (87 companies) paid effective tax rates in the single digits or less during this five-year period.\n- Of these, 55 (16 percent of the total 342 companies) paid effective rates of less than 5 percent. This is particularly striking given that all these companies were profitable for at least five years consecutively. Companies paying less than 5 percent include T-Mobile, DISH Network, Netflix, General Motors, AT&T, Bank of America, Citigroup, FedEx, Molson Coors, Nike, and many others.\n- Twenty-three corporations paid zero federal tax over the five-year period despite being profitable in every single year. And 109 corporations paid zero federal tax in at least one of the five years.\n- At the other end of the spectrum, 50 corporations paid effective tax rates of more than 21 percent, but most of these companies were also the beneficiaries of large tax breaks because they were paying taxes from previous years that they delayed using depreciation breaks.\nThe low effective corporate tax rates found in this study demonstrate the need for substantial tax reform, of which the new corporate minimum tax that was signed into law by President Biden is a welcome first step. Of proposals currently being advanced, an even more important additional step would be the global minimum tax negotiated by the Biden administration but currently blocked by Congress.\nFederal Income

this study, 2022, many of these corporations could ultimately pay less than what this report finds. Congress may retroactively repeal a tax increase related to research and development that took effect in 2022, which was enacted as part of the Trump tax law. An alternative version of the numbers in this study, adjusted to show how much this could lower taxes paid by certain corporations, is provided at the end of this report.\n- The tax subsidies received by corporations from 2018 through 2022 (meaning the difference between 21 percent of their profits and what they actually paid during this period) come to $275 billion. Just 25 corporations claimed $155 billion of those total tax breaks.\n- The industries enjoying the lowest five-year effective tax rates were utilities (negative 0.1 percent); oil, gas, and pipelines (2.0 percent); motor vehicles (3.2 percent); and telecommunications (7.7 percent).\nHow the 2017 Tax Law Enabled Continued Corporate Tax Avoidance\nWhen President Trump and Congressional Republicans slashed the statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, they could have maintained or even increased the effective rate paid by corporations by shutting down special breaks and loopholes in the corporate income tax. But from the very beginning of the debate over the 2017 legislation, it was clear their goal was to allow corporations to contribute less to the public investments and the society that makes their profits possible.\nMost American corporations pay an effective federal income tax rate (meaning a share of their profits in taxes) that is much lower than the statutory rate. Most companies paid an effective rate far lower than 35 percent when the statutory federal corporate income tax rate was 35 percent. And today, most pay an effective rate far lower than 21 percent.\nThis is not because these corporations are violating tax laws, at least not as these laws are being interpreted and enforced today. Tax avoidance occurs because Congress chooses to allow it, either by enacting special exceptions and breaks from the regular tax rules, or by leaving in place loopholes that are clearly being exploited.\nThe 2017 law did little to change this – except to allow companies to pay less than ever.\nITEP has documented the results since the Trump tax law has been in effect. An ITEP report finding that 55 large, profitable corporations avoided paying any federal corporate income taxes in 2020 was cited repeatedly by President Biden in arguing for the reforms that Congress eventually enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).[1] ITEP followed that with a report showing that even among corporations that were profitable each year for three years in a row, many paid little or nothing under the Trump tax law.[2]\nThis report goes further, examining corporations that have been profitable each year for five years, 2018 through 2022, and still finds many that paid very little in federal income taxes under the 2017 law.\nThis study takes this approach because, while focusing on a single year provides many insights, we can learn even more by following corporations’ tax liability over time. Some defenders of the existing corporate tax system argue that it is designed to require businesses to pay a reasonable share of their profits in taxes over several years, even if they pay little or nothing in one particular year.\nFor example, consider a company with losses in one year and profits over the next four years. The losses in one year become a tax benefit in profitable years. The company can carry a portion of the losses forward into each of the four profitable years, reducing the taxable income that the company reports to the IRS during those years. If the rules work properly, the company will pay a reasonable amount of taxes over the five-year period compared to its profits.\nThis report demonstrates the current rules often do not work properly. Each of the companies included in this study were profitable for each of the five years and yet many did not pay a reasonable amount of taxes compared to their profits.\nThis analysis is based on information that publicly traded corporations report to shareholders and potential investors in their annual 10-K reports. It uses the profits that companies report, as well as the “current” federal income tax they report for the year, which is their best estimate of the corporate federal income tax they will pay for the year.\nThe low effective corporate tax rates found in this study demonstrate the need for the new corporate minimum tax that was signed into law by President Biden and which came into effect in 2023. Because many corporations have not yet filed their 10-K for 2023, we do not yet have data telling us what effect the IRA’s minimum tax has had. That law is designed to ensure that the largest corporations pay a worldwide effective tax rate of at least 15 percent, which would sharply limit some of the most significant tax avoidance by the largest companies.\nThis study examines the U.S. taxes corporations pay on their U.S. profits, not the worldwide taxes they pay on their worldwide profits, so a low effective tax shown for a particular corporation in this report can strongly suggest, but not determine conclusively, that it could be affected by the IRA’s minimum tax.\nAn even stronger potential reform is the global minimum tax that the Biden administration negotiated with the rest of the world’s governments in 2021. Other countries are moving ahead with implementing this tax, but Congress has yet to pass legislation to implement it here.\nThe global minimum tax is designed to clamp down dramatically on offshore tax dodging by corporations. It is particularly strong because it imposes a minimum tax on profits that corporations earn in each country where they do business rather than just applying a minimum to their overall worldwide profits as the IRA’s minimum tax does.\nDrafters of the Trump tax law made some token efforts to address these problems, for example, by imposing a weak U.S. tax on certain profits that American corporations claim to earn offshore. This left the corporate income tax in dire need of the Biden administration’s efforts to reform it.[3]\nMany Corporations Could Ultimately Pay Even Less Thanks to Congress\nThe taxes paid by corporations may turn out to be even lower than what is shown in this report, particularly for the final year covered 2022. The higher effective tax rates of many corporations shown for 2022 compared to other years reflect the few provisions that raised corporate taxes in the Trump tax law, and which went into effect in 2022. When the 2017 law was enacted, these provisions were characterized as somewhat restraining the overall cost of the corporate tax cuts in the legislation. But now Congress is contemplating retroactively repealing these tax increases for several years, starting in 2022.[4]\nThe most important of these cost-containing provisions is the elimination of a special break for research and development (R&D) expenses. A bill passed by the House of Representatives in January would repeal this provision of the 2017 tax law and retroactively reinstate the R&D break for four years starting in 2022.\nPotential Impact of Proposal to Repeal the Trump Tax Increase on Research and Development\n| 2022 effective tax rate | ||||\n| Corporation | Potential benefit |\nShare of total |\nAs reported |\nUnder expensing |\n| Microsoft | $6.49 billion | 19% | 28% | 15% |\n| Meta | $6.48 billion | 19% | 25% | –2% |\n| Lockheed Martin | $2.27 billion | 7% | 25% | –10% |\n| Cisco Systems | $1.89 billion | 6% | 17% | 2% |\n| Northrop Grumman | $1.67 billion | 5% | 22% | –7% |\n| General Motors | $1.57 billion | 5% | 4% | –13% |\n| 76 other companies disclosing R&D effect | $13.96 billion | 41% | 23% | 12% |\n| 82 companies disclosing R&D effect | $34.32 billion | 100% | 23% | 8% |\nSource: ITEP analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings of publicly traded corporations\nOf the corporations included in this study, 82 reported that this R&D provision raised their taxes by $34 billion altogether in 2022. Most of that impact was on just six corporations. The table above illustrates how a retroactive repeal of R&D capitalization could lower these companies’ 2022 tax bills. The “as reported” effective tax rate figures are based on the taxes these companies reported in 2022 in their annual financial reports. The “under expensing” versions of these figures show how much lower these 2022 tax rates could be if Congress fully eliminates their R&D tax increase.\nIt is impossible to know with certainty just how much of any company’s R&D tax increase would be fully eliminated because Congress may leave part of the tax increase in place. The House-passed bill would repeal the tax increase for R&D conducted in the U.S. but leave it in place for R&D conducted offshore. (Corporations do not report what portion of their tax increase is for domestic R&D vs. foreign R&D.) The table above therefore provides a range of possible tax amounts and effective tax rates for 2022 for these companies.\nThe R&D provision makes a small but noticeable difference for the aggregate totals covering the entire 5-year period. For example, the average effective tax rate for the 342 companies in this report falls from 14.1 percent to 13.2 percent if we assume the 2022 R&D tax increase is repealed entirely for all companies disclosing a tax effect in this study. (Other companies in the study likely would see a similar tax effect but are not included in this estimate because they did not disclose that effect.)\nBut for certain corporations this change could be more dramatic. The end of this report provides alternative figures showing how much lower the tax bills for affected corporations could be as a result.\nLawmakers should spend more time examining whether this tax break is truly rewarding what most people would think of “research” that benefits society enough to warrant a subsidy provided through the tax code. Most people would probably reject the idea that Nike should receive a tax break for figuring out how to produce more comfortable shoes, or that Chipotle or Campbell Soup should receive this tax break for researching ways to modify their foods. But these are examples of companies that claimed to be affected by the R&D provision.\nThe Size of the Corporate Tax Subsidies\nSpecial breaks and loopholes allowing corporations to pay less than would be the case under the basic tax rules and the 21 percent corporate rate are corporate subsidies provided through the tax code. The total tax subsidies received by corporations over 5 years is the difference between what they would have paid on their $4 trillion in profits if they really paid the statutory rate of 21 percent and what they actually paid during this period (which was just 14.1 percent of their profits). The total tax subsidies for the companies included in this report from 2018 through 2022 come to $275 billion.\nThe majority of the tax breaks, $155 billion, went to just 25 companies, each with more than $2 billion in subsidies. Bank of America topped the list, with $23.9 billion over five years. Several other companies each reported more than $10 billion over the past five years, including AT&T ($17.7 billion), J.P. Morgan Chase ($16.7 billion), and Verizon ($13.7 billion).\n25 Companies with the Largest Total Tax Subsidies, 2018-2022\n| Corporation | Tax breaks |\n| Bank of America | $23.89 billion |\n| AT&T | $17.68 billion |\n| J.P.

This means that this industry collectively paid zero federal income taxes over the five-year period taken as a whole. This astonishing result was largely driven by these companies’ ability to immediately expense their capital investments.\nEffective Corporate Tax Rates for 342 Corporations by Industry, 2018-2022 (Five-Year Totals)\n| Industry | Profit (in millions) | Tax (in millions) | Rate |\n| Utilities, gas and electric | $175,495 | –$200 | –0.1% |\n| Oil, gas & pipelines | $39,333 | $787 | 2.0% |\n| Motor vehicles and parts | $41,059 | $1,313 | 3.2% |\n| Telecommunications | $351,618 | $27,023 | 7.7% |\n| Miscellaneous services | $224,628 | $26,812 | 11.9% |\n| Financial | $925,759 | $120,165 | 13.0% |\n| Semiconductors & other electronic components | $63,849 | $8,401 | 13.2% |\n| Food & beverages & tobacco | $109,405 | $15,697 | 14.3% |\n| Industrial Machinery | $72,065 | $10,493 | 14.6% |\n| Medical Products and Equipment | $23,753 | $3,480 | 14.7% |\n| Miscellaneous manufacturing | $185,774 | $27,512 | 14.8% |\n| Computers, Office Equipment | $161,325 | $24,578 | 15.2% |\n| Engineering & construction | $37,019 | $5,702 | 15.4% |\n| Transportation | $100,967 | $15,618 | 15.5% |\n| Aerospace & defense | $98,668 | $15,570 | 15.8% |\n| Electronics, electrical equipment | $2,250 | $372 | 16.5% |\n| Chemicals | $35,241 | $5,831 | 16.5% |\n| Household & personal products | $71,177 | $11,917 | 16.7% |\n| Metals & metal products | $43,466 | $7,410 | 17.0% |\n| Network and other communications equipment | $55,432 | $9,703 | 17.5% |\n| Financial data services | $116,183 | $20,602 | 17.7% |\n| Retail & wholesale trade | $481,041 | $86,849 | 18.1% |\n| Information Technology Services | $14,722 | $2,658 | 18.1% |\n| Computer software | $206,578 | $38,847 | 18.8% |\n| Internet Services & Retailing | $106,271 | $20,501 | 19.3% |\n| Health care | $160,059 | $32,432 | 20.3% |\n| Pharmaceuticals | $86,302 | $22,218 | 25.7% |\n| ALL INDUSTRIES | $3,989,440 | $562,288 | 14.1% |\nSource: ITEP analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings of publicly traded corporations\nSeveral other industries reported five-year tax rates that collectively were less than half the statutory 21 percent tax rate, including oil, gas, and pipelines (2.0 percent); motor vehicles and parts (3.2 percent); and telecommunications (7.7 percent).\nEffective tax rates also varied widely within these industries. For example, telecom giant AT&T reported a 2.6 percent federal tax rate over five years, while Comcast’s tax rate was 15.8 percent. In the manufacturing sector, Nike reported a 4.9 percent five-year rate, while 3M’s tax rate clocked in at 16.7 percent. And beer giant Molson reported a 4.8 percent five-year rate, less than a quarter of the 23.1 percent rate reported by soft drink maker Keurig Dr. Pepper.\nThe wide differences of tax treatment between competing companies in the same industrial sector are troubling, in part, because they raise the possibility that companies are using the tax system to gain a competitive advantage over other firms in the same sector.\nHow Corporations Avoid Taxes\nThe tax avoidance illustrated in this analysis is mainly the result of provisions enacted by Congress. Lawmakers often justify these provisions as necessary to achieve some important goal, such as encouraging investment or research. But they seem to accomplish little beyond reducing tax revenue that could pay for public investments.\nAccelerated Depreciation\nProvisions for accelerated depreciation allow companies to write off the costs of investments in equipment more quickly than the equipment wears out and loses value. The most likely outcome is that this rewards companies for making investments they would have made absent any tax break.[5] The Trump tax law allowed companies to immediately write off the full costs of investments, which is the most extreme version of accelerated depreciation. This “bonus depreciation” was scheduled to eventually phase out under the 2017 law but legislation the House passed in January would extend it for several years.\nIn theory, accelerated depreciation is merely a shift in the timing of tax payments. Tax deductions that would otherwise be taken later are taken now, and taxes that would otherwise be paid now are paid later. But companies that continue to take advantage of accelerated depreciation can make this benefit last a very long time or indefinitely and essentially enjoy interest-free loans from the IRS.\nStock Options\nSome companies reduce their taxes by using a break for stock options that they typically pay to their executives. This tax break allows companies to write off stock-option related expenses for tax purposes that go far beyond expenses they report to investors.[6]\nThe benefit of this tax break tends to go overwhelmingly to a small number of highly profitable companies in the tech sector. Six companies in our sample reported over $1 billion of stock option tax benefits during the five years from 2018 to 2022. These include Apple ($6.3 billion), Microsoft ($6.1 billion), J.P. Morgan Chase ($4.7 billion), Meta ($2.5 billion), Nike ($1.1 billion), and Netflix ($1.0 billion).\nTax Credits\nTax breaks for stock options and accelerated depreciation allow companies to report smaller profits to the IRS than they report to shareholders and potential investors in their 10-K. In some cases, corporations may simply pay 21 percent of the profits they report to the IRS as federal income taxes. But many corporations use tax credits to further reduce their tax liability.\nThe most significant tax credit is the research tax credit, which is supposed to encourage innovation but often rewards companies for research they would have conducted in the absence of any tax break.\nMost corporations do not explain in their 10-K how much they save specifically through the research tax credit, but some do. For example, Apple disclosed over $4 billion of research tax credits from 2018 through 2022. Microsoft and Meta reported $3.4 and $2.2 billion, respectively. And 54 other companies in our sample disclosed smaller research credits. The video game maker Activision Blizzard reported $300 million of research credits over five years, while the dating site Match Group claimed $94 million and craft retail platform Etsy claimed $72 million.\nOffshore Profit-Shifting\nAnother likely explanation of the tax avoidance we identify is offshore profit-shifting. The analysis in this report is based on the U.S. federal income taxes that companies pay on the profits they report (to shareholders and potential investors) having earned in the United States. However, it is possible that some of these profits are reported quite differently to the IRS.\nCorporations can use convoluted accounting schemes to make the profits they earn in the United States appear to be earned in countries like Ireland, which has a very low corporate tax rate, or countries like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, which have no corporate tax.\nThe drafters of the Trump tax law passed up an opportunity to stop American corporations from shifting profits in this way to offshore tax havens. For example, many or most of the profits that American corporations report earning through their offshore subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. taxes at all. When they are, the tax rate they pay does not exceed 10.5 percent, just half of the rate that applies to domestic profits under the law.\nCorporate Tax Rate Data\n- Effective Federal Corporate Income Tax Rates of Corporations, 2018-2022 in Alphabetical Order\n- Alternative Version of Effective Federal Corporate Income Tax Rates of Corporations, 2018-2022 in Alphabetical Order\nAppendix 1: Methodology\nThis study assesses the health of the U.S. corporate income tax by looking at how it has affected the largest and most profitable corporations in America over the five years from 2018 through 2022. The study’s research concept and methodology closely follow the approach used in a series of reports by Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy for the past 40 years. This latest edition of this long-running series looks at 342 of the largest corporations in America and analyzes the federal income taxes reported by each of these companies on their U.S. pretax income over the five years from 2018 through 2022. The report calculates, for each company in the sample, an effective federal income tax rate (that is, current federal income tax expense as a share of pretax U.S. income) for each of these five years. All information presented in this study is taken from the “10-K” annual financial reports that publicly traded corporations are required to file each year with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe sample selection for the companies included in this study begins with the complete universe of publicly traded, U.S.-based corporations in the Fortune 500 (a ranking that is based on revenues) and the S&P 500 (a ranking based on market capitalization). From this initial list, we excluded companies that reported a U.S. pretax loss in any year from 2018 through 2022. We also excluded companies that failed to provide sufficient information to calculate U.S. pretax income, or current federal income tax, or (in some cases) both. (For example, the hugely profitable corporation Goldman Sachs does not publish a pretax income estimate for the United States. Berkshire Hathaway does not publish an estimate of current federal income tax.) Finally, we excluded companies that, while consistently profitable, did not publish information for all five years between 2018 and 2022, either because their IPO took effect after 2018 or because the company was acquired or otherwise transformed before 2022. This left us with the 342 companies included in this report.\nThe tax expense reported by the 342 companies included in our final sample from 2018 through 2022 was 40 percent of total federal corporate income tax collections during that time. (If we expanded our sample to include companies with one loss year, it would include 64 percent of all federal corporate income tax collections during this five-year period.) The effective tax rates published in this study are based entirely on data published by these companies in their annual financial reports. In most cases, the effective tax rate for any year is the product of three numbers: U.S. pretax income, current federal income tax, and current state income tax (which is subtracted from pretax income to get net pretax income). The effective federal income tax rate is calculated as: current federal tax / (U.S. pretax income – current state tax).\nThe use of current federal tax expense is important because current taxes are those the company is obligated to pay during the year and excludes “deferred” income taxes that the company technically owes but is allowed to postpone paying until a later year.\nThe pretax incomes published in this study are generally what the companies themselves reported. In some cases, the published numbers are modified. First, when companies with a (small) multinational presence fail to disclose the geographic split of pretax income, we calculated the U.S. and foreign income share using data on the geographic location of operating profit (where available), or, more frequently, we estimated foreign income using reported foreign tax.\nA second infrequent modification to the published data relates to “noncontrolling interest income.” This is income of a company’s subsidiary that is reported on financial statements as part of income, but that is not taxable to the corporation. When substantial noncontrolling interest income was disclosed, we subtracted it from U.S. and/or foreign pretax income.\nA third modification to published income data relates to “goodwill impairments.” These are non-cash, non-taxable charges against income that are taken irregularly by companies to reflect a sharply diminished estimate of the company’s future earnings potential. These charges genneraly affect neither a company’s income taxes nor its cash flow. When these impairments were disclosed, we added them back to reported pretax income.\nOn the tax side, reported current federal income tax expense was infrequently adjusted in one of two ways. The first has to do with the one-time “transition tax” on pre-2018 earnings imposed by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Companies were required to add the expected value of this transition tax to current tax in the ongoing fiscal year when the law was enacted in December 2017. Many of these companies reported an impact in their fiscal year 2018, either because their fiscal year does not follow the calendar year or because the companies made second-year or even third-year revisions to their initial estimate of transition tax expense. Wherever these transition tax expense amounts were disclosed, we subtracted them from reported current tax, because this tax expense was based entirely on pre-2018 income, and therefore should not be part of an effective tax rate calculation for 2018 income.\nWe also subtracted the value of Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) expense in the limited number of cases where it was disclosed, because this feature of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is explicitly levied against foreign income, not U.S. income.\nAppendix 2: Why We Use Corporate Annual Reports\nThe data presented in this study do not show the income and tax amounts from companies’ actual corporate tax returns, for the simple reason that these returns are not publicly available. We instead use the annual financial reports, otherwise known as “10-K” reports, in which these companies must report estimates of their “current income taxes” under oath. Current income tax represents the companies’ own best assessment of their income tax bills for the year and are the only available measure of what corporations pay in income taxes broken down by payments to the federal government, state governments and foreign governments.\nThe federal current tax expense is exactly what the company expects its current year tax bill to be when it files its tax return. If the calculation of the income tax provision was done perfectly, the current tax expense would exactly equal the total amount of tax shown on the tax return. But (for companies that have fiscal years that follow the calendar year) the income tax provision is calculated in February as the company is preparing its 10-K for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the company’s tax return isn’t usually filed until September. While the company’s tax return is prepared over those several months, things will be found that weren’t accounted for in the financial statement income tax provision, and numbers that were estimated in February will be refined for the actual return. Those small differences will be included in the following year’s current tax expense, but the impact on our calculations is minimal (especially because we look at the rates over a period of years). If the differences in any one year were material, accounting rules would require the company to restate their prior-year financials.\nOur report focuses on the federal income tax that companies are currently paying on their U.S. profits. For this reason, we look at the current federal tax expense portion of the income tax provision in the financial statements. The “deferred” portion of the tax provision is tax based on the current year income but not due yet because of the differences between calculating income for financial statement purposes and for tax purposes. When those timing differences turn around, if they ever do, the related taxes will be reflected in the current tax expense.\nThe complaint that “current income tax expense” is not an accurate measure of taxes actually paid does contain one important kernel of truth, however: the amount of tax expense reported in the 10-K is almost always more than what companies end up paying. This is because of the special way companies are allowed to treat dubious tax benefits, otherwise known as “unrecognized tax benefits” or UTBs. UTBs are tax breaks that companies claim on their tax returns, but which they expect the IRS (or other taxing authority) to disallow. Accounting rules say that even though companies claim these UTBs on their tax return, they are not allowed to report them on their financial statements until (and if) these dubious tax benefits are given the green light by tax administrators.\nFor example, suppose a corporation tells the IRS on its 2021 tax return that it owes $700 million in federal income tax for the year. But the corporation’s tax staff believes that on audit, the corporation will most likely owe an additional $300 million, because $300 million in tax benefits that the company claimed on its tax return are unlikely to be approved by the IRS. As a result, the corporation’s current income tax for 2021 that it reports to shareholders (and that we calculate in our reports) will be $1,000 million, the amount that the corporation expects to owe in income taxes. This possibly overstated number is what’s tabulated in the current study.\nOf course, if the corporation’s tax staff is correct, and the entire $300 million of already-claimed tax breaks are disallowed by a well-funded and vigilant IRS, the $1,000 million in reported current income tax for 2021 will turn out to have been correct. In 2022, when the dubious tax benefits are disallowed, the company will have to pay back the $300 million (plus interest and penalties) to the IRS. Reasonably enough, the corporation will not report that payback in later 10-k’s, since they’ve already reported it as paid in 2021.\nIf, on the other hand, the IRS chooses not to disallow these dubious tax breaks, the $300 million will be subtracted from current federal income tax expense in the following year’s annual report.\nAppendix 3: Example of Corporations Excluded From This Study\nThis report only includes corporations that were consistently profitable in the U.S. throughout the five-year period from 2018 to 2022. In other words, if a firm had a loss in even one year during this period, it is excluded from this report. By leaving out corporations that had losses (which means they wouldn’t pay any income tax), this report provides a more straightforward picture of how the federal income tax system treats the large, profitable companies it was designed to apply to.\nTwo Highly Profitable Corporations Excluded From This Report\n| Five-year totals ($ in millions) | In Profitable Years ($ in millions) | In Loss Years ($ in millions) | |||||||\n| Profit | Tax | Rate | Profit | Tax | Rate | Profit | Tax | Rate | |\n| Amazon.com | $69,254 | $6,172 | 8.90% | $78,553 | $3,997 | 5.10% | –$9,299 | $2,175 | –23.4% |\n| Exxon Mobil | $14,790 | $1,532 | 10.40% | $41,731 | $1,270 | 3.00% | –$26,941 | $262 | –1.0% |\nSource: ITEP analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings of publicly traded corporations\nThis approach forced the exclusion of some high-profile tax avoiders, most notably Amazon (which reported a single-digit federal income tax rate on $79 billion of U.S. income from 2018 through 2021 but reported a domestic and worldwide loss in 2022), and ExxonMobil (which reported single-digit tax rates on over $30 billion in 2021 and 2022 but also reported a single year of unprofitability in 2020). Including the profitable years of these and similar companies in our calculations would likely have further lowered the effective tax rates we report here.\nIn addition to unprofitable companies, we also excluded companies that did not provide sufficient information to calculate effective tax rates. While the Securities and Exchange Commission requires publicly traded companies to disclose basic information about the location of their income and tax expense, some do so in a way that is insufficiently clear to use (for example, Berkshire Hathaway reports worldwide current tax, and the sum of current and deferred federal income tax, but never disaggregates current federal income tax expense). Other companies simply do not disclose the geographic split of income at all.\nSome consistently profitable companies were excluded from the study because they did not report data for all five years from 2018 through 2022. This includes several companies whose initial public offering took place after 2018 (privately owned companies typically do not publish 10-K financial reports).\nEndnotes\n[1] Matthew Gardner and Steve Wamhoff, “55 Corporations Paid $0 in Federal Taxes on 2020 Profits,” Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, April 2, 2021. https://itep.org/55-profitable-corporations-zero-corporate-tax/\n[2] Matthew Gardner and Steve Wamhoff, “Corporate Tax Avoidance Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, July 29, 2021. https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-under-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/\n[3] Steve Wamhoff, “Unfinished Tax Reform: Corporate Minimum Taxes,” Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, October 4, 2022. https://itep.org/unfinished-tax-reform-corporate-minimum-taxes/\n[4] Steve Wamhoff and Joe Hughes, “Impacts of the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act,” Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, February 2, 2024. https://itep.org/impacts-of-tax-relief-for-american-families-and-workers-act/\n[5] Steve Wamhoff and Richard Phillips, “The Failure of Expensing and Other Depreciation Tax Breaks,” November 19, 2018, Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. https://itep.org/the-failure-of-expensing-and-other-depreciation-tax-breaks/\n[6] Elise Bean, Matthew Gardner and Steve Wamhoff, “How Congress Can Stop Corporations from Using Stock Options to Dodge Taxes,” December 10, 2019, Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. https://itep.org/how-congress-can-stop-corporations-from-using-stock-options-to-dodge-taxes/\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        PoliticsMeasure 118 promises Oregonians more money, but it could come at a costBy Dirk VanderHart (OPB)Oct. 2, 2024 1 p.m.The complex proposal to hike business taxes and divide the proceeds among residents is the most divisive measure on the Oregon ballot.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a Sponsor📨 Daily news in your inboxSign up today for OPB’s “First Look” – your daily guide to the most important news and culture stories from around the Northwest.EmailPlease leave this field blankSign up\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        At least 55 of the largest corporations in America paid no federal corporate income taxes in their most recent fiscal year despite enjoying substantial pretax profits in the United States. This continues a decades-long trend of corporate tax avoidance by the biggest U.S. corporations, and it appears to be the product of long-standing tax breaks preserved or expanded by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as the CARES Act tax breaks enacted in the spring of 2020.\nThe tax-avoiding companies represent various industries and collectively enjoyed almost $40.5 billion in U.S. pretax income in 2020, according to their annual financial reports. The statutory federal tax rate for corporate profits is 21 percent. The 55 corporations would have paid a collective total of $8.5 billion for the year had they paid that rate on their 2020 income. Instead, they received $3.5 billion in tax rebates.\nTheir total corporate tax breaks for 2020, including $8.5 billion in tax avoidance and $3.5 billion in rebates, comes to $12 billion.\nThis report is based on ITEP’s analysis of annual financial reports filed by the nation’s largest publicly traded U.S.-based corporations in their most recent fiscal year. All data presented here come directly from the income tax notes of these reports. Some companies with unusual fiscal years have not yet filed such reports. Some publicly traded corporations paid nothing on profits in their most recent fiscal year but are not included in this report because they are not part of the S&P 500 or Fortune 500.\nNo-Tax Corporations Continue a Decades-Long Trend\nFor decades, the biggest and most profitable U.S. corporations have found ways to shelter their profits from federal income taxation. ITEP reports have documented such tax avoidance since the early years of the Reagan administration’s misguided tax-cutting experiment. A widely cited ITEP analysis of an eight-year period (2008 through 2015) confirmed that federal tax avoidance remained rampant before the TCJA.\nNow, with most corporations reporting their third year of results under the new corporate tax laws pushed through by President Donald Trump in 2017, it is crystal clear that the TCJA failed to address loopholes that enable tax dodging—and may have made it worse.\nThe companies avoiding income taxes in 2020 represent very different sectors of the U.S. economy:\nFood conglomerate Archer Daniels Midland enjoyed $438 million of U.S. pretax income last year and received a federal tax rebate of $164 million.\nThe delivery giant FedEx zeroed out its federal income tax on $1.2 billion of U.S. pretax income in 2020 and received a rebate of $230 million.\nThe shoe manufacturer Nike didn’t pay a dime of federal income tax on almost $2.9 billion of U.S. pretax income last year, instead enjoying a $109 million tax rebate.\nThe cable TV provider Dish Network paid no federal income taxes on $2.5 billion of U.S. income in 2020.\nThe software company Salesforce avoided all federal income taxes on $2.6 billion of U.S. income.\nThe U.S. income, current federal income tax and effective tax rates in 2020 for all 55 of the zero-tax companies are shown in the following table.\nCompanies’ Low Tax Rates Rely on a Variety of Familiar Tax Breaks\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission requires publicly traded companies to disclose U.S. pretax income, federal and state income tax paid on that income, and any significant factors affecting tax expense. For this reason, we can generally describe the tax breaks used by these 55 companies to get their tax expense to zero.\nMore than a dozen used a tax break for executive stock options to sharply reduce their income taxes last year. These include Advanced Micro Devices, Archer Daniels Midland, Booz Allen Hamilton, Charter Communications, Nike, and Salesforce.com. This tax break allows companies to write off stock-option related expenses for tax purposes that go far beyond expenses they report to investors.\nAt least half a dozen companies used the federal research and experimentation (R&E) credit to reduce their income taxes in 2020. These include HP, Nike, Jacobs Engineering, Advanced Micro Devices and Ecolab.\nTax breaks for renewable energy are part of the tax avoidance scheme for several companies, including Qurate Retail, Xcel Energy, DTE, and Duke Energy.\nA provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allowing companies to immediately write off capital investments—the most extreme version of accelerated depreciation—helped several companies reduce their income tax substantially. Consolidated Edison, Williams, PPL and Sealed Air all used depreciation tax breaks to substantially reduce current income tax expense, as did at least a dozen other companies.\nNotably, there is much we cannot know about factors reducing federal effective income tax rates for these corporations. The Securities and Exchange Commission only requires the disclosure of any tax provision that individually has a significant effect on tax rates and companies routinely take advantage of this limitation to combine the effect of different tax provisions into a single line item. For example, Sealed Air, Seaboard and Sanmina each disclose a substantial effect of “tax credits” on their income tax expense—a disclosure that tells us little about which provisions of tax law are involved. In the case of multinational corporations, it is often unclear whether the tax credits mentioned reduce U.S. taxes or foreign taxes.\nHow the CARES Act Creates Zero-Tax Corporations\nBesides the standard array of tax breaks described above, the 2020 data introduce a new factor driving down corporate tax bills: the CARES Act, ostensibly designed to help people and businesses to stay afloat during the pandemic. Some companies used a CARES Act provision to “carry back” 2018 or 2019 losses to offset profits they reported in prior years, resulting in a rebate that reduced their 2020 taxes, in some cases to less than nothing.\nTax law previously allowed companies to carry back losses to offset profits in two prior years. The TCJA bars companies from doing this (although it still allows companies to carry losses forward to offset profits in future years). However, the CARES Act temporarily restored companies’ ability to carry back losses and, incredibly, is more generous than the pre-TCJA rules.\nThe CARES Act loosened rules for the treatment of losses not just in 2020, but also retroactively for losses reported in 2018 and 2019, which have nothing to do with the pandemic. Even worse, it allows corporations to carry back losses as far as five years. This means losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 can offset income taxed at the higher 35 percent tax rate in effect before 2018. Taxing profits at one rate while allowing losses to produce savings at a higher rate is an invitation for companies to play games, moving profits and losses around from one year to another on paper to reduce their tax bills.\nThe limited disclosures made by these 55 companies suggest that this opportunity is not lost on the leaders of profitable firms. These companies enjoyed at least $500 million of tax breaks last year from the CARES Act provision liberalizing loss carrybacks. In at least four cases (Mohawk Industries, Telephone & Data Systems, Treehouse Foods and Westlake Chemical), the CARES Act’s temporary tax benefit for loss carrybacks exceeds the full 21 percent tax liability these companies would have paid on their pretax profits in 2020 if no tax breaks were available to them.\nThe total tax benefits these 55 companies enjoyed from the carryback provisions are likely even larger. Several companies acknowledged substantial CARES Act benefits but did not separate the effect of the carryback changes. Other companies very likely chose not to disclose CARES Act benefits because their size was not “significant” for financial reporting purposes.\nNot Just a Flash in the Pan: 26 Companies Pay Zero Federal Income Tax Over the Entire TCJA Era So Far\nCorporate effective tax rates tend to be volatile, just as are corporate earnings. Yet for many companies reporting paying no tax on their profits in 2020, this result is part of a longer-term pattern. As the table below shows, 26 of the 55 companies were profitable tax avoiders for the three-year period during which the TCJA has been in effect. These 26 companies were profitable in each of the three years (2018, 2019 and 2020) and their total corporate federal income tax over that period was zero or negative.\nDuke Energy paid, on balance, no federal income taxes on a total of $7.9 billion over the first three years of the TCJA.\nFedEx achieved the same zero tax result on almost $6.9 billion of U.S. income during the past three years.\nAnd Nike has paid no federal income tax in the TCJA era on $4.1 billion of U.S. pretax income.\nAll told, these 26 companies reported $77 billion in pretax U.S. income in the first three years of the TCJA, and collectively enjoyed a tax rebate of $4.6 billion.\nConclusion\nWhen President Trump signaled his intention to cut corporate taxes in 2017, he and Congress had an opportunity to pare back the many loopholes that have allowed companies to avoid tax on much of their income since the early 1980s. But now, with three years of data published on the effective tax rates paid by publicly traded companies, it is clear that the TCJA has not meaningfully curtailed corporate tax avoidance and may even be encouraging it.\nFortunately, the policy remedies Congress shunned in 2017 remain available today. By paring the tax breaks identified in this report, or by re-introducing some form of a “minimum tax” requiring profitable companies to pay at least some tax in any profitable year, Congress and President Biden could take a major step toward a fairer and more sustainable tax system.\nAnother ITEP report explains in more detail how corporations avoid taxes, why this is a problem and what Congress can do about it.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors of this report would like to thank ITEP tax interns David Crawford and Devin Douglass for their work tabulating data for this analysis.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

EDT\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Hello, everyone. Please have a seat. Once again, I’m honored to welcome my good friend, Prime Minister Lee, and his delegation back to the White House. I have been fortunate to work with the Prime Minister throughout my presidency and I always value his insight, his counsel, and his outstanding partnership.\nLet me say that our thoughts today are also with former President Nathan, and we join the people of Singapore in praying for his full and speedy recovery.\nAs President, I’ve rebalanced American foreign policy so that we’re playing a larger and long-term role in the Asia Pacific -- a region that is critical to our security and our prosperity. And as I said this morning, Singapore has played a vital role in that rebalance. With Singapore’s support, the United States is engaging more deeply than ever across the region -- including through ASEAN and the East Asia Summit. Given its strategic location, Singapore is an anchor for the U.S. presence in the region, which is the foundation of stability and peace.\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you for the invaluable contributions that Singapore has made to a central pillar of our foreign policy.\nToday, we agreed to continue building on this progress. The U.S. and Singapore are united in our commitment to advancing regional security and stability. Our defense relationship remains one of the closest in Southeast Asia, with hundreds of American ships and aircraft rotating through Singapore each year. As I told the Prime Minister, we welcome Singapore’s interest in purchasing the F-35 aircraft, and we’ll also explore the possibility of Singaporean troops training on Guam.\nAt the same time, we’ll continue working to strengthen regional institutions like ASEAN, in line with the principles we agreed to at Sunnylands earlier this year. And we reaffirmed our shared commitment to building a regional order where all nations play by the same rules and disputes are resolved peacefully -- including in the South China Sea.\nWe agreed to do more to encourage economic growth and innovation among our economies. With a little over a decade, trade between our two countries has grown more than 50 percent. We’re collaborating to jumpstart greater digital innovation, including research and development into technology and data to prove and promote Smart Cities concepts that can improve the daily lives of our citizens. We’ll do more to connect our vibrant start-up communities so that an engineer in Singapore can collaborate more easily with an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley or Austin, Texas.\nWith respect to trade, this is an issue that stirs great passion. Globalization means that economies around the world are more integrated than ever, and jobs and capital move across borders. Automation means that goods and products can be produced with fewer workers. And these forces of globalization and technology have not always benefitted everybody evenly. There are fears and anxieties that people may be left behind. And these anxieties are legitimate. They can’t be ignored. They have to be taken seriously. As I've said before, it means that we have to do everything we can to make sure that everybody shares in prosperity, that we have strong rules to protect workers, to promote high wages, to make sure that our citizens are getting the education and the training that they need.\nBut the answer cannot be to back away from trade and the global economy. It is here to stay. It's not possible to cut ourselves off given how integrated our economies are. And trying to pull up a drawbridge on trade would only hurt us and hurt our workers. So the answer is to make sure that globalization and trade is working for us, not against us.\nAnd that’s why, today, we are reaffirming our commitment to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I’m a strong supporter of TPP because it will reduce tariffs -- taxes, basically -- on American goods, from cars to crops, and make it easier for Americans to export into the fastest-growing markets of the world. TPP levels the playing field for our workers and helps to ensure countries abide by strong labor and environmental rules.\nSo this is an opportunity to grow our economies and write the rules for trade in the 21st century in a way that's equitable. It gives us a chance to advance American leadership, reduce economic inequality, and support good-paying jobs -- all while strengthening critical strategic relationships in a vital region.\nSo I think not only is TPP important, but the Prime Minister and I agreed that we need to extend our partnership beyond just regional efforts. We have work to do on a global scale. Singapore was the first country in Southeast Asia to join the global coalition to destroy ISIL, and we’re grateful that Singapore is making new contributions to this effort by providing valuable medical support to coalition forces.\nAs two nations on the forefront of digital innovation, we recognize the growing threats of cyberattacks, and we're going to continue to work to strengthen cybersecurity and to promote peaceful norms on how nations should operate in cyberspace.\nSingapore, the Garden City, helped to achieve the Paris climate agreement last year. And, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your commitment to work towards joining the Paris agreement this year. We're also working close with the international community to reduce harmful aviation emissions and phase down HFCs. And our two countries will continue to work to advance global health security so that the world is better prepared to address the threat of pandemics.\nLast point. We agreed to keep promoting people-to-people ties between our two countries. We're expanding our Trusted Travelers program to make it easier for Americans and Singaporeans to visit each other and do business together. I welcome Singapore’s announcement of a new exchange program, which will include scholarships for students of our two countries. And through our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, we're going to keep empowering young people in Singapore and across the region to become the leaders of tomorrow in their own communities in business and in civil society.\nI’ll note that I had a chance to meet one of those young Singaporean leaders at a YSEALI summit in Kuala Lumpur last year, a remarkable young woman named Carrie Tan, who is helping underprivileged women become financially self-sufficient. When Carrie talked about coming together with young people from across Southeast Asia, she said, \"We bonded in our common endeavor to seek to understand and learn from one another in pursuit of our aspirations to a better world.\"\nYoung people like Carrie give me hope. And, Prime Minister Lee, based on our work together, I am confident that Singapore and the United States will continue to advance our shared aspirations for a better world for many years to come.\nWith that, let me turn it over to you, Mr. Prime Minister.\nPRIME MINISTER LEE: Well, thank you, President Obama.\nPresident Obama, distinguished guests, I am very happy to be here on an official visit for the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. I’d like to thank President Obama for his gracious hospitality and for his attention to our bilateral relations, as well as to the wider Asia Pacific, and specifically also for his good wishes on the condition of our former president, Mr. S.R. Nathan.\nThe President and I had a substantive conversation on a wide range of issues. We affirmed our strong multifaceted and longstanding partnership. Our strong economic ties are underpinned by the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Singapore is America’s largest trading partner in Southeast Asia, where the U.S. is Singapore’s largest foreign direct investor. And many American companies run their regional headquarters in Singapore, and there are many Singapore companies also which are in America. And the relationship deepens year by year.\nIn the defense area, we have robust cooperation under the ambit of a MOU in 1990, and the Strategic Framework Agreement, which we concluded in 2005.\nLast year, we concluded the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which expands cooperation into new areas, like humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, cyber defense, and counterterrorism.\nWe are also deepening security cooperation between our agencies in areas like counterterrorism, cybercrime, corruption, transportation security, and illicit trade enforcement, and expanding into new areas like cybersecurity, where our agencies are signing an MOU to work together to protect national security and our economic interests against cyberattacks.\nWe also share an interest in Smart Cities, so we’ve discussed how cities can use technology to tackle problems from health care to transportation to delivery of public services. And there’s a lot of interest from companies on both sides.\nUnderpinning the ties between the two countries are the friendships and the relationships between our peoples. Thousands of American students are studying and working in Singapore. Thousands of Singaporeans are studying and working in America. And last Sunday, I hosted a National Day reception for Singaporeans in our embassy here, and 600 people showed up. It’s fitting to mark this special occasion of our 50th anniversary that we are launching a scholarship for Singaporeans and Americans to enable undergraduates to do some exchanges in each other’s country and grow our young people closer together, and to get to know each other’s societies, cultures, strengths, and opportunities to cooperate together.\nWe've recently implemented a Trusted Traveler program that will also facilitate travel by Singaporeans to the U.S.\nThe President and I also discussed the TPP. And just now you heard the President give an eloquent explanation of why it is important to America and also to Asia. It’s an integral component of America’s rebalance to Asia. Apart from the economic benefits -- trade, market access, standard setting -- it's also vital from a strategic point of view and a strong signal of the U.S. commitment to continue its deep engagement in the region.\nWe greatly appreciate the efforts of the President and his team to push for the TPP, which grew from a small FTA -- which Singapore had started together with Chile, Brunei and New Zealand, the P4 Group -- and now the TPP will be a free trade agreement encompassing 40 percent of the world's population and one-third of the world's GDP. We are near the finish line, and we hope that the countries -- particularly the U.S. -- will be able to ratify the TPP as soon as possible.\nFinally, the President and I discussed our partnership in tackling global challenges, like counterterrorism. It's a problem for all countries. Every day in the newspapers you read of new attacks somewhere -- America, Europe, the Middle East, closer to home in Indonesia and Malaysia. We, in Southeast Asia, are very concerned about this because the terrorists are active in many countries in the region. Several hundred, perhaps a thousand, from Southeast Asia are in the Middle East fighting ISIS. And we have witnessed attacks in both Indonesia and Malaysia that were mounted by ISIS followers under orders from ISIS operatives in the Middle East to launch attacks in their home countries.\nSo the efforts to counter ISIL, or ISIS, are crucial. And that's why Singapore is a member of the coalition. And we are making a modest contribution to the effort, and we're going to be sending a medical team to Iraq. We have already been participating with air-to-air refueling, image interpretation, and in other ways. And now we are going to send a medical team into Iraq.\nIt is also important to fundamentally address a root source of violent extremism in order to counter the underlying ideology of ISIL, as well as to address the issues of extremist and exclusive views being propagated by ISIL.\nSo these are major issues which we have discussed amongst our two countries, and we look forward to working together and taking our relationship even further forward.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you.\nFirst question is Margaret Brennan.\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. Given the Republican nominee's recent comments about the Khan family and his statement that, if President, he would consider recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, does it make you question his fitness to be President?\nAnd secondly, sir, on Libya. You've said in the past that the worst mistake of your presidency may have been your failure to plan for the aftermath of that 2011 NATO intervention in Libya. Do you see your new decision to bomb ISIS there as a direct result of that?\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as President. I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it. The notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country, the fact that he doesn’t appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia, means that he's woefully unprepared to do this job.\nAnd this is not just my opinion. I think what's been interesting is the repeated denunciations of his statements by leading Republicans, including the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader, and prominent Republicans like John McCain. And the question I think that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him? What does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer? This isn’t a situation where you have an episodic gaffe. This is daily, and weekly, where they are distancing themselves from statements he's making. There has to be a point in which you say, this is not somebody I can support for President of the United States, even if he purports to be a member of my party.\nAnd the fact that that has not yet happened makes some of these denunciations ring hollow. I don’t doubt their sincerity. I don’t doubt that they were outraged about some of the statements that Mr. Trump and his supporters made about the Khan family. But there has to come a point at which you say somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn’t have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.\nBecause a lot of people depend on the White House getting stuff right, and this is different than just having policy disagreements. I recognize that they all profoundly disagree with myself or Hillary Clinton on tax policy or on certain elements of foreign policy. But there have been Republican Presidents with whom I disagreed with, but I didn’t have a doubt that they could function as President. I think I was right, and Mitt Romney and John McCain were wrong on certain policy issues, but I never thought that they couldn’t do the job. And had they won, I would have been disappointed, but I would have said to all Americans they are -- this is our President, and I know they’re going to abide by certain norms and rules and common sense, will observe basic decency, will have enough knowledge about economic policy and foreign policy and our constitutional traditions and rule of law that our government will work, and then we’ll compete four years from now to try to win an election.\nBut that’s not the situation here. And that’s not just my opinion; that is the opinion of many prominent Republicans. There has to come a point at which you say, enough. And the alternative is that the entire party, the Republican Party, effectively endorses and validates the positions that are being articulated by Mr. Trump. And as I said in my speech last week, I don’t think that actually represents the views of a whole lot of Republicans out there.\nWith respect to Libya, I have said on several occasions that we did the right thing in preventing what could have been a massacre, a blood bath in Libya. And we did so as part of an international coalition and under U.N. mandate. But I think that all of us, collectively, were not sufficiently attentive to what had to happen the day after, and the day after, and the day after that, in order to ensure that there were strong structures in place to assure basic security and peace inside of Libya.\nThe good news is, is that we now have the beginnings of a government in the Government of National Accord. They are serious about trying to bring all the factions together to start creating a basic security structure to begin to monitor Libya’s borders and to cooperate internationally to deal with issues like ISIL penetration on their territory. And at the request of that government, after they had already made significant progress against ISIL and had essentially pushed ISIL into a very confined area in and around Sirte, it is in America’s national security interest in our fight against ISIL to make sure that they’re able to finish the job. And so we’re working in partnership with them to assure that ISIL does not get a stronghold in Libya, even as Libya begins what is going to be a long process to establish a functioning government and security system there.\nSo the good news is that they recognize this terrorist organization in their midst is contrary to their national interests as well as the world’s. And we’re hopeful that having completed this process of driving ISIL out, they will then be in a position to start bringing the parties together inside that country. And not only us, but the Europeans and other countries around the world have a great interest in seeing stability in Libya, because that -- the absence of stability has helped to fuel some of the challenges that we’ve seen in terms of the migration crisis in Europe and some of the humanitarian tragedies that we’ve seen in the open seas between Libya and Europe.\nQ Thank you, PM Lee and President Obama. First question is for Prime Minister Lee. You’ve spoken about the continuation of the U.S. rebalance being a significant part of peace and stability in Asia. How do you envision this continuation proceeding in the next 50 years, and what role do you see Singapore playing in this context? What are some of the hot-button issues that we’re likely to face as the U.S. hopefully continues its rebalance?\nSecond question. You’ve mentioned the strong bipartisan links that Singapore has had with nine different U.S. Presidents from both sides of the political divide, a very strong record there. How would we address a U.S. leader which adopts the stance that it's more closed off, more anti-globalization, for example, if we see that in November?\nPresident Obama, I have a question about the military collaboration which has been a cornerstone of the relationship between Singapore and the U.S., especially coming on the heels of the latest announcement of the medical team to the global coalition against ISIS. With the rising threat of terror in Asia, and indeed the rest of the world, the potential for military confrontation in the South China Sea, how do you see Singapore featuring in U.S. plans to address this going forward?\nAnd last question. “Four more years” is a phrase that I think you’ve been hearing a little bit in the past few weeks and months. And while that’s not possible -- (laughter) -- if it were, how would you continue developing relationships with Singapore? What would be your key focus going forward, maybe the next 50 years, as well? Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER LEE: Well, 50 years is a very long time. Fifty years ago -- 50 years ago, nobody imagined what the world would be like today or what Singapore would be like today, and that we would have such a deep and broad relationship and so many things to do together.\nWe would like to build on this for the next 50 years. It depends on how each of our countries does in Singapore, whether they're able to remain stable, prosperous, open, successful; in America, whether you remain one of the dynamic, vibrant, leading economies in the world -- in a world in which there are other powers, other centers of creativity and technology and science and progress, but yet it's a unique participant with a history of contributing to the world not just for your own interest but because you believe that the world should be a better place for all countries.\nAnd if America can do that, and if Singapore can maintain our success, then I think there are many opportunities for us to make common cause together. And then, the rebalancing, which the President has enunciated and executed, will sustain and endure for many years to come. It will be a very different world. The countries will grow; other countries will slow down. Demographics will have a big factor to come. I mean, if we look at Japan, their population has been shrinking and they will have to do something, somehow, to turn it around. Otherwise 50 more years of population shrinking and you have a very small country left in terms of economy, in terms of influence internationally.\nSingapore, too, has demographic issues. America has a demographic change -- the population is not shrinking, but the composition is changing. And in this situation, we have to adjust to a new world, maintaining our position and our ability to compete, and yet knowing that it's not going to be the same as it was in 1946 when America was about half the world's GDP -- or one-quarter of the world's GDP.\nSo that's the crucial factor over the next 50 years. As for what we do over bipartisan links, if there's a U.S. leader who is more closed off and wants to turn inward, I don't think this is the right forum or indeed there is any right forum for me to talk about U.S. politics in public at this moment. We will work with whoever is the U.S. administration, whichever party. We've worked with five Republican and four Democratic administrations. And our experience of American elections, presidential elections, has been that many pressures build up during the election campaign. And after the elections, in a calmer, cooler atmosphere, positions are re-thought, strategies are nuanced, and a certain balance is kept in the direction of the ship of state. It doesn't turn completely upside down.\nThe Americans take pride in having a system with checks and balances so that it is not so easy to do things, but it is not so easy to completely mess things up. (Laughter.) And we admire that and sometimes we depend upon that. (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: He's absolutely right. (Laughter.) The wisdom of our Founders.\nWith respect to military cooperation, obviously Singapore is a small country, but as I've said before, it punches above its weight. Because so much of our work in the Asia Pacific region is not a matter of active conflict, but rather creating an architecture, a framework of rules and norms that keeps the peace and that has underwritten security for the region and for us for many years now. And Singapore is so often the adult in the room, the level head, that can help us work with a wide range of countries around certain issues, help defuse tensions. In many ways, the diplomatic work and collaboration that we do with Singapore is as critical, if not more critical, than the work militarily.\nBut what is also true is the nature of threats today, when you think of cyber threats or our concern about enforcing sanctions against North Korea to ensure nonproliferation of nuclear materials, or being able to counter-message ISIL in a place like Southeast Asia, and ensure information-sharing with countries where there may be a budding terrorist threat -- those are all issues of military finesse and intelligence and precision, and those are areas where Singapore excels.\nSo in addition to being a very important logistical hub and center for our operations, the partnership that we're able to maintain helps us to work with a whole range of other countries much more effectively than we would if Singapore weren't there and we were having to just try to gather up all these countries individually. And that's where ASEAN and the East Asia Summit I think has also been very important, because it is institutionalizing many of these practices in ways that hopefully avoids conflict in the first place, which would be in everybody's interest.\nAs far as where the relationship goes, I think the Prime Minister is absolutely right -- 50 years from now, it's very hard to anticipate where we're going, but there are certain trends that I think are inevitable. The Asia Pacific region will continue to grow and it will continue to account for a larger share of the world’s economy. There are going to be countries in the Southeast Asian region that look to follow the path of Singapore into a mature, advanced economy. It is going to be a big market. And the United States is still going to have a massive interest in maintaining itself as a Asia Pacific power and in maintaining strong bonds of trade and commerce, and scientific exchange and educational exchange.\nAnd given the close strategic interests, but maybe even more importantly, the close people-to-people ties between America and Singapore, I think that we can anticipate that that will be just as strong 50 years from now as it is today.\nSingapore has to take into account not just American interests. China is a big neighbor and there are strong commercial ties and cultural ties there as well. And in that sense, Singapore actually can serve as a useful partner with us and with China to assure that the U.S.-Sino relationship moves in a productive way, which I think would be in the interest of both countries.\nSo this is going to be a central engine for world growth. And if we do a good job in maintaining stability, ensuring a rules-based order, continuing to promote greater transparency in reducing corruption in the region so that all people are benefitting from the rapid growth that is taking place, then I think the future 50 years from now will be bright.\nJordan Fabian.\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. You're here today touting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but Hillary Clinton is against it. Her vice presidential nominee, Tim Kaine, has now reversed himself and is now against it. Donald Trump is, too, meaning that the next President is opposed to this deal. So my question is, if you take both candidates at their word, how do you plan to get Congress to pass this deal during the lame duck, and what’s your plan to convince members to do so given the opposition I just described?\nAnd secondly, security officials inside and outside the government have said they’re almost certain that the hack of the Democratic National Committee came from Russia. Does it look to you like Russia is meddling in the U.S. election? And what impact should that have on your administration’s relationship with Moscow?\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, right now, I'm President, and I'm for it. And I think I've got the better argument. And I've made this argument before; I'll make it again. We are part of a global economy. We're not reversing that. It can't be reversed, because it is driven by technology, and it is driven by travel and cargo containers, and the fact that the demand for products inside of our country means we've got to get some things from other places, and our export sector is a huge contributor to jobs and our economic wellbeing. Most manufactured products now involve a global supply chain where parts are made in all corners of the globe, and converge and then get assembled and packaged and sold. And so the notion that we're going to pull that up root and branch is unrealistic. Point number one.\nPoint number two. It is absolutely true, the evidence shows that some past trade deals have not delivered on all the benefits that were promised and had very localized costs. There were communities that were hurt because plants moved out. People lost jobs. Jobs were created because of those trade deals, but jobs were also lost. And people who experienced those losses, those communities didn't get as much help as they needed to.\nAnd what is also true as a consequence of globalization and automation, what you've seen is labor, workers losing leverage and capital being mobile, being able to locate around the world. That has all contributed to growing inequality both here in the United States, but in many advanced economies. So there’s a real problem, but the answer is not cutting off globalization. The answer is, how do we make sure that globalization, technology, automation -- those things work for us, not against us. And TPP is designed to do precisely that.\nNumber one, it knocks out 18,000 tariffs that other countries place on American products and goods. Our economy currently has fewer tariffs, is more open than many of our trading partners. So if everybody agrees that we're going to have lower tariffs, that's good for American businesses and American workers. And we should want that, we should pursue it.\nNumber two, the complaint about previous trade deals was that labor agreements and environmental agreements sounded good, but they weren’t enforceable the same way you could complain about tariffs and actually get action to ensure that tariffs were not enforced. Well, TPP actually strengthens labor agreements and environmental agreements. And they are just as enforceable as any other part of the agreement. In fact, people take them so seriously that right now, for example, Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms in Vietnam, changing their constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time.\nSo what we're doing is we're raising standards for workers in those countries, which means it’s harder for them to undercut labor standards here in the United States. The same is true for environmental standards. The same is true for things like human trafficking, where we’ve got a country like Malaysia taking really serious efforts to crack down on human trafficking. Why? Because TPP says you need to. It gives us leverage to promote things that progressives and people here in this country, including labor unions, say they care about.\nSo if you care about preventing abuse of workers, child labor, wildlife trafficking, overfishing, the decimation of forests, all those things are addressed in this agreement. I have not yet heard anybody make an argument that the existing trading rules are better for issues like labor rights and environmental rights than they would be if we got TPP passed.\nAnd so I’m going to continue to make this case. And I’ve got some very close friends, people I admire a lot, but who I just disagree with them. And that’s okay. I respect the arguments that they’re making. They’re coming from a sincere concern about the position or workers and wages in this country. But I think I’ve got the better argument, and I’ve got the evidence to support it.\nAnd hopefully, after the election is over and the dust settles, there will be more attention to the actual facts behind the deal and it won’t just be a political symbol or a political football. And I will actually sit down with people on both sides, on the right and on the left. I’ll sit down publicly with them and we’ll go through the whole provisions. I would enjoy that, because there’s a lot of misinformation.\nI’m really confident I can make the case this is good for American workers and the American people. And people said we weren’t going to be able to get the trade authority to even present this before Congress, and somehow we muddled through and got it done. And I intend to do the same with respect to the actual agreement.\nYou had a second question. That was a long answer. I apologize, Mr. Prime Minister, but every once in a while --\nQ The DNC hack by Russia.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Oh. The FBI is still doing an investigation. You’re right that there have been some assessments made that this might have been a Russian hack.\nWhat I can tell you without commenting on the specifics is that there are a lot of countries out there that are trying to hack into our stuff -- governmental databases, but also private sector databases and non-for-profit databases. And this is why we’ve stood up such an aggressive effort to strengthen our cybersecurity.\nAnd we have provisions in place where if we see evidence of a malicious attack by a state actor, we can impose potentially certain proportional penalties. But that requires us to really be able to pin down and know what we’re talking about. And so I don’t want to get out ahead of the legal evidence and facts that we may have in order to make those kinds of decisions.\nMore broadly, we’re trying to promote international norms and rules that say there are certain things that states should not be doing to each other when it comes to cyberattacks. There are certain things that are out of bounds. And those norms I think are going to slowly build and get more adherence over time. But it’s -- we’re still early in the process. I mean, in some ways, the explosion of the Internet and its importance to our communication systems has far outstripped the legal architecture to protect them, and we’re playing catch-up. But we’re going to have to keep on at it.\nIn terms of how it affects our relationship with Russia -- look, I think we’ve already got a lot of differences with Russia on a whole bunch of issues. But I think that we’ve been able to try to stay focused on those areas where we still have a common interest, understanding that we have deep disagreements on issues like Ukraine, but perhaps, potentially, we have an interest in bringing an end to violence in Syria. How do we balance those issues -- that’s pretty standard statecraft at this point with Russia.\nIf, in fact, Russia engaged in this activity, it’s just one on a long list of issues that me and Mr. Putin talk about and that I’ve got a real problem with. And so I don’t think that it wildly swings what is a tough, difficult relationship that we have with Russia right now. But it’s not going to stop us from still trying to pursue solutions so that we can, for example, implement the Minsk Agreement and get Russia and those separatists to lay down arms and stop bullying Ukraine. That’s not going to stop us from trying to make sure that we can bring a political transition inside of Syria that can end the hardship there.\nPRIME MINISTER LEE: Can I say something about the TPP? I don’t want to wade into your domestic politics, but looking at it from somebody on the other side of the Pacific who has been intimately involved and, in fact, triggered the whole process, because we started the P4, the little FTA on which the TPP formed, and has become this important initiative.\nThe economic arguments for the TPP in terms of trade -- I think the President has presented them eloquently, what the benefits are to American companies. It’s a deal which the countries have negotiated, each one providing market access on their side in return for gaining market access on the other side, each one committing to rules in exchange for the other side committing to rules. It’s a hard-fought bargaining process. The negotiators spent many trips, many nights, many dawns, and fought it out.\nBut actually, at the end of it, everybody must decide, is it a plus or a minus for them. And I think in your case, Mike Froman did a very good job as USTR. Our various trade representatives and negotiators did their best to make sure that they could bring back something which the political leaderships could stand by and support. And it’s an achievement that all the members of the TPP, at the end of this, are still with us, and nobody has dropped out of this. So, obviously, there is something in it for each one of us.\nAnd I think we should also look at the other side of the economic benefit, which is not the producers -- I am making, I am exporting, therefore I am earning a job -- but also I am spending, I am consuming, I am importing, and because it's freed up trade, I am getting a wider range of products, of services, of opportunities, which will improve my livelihood. People talk about Walmart, that products come from all over Asia. Who benefits -- Walmart? Many people in America, not just exporters, but even people living in the Rust Belt, people living in the Midwest. These are part of your everyday invisible standard of living, and yet it's real and it's valuable.\nSo in terms of the economic benefits, the TPP is a big deal. I think in terms of America's engagement of the region, you have put a reputation on the line. It is the big thing which America is doing in the Asia Pacific with the Obama administration, consistently over many, many years of hard work and pushing. And your partners, your friends who have come to the table, who have negotiated, each one of them has overcome some domestic political objection, some sensitivity, some political cost to come to the table and make this deal.\nAnd if, at the end, waiting at the altar, the bride doesn't arrive, I think there are people who are going to be very hurt, not just emotionally but really damaged for a long time to come. Mr. Abe, for example, several of his predecessors thought seriously about and decided not to participate in the TPP. They came very close. They prepared the ground, they walked away. But Mr. Abe came through and decided to commit. Why? Because he wants to help. He wants his country to benefit and to open up its markets, and this is one way to do it.\nAnd you don't do this, while it hurts Mr. Abe is one thing, but it hurts your relationship with Japan, your security agreement with Japan. And the Japanese, living in an uncertain world, depending on an American nuclear umbrella, will have to say, on trade, the Americans could not follow through; if it's life and death, whom do I have to depend upon It's an absolutely serious calculation, which will not be said openly, but I have no doubts will be thought.\nI think if you go beyond that, I'd like to link up the TPP question with another question from Nicholas, which is, where do we go over the next 50 years? And that really depends whether we go towards interdependence and therefore peaceful cooperation, or whether we go for self-sufficiency, rivalry, and therefore a higher risk of conflict.\nAsia has tried both. The world has tried both. In the 1930s with Smoot-Hawley, with the Depression, with a very difficult international environment, you went for protectionist policies, you had a rivalry with Japan, which led to war. After the war, because America was open, because you promoted trade, because you encouraged investments and encouraged other countries to open up, therefore the Asia Pacific has been peaceful and the Pax Americana has been a pax and not a war.\nIf over the next 50 years, you continue to work towards interdependence and cooperation and mutual prosperity, then 50 years from now we can say these have been peaceful years and we have made further progress together. But if you go in the opposite direction, and you decide that this is a big Pacific but it's big enough to split it down the middle, and one chunk is mine and the other chunk belongs to some of the Asians -- China or India or Japan -- I think that's a very different world.\nOne of the reasons why you don't have a -- you have a manageable relationship with China now is because you have trade with them. It's enormous, it's mutually beneficial; both sides want to maintain that relationship. If you didn't, it would be like the Soviet Union during the Cold War when you had negligible trade and while you still had to find ways to work together, but it's much harder.\nNow, the TPP doesn't include China, although some people think it does, but the TPP points the direction towards the world, towards your whole orientation of your society. And if you set the wrong direction, maybe in the next 50 years sometime you will turn around, but it will cost you many years and the world will have to pay quite a high price.\nQ Good afternoon, President Obama and Prime Minister Lee. I have two questions. The first is just a follow-up to the TPP. I mean, a lot has been said -- everyone knows what's at stake -- but what is the future of the TPP if it does not get ratified by January, the lame duck session? The fear is that if things wait too long, it might need to be reopened up for renegotiation and that will probably kill the deal. So what is -- post-January, how can we reassure the TPP nations and the people that there is the political will to get this done as soon as possible?\nThe second question is for President Obama. We are almost at the end of your eight years in office. I would like you to evaluate the progress of the U.S. rebalance to Asia. What is something that you're most proud of? Is there something that you would have done differently? And what is your message to your successor, whoever he or she may be, to continue to engage Singapore, Southeast Asia, and the rest of the Asia Pacific? Thank you.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, with respect to TPP, I thought that Prime Minister Lee’s points were right on target. And this is an economic agreement, but what we've learned in history is, is that you can't separate out economic interests and issues and security issues and interests.\nAnd the Prime Minister is absolutely right. We have benefitted from enormous peace and prosperity around the world, an unprecedented period where the great powers were not engaged in conflict, in part because of growing interdependence. If you think about those parts of the world where we still see conflict, where we still see high levels of violence, they're typically places that are less integrated into the world economy, and there’s a reason for that.\nSo I think there is a powerful economic case, just a basic bread-and-butter case to be made about why this is good for Americans workers and good for American exports and ultimately good for American wages, if it’s structured properly. But I also think that there is a strong security component to this. And what I also think is important is for people to recognize that the alternative is not TPP or some imaginary circumstance in which suddenly we're able to sell goods around the world wherever we want, but nobody is able to sell goods to us; where we can operate anywhere around the world under fair rules, but they can't operate here in that fashion. That's not -- whatever is being imagined as the alternative is not the alternative.\nThe alternative is what we have today -- a situation in which we don't have as many protections around labor and environmental issues as we’d like; a situation in which there are countries like Japan that sell a lot of goods here, but that keep pretty restricted access for U.S. companies and U.S. workers to their markets. And Prime Minister Lee is right that Prime Minister Abe of Japan, for example, has taken some significant risks because he knows that he needs to make his economy more competitive, and as a consequence is willing to open access that we haven’t seen in the past. And that's a big market, still one of the top three economies in the world.\nSo the last point I’d make around this is China. As Prime Minister Lee mentioned, China is not a part of TPP. But if we don't establish strong rules, norms for how trade and commerce are conducted in the Asia Pacific region, then China will. And China is already engaging all the countries in the region around its own version of trade agreements. And they're sure not worried about labor standards, or environmental standards, or human trafficking, or anti-corruption measures. So you get a low-standard, lowest common denominator trade deal -- and if America isn't creating high standards, then China’s rules will govern in the fastest-growing part of the world.\nThat's bad for us economically, but it's also bad for security interests. It's also bad for the interests in promoting norms against child labor, or against human trafficking, or making sure that everybody is working harder to raise conservation standards. And that's the alternative. That's the option. So I think it is very important for us to get this done.\nIn terms of assurances, nothing in life is certain, but we've got a pretty good track record of getting stuff done when I think it's important. And I will say this -- that this actually is not just a Obama administration initiative. This concept began in a Republican administration. We pushed it through. We made it happen. We made sure that the things that I care about in terms of labor and environmental standards were incorporated into it. But, historically, this has had strong bipartisan support.\nSo the bottom line is, we'll go out there and we're going to make those arguments, and ultimately I think we're going to be successful.\nIn terms of my rebalance legacy, across the board we are just in the game. We are focused on Asia in a way that we weren’t when I came into office. And the countries in Asia have noticed. Our alliances are stronger. Our security arrangements are deeper -- whether in Australia, or the Philippines, or Singapore. Our defense budgets reflect our commitment to things like maritime security in the region. The continuing efforts around building the East Asia Summit architecture means that there’s the kind of day-to-day interaction around a whole range of issues, whether it's disaster relief, or public health issues, or counterterrorism. There's consultations that are taking place today were not taking place eight years ago.\nSo I think on every dimension, we are in a much stronger position to engage, influence, and learn from our Asia Pacific partners.\nThe thing I probably enjoy most has been our Young Southeast Asian Leaders program, just because whenever I meet with the young people from ASEAN countries, I am inspired. It makes me very optimistic about the future and what’s going to happen over those next 50 years. Because if you ask them about the future that they want to see, they are very much committed to an interdependent world, a world in which people are learning and exchanging ideas, and engaged in scientific and educational exchange, and a world in which people’s different cultures and backgrounds are a source of strength and cooperation as opposed to conflict and fear.\nAnd that's true in Southeast Asia. That's true in Africa. That's true in Latin America. That's true in Europe. A lot of this fear -- the choice that was posed by Prime Minister Lee between interdependence and self-sufficiency that is not achievable, and ultimately rivalry and conflict -- those who opt for rivalry are folks who are looking backwards. You talk to young people around the world, they understand that interdependence is the way that we're going to assure peace and prosperity for all of us for years to come.\nAnd so that may be the thing that has some of the most lasting impact. I suspect in some of those town hall meetings I've had, there are some future prime ministers and presidents and business leaders and non-for-profit leaders that are going to do great things, and I'm glad to have been able to have played a small part in that.\nPRIME MINISTER LEE: Thank you. Thank you very much.\nEND\n12:17 P.M. EDT\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Vietnam is an authoritarian regime. The ruling Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) is committed to retaining its political monopoly in perpetuity and has, in recent years, worked to curtail and even eliminate open expressions of political dissent.\nIn January 2021, the CPV held its 13th congress and elected a new 200-member Central Committee and an 18-member politburo. Later in 2021, the country held a national election to elect the new National Assembly. Over the past two years, the country has endured political quakes relating to corruption and an anti-corruption campaign overseen by the party’s sitting general secretary, Nguyen Phu Trong. Several members of the Central Committee and the politburo have been arrested or forced to resign from their positions in association with two grand corruption cases. Notably, those dismissed included two deputy prime ministers and the state president, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who accepted “political responsibility” for his junior officials’ involvement in grand corruption cases. His replacement was Vo Van Thuong, who, born in 1972, is young relative to the typical age of Vietnam’s senior leaders.\nSince 2013, particularly from 2016 to the present, the anti-corruption campaign led by Trong, which has also, at times, contained elements of a political purge, has achieved remarkable results. Additionally, under his leadership, the CPV has intensified party discipline through a resolution aimed at rectifying the ethics and lifestyle of its party members. The resolution’s goal is to silence and, in some cases, provide a basis for expelling party members who make statements that are deemed “contradictory with the party’s lines and the state policies.” Given the practical difficulty of avoiding corrupt behavior, it is not entirely surprising that the anti-corruption drive has had a chilling effect on public investment and other projects, as state officials are cautious and increasingly risk-averse.\nBeyond the Communist Party of Vietnam’s (CPV) ability to maintain political stability through its dominance, the CPV’s performance on rights and other governance measures remains poor. Two cases of particular note concern the party’s discipline and expulsion of Chu Hao, a former vice minister of science and technology, and the steps the party has taken to restrict dissent online. Human rights activists viewed the expulsion of Chu Hao, a widely respected intellectual, as an attack on the freedom of speech. Furthermore, the adoption of a law on cybersecurity in 2020 is also seen as a further setback for freedom of speech and freedom of information. Civil society activists are often, and perhaps increasingly, harassed and strictly monitored by the public security force. Throughout 2022, a dozen activists in different fields, including those working on legislative and environmental affairs, were arrested.\nApart from corruption and human rights violations, other social issues of importance include inequality and environmental pollution. Gender inequality is on the rise, as evidenced by a very high rate of abortions – including a high number of sex-selective abortions – and an increasing gap between men’s and women’s pay. Despite Vietnam’s demonstrated commitment to the development of gender equity, the protection of women’s rights is limited. Social discrimination against people with disabilities was also a concern in the context of COVID-19. The income and wealth gap between the majority ethnic group (Kinh) and most ethnic minorities remains large.\nDespite a challenging global environment and continuing tensions between the United States and China, Vietnam’s economy has shown resilience. It has been supported by robust domestic demand, large-scale foreign investment, much of which is associated with the declining international attractiveness of China, increased export-oriented manufacturing and unprecedented growth of the private sector. Despite facing the impact of COVID-19, Vietnam’s growth rate was 2.91% in 2020, 2.58% in 2021 and 8.3% in 2022, making it one of the few countries that posted a positive economic growth rate during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVietnam’s prominence in the international arena has increased, in part due to the efforts of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). Within the region, Vietnam’s role and influence in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have continuously grown. Vietnam-China relations have improved since CPV Secretary-General Nguyen Phu Trong’s visit following the conclusion of the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) 20th party congress. Disagreements persist between the two countries regarding sovereignty in the South China Sea, particularly as Beijing continues to militarize its presence in the waters Vietnam claims. In 2020, Vietnam assumed the rotational chairmanship of ASEAN and began its second two-year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Additionally, Vietnam signed and joined bilateral and regional free trade agreements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. The country was also praised as a model in the fight against COVID-19. In 2022, Vietnamese leaders conducted official visits to various countries, and the prime minister attended the U.S.-ASEAN Summit at the White House.\nAfter two generations of war, the CPV’s successful efforts at defeating French and American forces, which culminated in 1975, were followed by the country’s political unification under communist rule. The extension of state-socialist economic institutions on a nationwide basis, in combination with the country’s international isolation and its wars with Cambodia and China, led to a comprehensive socioeconomic crisis that threatened the rule and legitimacy of the CPV. In 1986, the CPV formally adopted an economic reform program (known as Đổi Mới). These reforms paved the way for a somewhat market-oriented economy to develop and the nation’s deeper integration into the region and the world. Initial reform measures, such as the significant reduction of internal trade barriers and steps toward liberalizing foreign trade, remained largely ineffective due to galloping, triple-digit inflation rates. Desired results came only after the role of agricultural cooperatives was reduced, planned economy structures were abolished, prices for goods and services were allowed to float, and additional trade liberalization measures were implemented in 1988 and 1989. The number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) was sharply reduced from around 12,000 in 1990 to 1,963 in 2020. By the end of 2020, Vietnam had emerged as a new manufacturing and assembly powerhouse in the world. International trade and inflows of foreign direct investment – mainly into export-oriented manufacturing – have been the main drivers of economic growth. The government-engineered industrialization process included the establishment of Export Processing Zones (EPZ), which, due to cheap labor, attracted foreign investment to manufacturing. Despite signs of macroeconomic instability since, especially in 2011, Vietnam has had a rather steady economic growth rate of an average of 6% in recent decades. Its economy has proven its resilience during challenges to the global economy. In 2022, Vietnam had one of the highest economic growth rates in the world at 8.3%.\nThe private economic sector has increasingly been recognized as a key driver of the national economy, even though its role remains comparatively weak and lacks the vibrancy seen in private sectors in neighboring countries, including China. State-owned enterprises (SOEs), although fewer in number, still dominate and continue to receive benefits from the government through special bank loans and other policies. Privatization, which was only half-heartedly pursued during the assessment period under the banner of “equitization,” exposes firms to some competition while transferring assets to well-connected, regime-friendly segments of the population. In theory, having to compete with other firms for customers and market share could create pressure to stimulate efficiency and improve performance.\nIn comparison to economic reforms, political reforms have been minor. Efforts to “democratize” have mainly focused on improving the intraparty political process, decentralizing authority to the local (especially provincial) level and allowing for the appearance of popular participation in existing political institutions. However, since the mid-2000s, Vietnam has witnessed the emergence of a nascent civil society that, in one way or another, demands substantial political reforms and societal democratization. Nonetheless, civil society organizations have experienced a narrowing space for operations, as the government has adopted legal restrictions on their functioning. The CPV has made some progress in its campaign against large-scale corruption, but the absence of institutional reforms appears to limit those efforts. The recent expansion of the scope of duties of the Central Steering Committee for Anti-Corruption to cover negative practices, along with its nationwide founding at the provincial level, has contributed to further progress in the anti-corruption campaign. Additionally, recent developments in intraparty democratization and progress have enhanced the authoritative role of the National Assembly in the lawmaking process.\nIn the meantime, Vietnam has expanded and deepened bilateral relations with countries around the world, while normalizing and building stronger relations with its former foes, including China and the United States. In 1995, Vietnam achieved triple diplomatic success by joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), normalizing diplomatic relations with the United States and signing a framework cooperation agreement with the European Union (EU), which includes a human rights clause and covers economic and trade relations. As part of its accession to ASEAN, Vietnam also became a member of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). In 2007, it joined the largest global trade organization, the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 2018, the National Assembly ratified a multilateral trade agreement in the region known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). In August 2020, the free trade agreement (FTA) between Vietnam and the European Union went into effect. Later in the year, Vietnam joined 14 other Asian and Pacific countries to sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the largest regional economic pact. To date, Vietnam has established strategic partnerships with 15 countries and comprehensive partnerships with 17 countries. Vietnam has also signed free trade agreements with more than a dozen countries.\nSince Vietnam formally became a united country in 1976 under the rule of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), the CPV has successfully established the state’s monopoly on the use of force and faced no challenges from any active (armed) non-state actor. There have occasionally been protests by ethnic, religious or civil groups relating to land ownership in different regions of the country, but they were quickly and easily suppressed by the CPV and its forces. Last year, the CPV even consolidated its monopoly on power during the COVID-19 period when it punished anyone who breached the lockdown and restriction rules.\nMonopoly on the use of force\nIn the first decade of the CPV’s rule over a unified Vietnam, from 1976 to 1986, domestic challenges to the CPV’s legitimacy were principally due to the socioeconomic crisis caused by the poor performance of the country’s Soviet-style centrally planned economy and institutions. During this period, a small proportion of the population, especially those who were involved in the American-backed southern regime and some religious groups such as the Vietnam Unified Church of Buddhism, did not support the party-state. The state also faced some resistance to the government’s collectivization of agriculture and nationalization of industry, as well as the suppression of free commerce and political expression. The state’s limited legitimacy along with the prevailing hardship and suppression were push factors that caused large-scale migration, eventuating in the “boat people” phenomenon. The launch of reforms and impressive economic performance since the late 1980s enhanced the CPV’s subjective legitimacy. More recently, the CPV’s initial success in managing the COVID-19 pandemic further buttressed the party’s legitimacy but was subsequently weakened by major scandals that led to the resignation of the state president, foreign minister and deputy prime minister. The country’s quick post-COVID-19 economic recovery has also supported the party’s legitimacy. Though it is hard to gauge state identity, given the diversity of backgrounds of the ethnic minorities, there is a single and shared national identity.\nState identity\nVietnam is a secular state ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The party-state thus far has recognized 43 religious organizations affiliated with 16 religious traditions with more than 26.5 million followers, accounting for 27% of the total population. Of these 16 religious traditions, Buddhism is the major religion and attracts the most followers. In its pursuit of a modern and secular state model, the government has adopted a legal framework that formally recognizes the religious freedoms of its citizens. It does not ban party members or government officials from visiting religious establishments to practice. Religious groups that are unregistered with and not recognized by the government are prohibited from operating. In 2022, the United States placed Vietnam on its Special Watch List, due to alleged anti-religious freedoms. Vietnam rejected this allegation as unjustified and inaccurate.\nNo interference of religious dogmas\nThe country’s basic administration is divided into four levels consistently implemented across the country, namely: central, provincial, district, and commune. The state administration is able to provide basic public services throughout most parts of the country, though the quality of the bureaucracy varies between provinces and cities.\nAccording to the Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys, there are eight basic social services groups, including (1) housing and production land; (2) clean water and sanitation; (3) electricity; (4) schools; (5) health care establishments; (6) communal cultural houses; (7) transportation roads; and (8) legal advice and consultation. A report published by the World Bank in 2022 showed that, though improvements in public services have occurred, poverty rates are still much higher among rural and ethnic minority households primarily engaged in agriculture across the country than among urban, non-minority households. The former groups face the persistent challenges of low human capital, low-quality local public services, significant distance to economic opportunities and little access to financing and training. Basic water sources (96.9%), basic sanitation (89.2%) and electricity (100%) are widely accessible to most Vietnamese. However, poverty and location also affect access to basic water and sanitation. The access rate to water is 84%, 96% and 94% for the poorest, people in rural and people in regional areas, respectively, compared to 97% nationally and 99% in urban areas. Under 50% of the poorest segment of the population enjoys basic sanitation, and 19% of them have no access to sanitary latrines.\nThe World Bank Global Electrification Database projected that by 2020, 100% of the Vietnamese population would have access to electricity. This is thanks to the success of the country’s rural electrification programs over the years.\nBasic administration\nVietnam holds one-party elections every five years for both the National Assembly and local people’s councils across the nation. Formally, everyone is equal before the law and can run in elections after reaching the age of 18. However, a party-controlled national elections council scrutinizes and approves the final list of candidates. While voting is mandatory, turnout is cosmetic. Very often, a single family member casts votes for his or her entire family.\nFree and fair elections\nThe party adopts the principle of democratic centralism, meaning decisions are made by the politburo or the Central Committee. All heads of government ministries, ministerial agencies and provincial party committees must be members of the Central Committee. The power arrangement as such aims to ensure effective and consistent leadership of the party throughout the system from the central down to the grassroots level. According to the party’s constitution, the Central Committee is the decision-making body of the party, but in reality, the politburo is the most powerful institution, the membership of which varies from one term to the next. The politburo elected in 2021 had 18 members, but two of them, including the state president and one deputy prime minister, have been recently dismissed due to “political irresponsibility” in connection with some grand corruption cases. According to a new party rule, the list of candidates to be elected to the Central Committee will be approved by the politburo. The national party congress elects the members of the Central Committee, which then elects the general secretary, members of the politburo and the secretariat.\nEffective power to govern\nThere was no improvement in respecting the rights of freedom of association and assembly in the past year. The Vietnamese constitution adopted in 2013 affords citizens the right to freedom of association and assembly. However, the government continues to severely restrict the implementation of this right through sub-laws and regulations. In 2010, the government issued Decree No. 45 providing the establishment, activities and management of associations. The latest data from the government shows that, as of December 2022, Vietnam had 93,438 associations, an increase from 68,125 associations in 2017. Of these, 584 associations operate nationwide or inter-provincially and 92,854 associations operate locally. There are 124,889 grassroots trade unions nationwide, with a total number of 11,071,635 union members. The average percentage of union members out of total workers at agencies, organizations and businesses with trade unions is 93.1%.\nThese associations include five mass organizations under the direct management of the ruling party: the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, the Vietnam Farmers’ Union, the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union, the Vietnam Women’s Union and the Vietnam Veterans’ Association. A non-governmental organization can be established, but, in one way or another, it must be affiliated with a state-sponsored umbrella organization or association.\nThe party-controlled National Assembly continued to delay deliberations on a bill on associations the government had drafted. This is because the party fears the bill, once adopted into law, will allow for the emergence of independent non-governmental organizations and possibly opposition political parties. There is no confirmation yet as to when the bill will be submitted to the National Assembly for deliberation and enactment into law. Opposition political organizations of any form remain banned.\nBecause of the already strict regulation of civil liberties, additional constraints – other than the restrictions on freedom of travel and movement that come with lockdowns during the COVID-19 period – have not been necessary.\nPublic gatherings, especially those concerning “sensitive” topics such as human rights, democracy and civil society, permitted by the authorities are closely monitored by public security (police). In the past, several public gatherings and demonstrations were held to protest China’s aggressive actions in the East Sea (South China Sea). In the past year, a group involved in the clean-up of plastics was suppressed. Similar to the situation with the bill on associations, the enactment of a law on demonstrations is continuously delayed. Without a law on demonstrations, the government has applied arbitrarily criminal rules to suppress the assembly rights of the citizens. Some of the multinational or bilateral free trade agreements that Vietnam has joined and signed with other countries empower workers to strike or encourage the establishment of independent trade unions. Public gatherings and demonstrations without permission are still banned and dissolved.\nAssociation / assembly rights\nFreedom of expression is protected by the 2013 constitution. However, the Press Law, the Publication Law and the Criminal Code criminalize any activities that are considered “propagandizing against the state,” “conducting propaganda to slander the people’s government; conducting psychological warfare and spreading rumors; creating, storing and disseminating cultural products with anti-socialist government contents,” “taking advantage of democratic freedoms and rights to violate the interests of the state and social organizations,” “slandering and questioning the legitimacy of the people’s government,” and so on. The government often uses these vaguely defined crimes to restrict this freedom.\nUp until 2018, the internet appeared to provide a public space for citizens to express dissident political and social views in the context of a party-state where no independent media is allowed. Freedom of expression has been increasingly restricted since June 2018 when the National Assembly adopted the law on cybersecurity. The law went into effect on January 1, 2019. Facebook, which is easily the biggest platform, is subject to continuous, comprehensive monitoring by a team of internet monitors believed to number in the thousands. Internet users in Vietnam are now more cautious in posting their expressions online than they were just a few years ago. Internet users can be, and are, charged with various violations.\nFreedom of expression\nThe separation of three branches of power is constitutionally established but merely formal and symbolic. Hence, the state’s rhetoric that “the party leads, the state manages and the people are the masters of the country.”\nThe National Congress of the CPV is held every five years. There, directions for development and plans, including foreign policy, for the next five years are adopted. Congress selects a Central Committee, which is the most powerful decision-making body of the party. The CPV’s 13th congress, which was held in early 2021, elected a Central Committee of 180 official members and 20 alternate members, who then appointed a politburo of 18 members and a secretariat of seven members. Actual power rests with the 18-member politburo, which includes the four most powerful positions, popularly known as the “four pillars,” namely the CPV secretary-general, the state president, the prime minister and the chairman of the National Assembly. The CPV secretary-general is the most powerful man (the CPV has never selected a woman) in the country. The idea that the general secretary lacks formal executive power is an illusion. In practice, the general secretary wields considerable power, even though that power can vary from one quinquennium to the next. The other three top positions are the state president, the prime minister and the chairperson of the National Assembly. In the past year, the state president, two deputy prime ministers and several high-ranking officials were pressured to resign from the Central Committee due to violations of their political responsibilities and the wrongdoings of their underlings and their family members in relation to several grand corruption cases. The party subsequently filled these vacancies by appointing replacements.\nAt all levels of state and in all administration organizations, there exists a party committee whose function is to oversee routine operations and control all important affairs, including, for example, the personnel and structure of the organization. The head of the executive branch is also the chairman of the party committee. For instance, a minister is also the chief secretary of the ministry’s party committee.\nSeparation of powers\nThe justice system is under full control of the CPV. Chief justices and judges are party members and bound by the decisions made by party committees. The chief justice of the People’s Supreme Court (PSC) and the minister of public security are currently members of the politburo, while the chief of the People’s Supreme Procuracy is a member of the Central Committee. The chief justice and chief prosecutor are appointed by the state president, and the appointments are approved by the National Assembly. The selection and nomination of judges and procurators at all levels are screened and verified by the party committees where they are employed.\nOne of the judiciary’s mandates is to conduct trials of corruption cases, which are normally related to former and incumbent high-ranking government officials and party members, including members of the politburo and Central Committee. However, the CVP has always directed courts to limit the scope of the trials in these cases, effectively protecting the regime, as some grand corruption cases are likely to implicate high-ranking and even top government leaders.\nIndependent judiciary\nWhile corruption and other abuses of power remain prevalent, the heightened scrutiny accorded to corruption, particularly since 2021, has caused people in the state apparatus to adopt a cautious approach and sophisticated methods to avoid and evade detection. After being elected for an extraordinary third term in office as CPV secretary-general and chairman of the Central Anti-Corruption Steering Committee in 2021, Nguyen Phu Trong intensified the fight against corruption. In 2022, under Trong’s leadership, the committee expanded its mandates to cover so-called “negative practices.” Subsequently, the committee was renamed the “Central Anti-Corruption and Negative Practices Steering Committee (CNSC).” The CPV Central Committee adopted a resolution to allow the CNSC to operate at the provincial level. All provinces and cities under the central authority have put in place their own CNSC. The scope of “negative practices” includes abuse of office power for any purpose linked with corruption.\nIn 2022, two major corruption cases drew international attention: the Viet A COVID-19 test kits and repatriation flights for Vietnamese stranded overseas. These cases were typically linked to office abuse. As a consequence, dozens of government officials, including the minister of health, the chairperson of the Hanoi Municipal People’s Committee, a provincial party secretary, deputy ministers, directors of departments and others were arrested and expelled from the party. More notably, the state president and two deputy prime ministers were forced to resign from their posts because of their “political responsibility” to the “party and the people” since these events took place under their watch. The resignation of the state president and the dismissal of two deputy prime ministers seem to reveal the CPV’s and, more specifically, Nguyen Phu Trong’s determination to prevent and prosecute abuse of office.\nProsecution of office abuse\nAccording to the 2013 constitution, “human rights and citizens’ rights are recognized, respected and protected” by law, but citizens are bound by their duties to the state and society. In reality, violations of civil rights are common. These include harassment, torture, cruel treatment, arbitrary arrest and detention, denial of fair public trials, infringement on privacy and the correspondence of activists and members of civil society organizations. The recent adoption of the law on cybersecurity enhances the authorities’ ability to monitor free expression via social media.\nFurthermore, citizens’ enjoyment of their rights is subject to evaluation according to principles of “national defense, national security, social order and security, social morality and community well-being.” The party-state and its security machinery often use these concepts as a pretext to silence voices or suppress activities deemed to challenge the power and legitimacy of the ruling party and the survival of the regime. Security forces are often deployed to suppress activities that the government defines as posing a threat to social order and security.\nFreedom to practice one’s religion continues to be subject to constraint. Especially members of the Evangelical Church of Christ, and in the Northwest Highlands, H’mong Christians, the Evangelical Church of Vietnam North, the United Buddhist Church, some Cao Dai, Hoa Hao Buddhist groups and many Catholic priests have been harassed and arrested because of their religious practices, or on charges of undermining the unity policy of the party-state. Overall, the party-state effectively controls religious activities and does not accept the influence of religious dogmas on law order and political institutions. In 2022, the U.S. Department of State named Vietnam a country requiring special attention to religious freedom. Despite certain progress, women, children and other vulnerable groups face a situation in which formal rights and protections are easily ignored or insufficiently enforced. In such an environment, protection from domestic abuse remains limited.\nCivil rights\nAccording to the 2013 constitution and CPV statutes, the CPV leads all aspects of society. Existing representative institutions are controlled and “placed under the leadership of the party.” The National Assembly is the party-state’s lawmaking body. It has nearly 500 members, but more than 90% of them are party members who are bound to party rules and orders.\nIn recent years, the party has reformed the National Assembly’s operations to make it a more deliberative forum. This is seen, for example, in periodic question and answer (Q&A) sessions broadcast on live television and in the holding of confidence votes, during which the assembly assesses the performance of elected and appointed positions, including the president, the prime minister, the chairperson of the National Assembly and government ministers. The Q&A sessions are organized in terms of sectoral issues and predetermined topics. However, direct debates between the deputies and the ministers have been allowed.\nThe CPV has established measures to promote “grassroots democracy” at the local level following province-wide riots by farmers in Thai Binh province in 1997. In 2022, the National Assembly adopted the Law on Grassroots Democracy, replacing the 2008 Ordinance on Grassroots Democracy. However, the law will not go into effect until July 2023. The law enhances the mandatory implementation of nominally democratic accountability mechanisms such as people’s inspection boards, which serve as a community’s investment monitoring boards at the lowest administrative level, including at the village level. It buttresses local residents’ participation in public projects, transparency, as well as the accountability of local officials for their performance. The law’s effectiveness remains to be seen, but the execution of its predecessor was generally evaluated as “cosmetic,” “formalist”‘ and “not real.”\nPerformance of democratic institutions\nThe Communist Party of Vietnam does not allow any opposition parties to exist. As of December 2022, there were 51,827 party committees with more than 5.3 million members across the country, accounting for approximately two percent (2%) of the country’s population. Party committees are in all public offices and state-owned enterprises. Private business owners can be admitted to the CPV.\nCommitment to democratic institutions\nThe Communist Party of Vietnam does not allow any opposition parties. As of December 2022, there were 51,827 party committees with more than 5.3 million members across the country, accounting for approximately two percent (2%) of the country’s population. Party committees are available in all public offices and state-owned enterprises. Private business owners can be admitted to the CPV.\nWith continuously high economic growth since the launch of Đổi Mới, helping the CPV survive the socioeconomic crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s, as well as the ongoing anti-corruption achievements of the past decade, the CPV has buttressed its “performance legitimacy,” even as its image as a revolutionary force for justice has faded. The party-state’s success in containing the COVID-19 pandemic and early reopening the borders to aid economic recovery also earned more support for the party and its rule. However, corruption cases relating to the fight against COVID-19 and the resignation of the state president and two deputy prime ministers have also negatively impacted the party’s rule and reputation.\nParty system\nWith respect to formal interest groups, there are five mass organizations, namely the Vietnam Fatherland Front (VFF), Vietnam Women’s Union (VWU), Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL), Vietnam Farmers’ Union (VFU), Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union (HCYU) and the Vietnam Veterans’ Association (VVA). These organizations implement the party’s social and political agenda. Leaders of these mass organizations, except VVA, are more often than not members of the CPV Central Committee, holding a rank equal to a government minister. The president of VFF is currently a CPV secretariat member. All these organizations are organized according to the principles of democratic centralism.\nOther formal interest groups include professional organizations such as the Vietnam Lawyers’ Association and Vietnam Bar Federation, Vietnam Union of Science and Technology Associations (VUSTA) and Vietnam Union of Literature and Arts Associations, which are also influenced by the CPV. The Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) ostensibly represents the interests of the business community but, in reality, is a government agency managed by a party committee. The heads of these professional associations and organizations are party members and former high-ranking government officials.\nIn addition, there are thousands of smaller groups and associations established with the permission of the government. They are often affiliates of one of the “big name” organizations above. Most of these are financially autonomous; hence, their operations are for the sake of their members.\nInformal interest groups constitute associations of people from the same hometown, those who share kinship, former classmates, alumni, and so on. These groups are not formally established. Their existence enhances and maintains the cohesion of social relationships that, to some extent, contributes to the resilience of rather than posing a threat to the regime.\nInterest groups\nFor more than 10 years now, surveys have been conducted to measure governance at the local level across the country. These include the PAPI and PAR indices. They are carried out with the involvement of international consultants. Hence, to some extent, they are independent and objective. Local authorities very often look at these surveys to encourage reforms in local governance. Some government, party and parliamentary institutions, such as the Central Commission for Education and Propaganda (CCEP), Institute of Sociology and National Assembly Committee for Social and Cultural Affairs, also occasionally conduct public surveys, but with limited scope. The CCEP established the Institute for the Study of Public Opinions, which regularly conducts surveys to collect public opinions on specific topics but not on the regime or the party. The results of these surveys are not normally published. However, researchers can manage to access the results, which are most likely biased, one way or another.\nThe official state position and those of independent activists reflect contradictory views of democracy. While state media boasts about the regime as a people’s democracy, activists reject that as rhetoric. Unfortunately, the activists’ views can only be seen on social media, not in the state-controlled media. Views about democracy within the state vary but cannot be ascertained, as research on this matter is impossible.\nApproval of democracy\nWhile there is scarce data on social capital in Vietnam, available quantitative indicators include interpersonal and institutional trust, public participation, associational networks, acceptance of social inclusion and diversity. Prevailing practices, such as the arbitrary use of public power and corruption, indicate that social capital plays a prominent and sometimes negative role in the political system.\nIn Vietnam, indicators except for public participation, especially in the field of politics, are well-established. Trust and cooperation in everyday social life reflect broad societal norms of what is considered to be appropriate. For instance, self-help and mutual support are cultural traditions in Vietnamese society. A folk slogan, “the full leaf supports the torn one” (lá lành đùm lá rách), is the heart of mutual support. Furthermore, the culture of village life is also a source of social capital that strengthens social cohesion and maintains social stability.\nVietnam’s successes in the fight against COVID-19 in the past two years are partly attributable to public trust in the government’s swift and authoritative measures. There is a consensus among scholars that voluntary compliance with crucial health measures (social distancing and masks) and self-help and solidarity among citizens (especially for those in need) were crucial aspects of societal resilience during the COVID-19 crisis in Vietnam. Citizens’ cooperation with the government is a remarkable source of social capital and a key to the success of efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, the pandemic (and citizens’ responses to it) reveals some new insights into the state of solidarity, trust and social capital in Vietnam, suggesting a less critical situation than previously thought.\nSocial capital\nVietnam is well on its way to recovering from COVID-19. However, there are many social issues that need to be addressed as a result of the pandemic. Since the third quarter of 2021 and throughout 2022, Vietnam’s economy has experienced a strong rebound and witnessed robust growth. This can be attributed to the successful containment of COVID-19, the early reopening of borders, the country’s enduring competitive advantages and the favorable effects of international capital flight from China. In 2022, Vietnam recorded an economic growth rate of 8.02%, making it one of the fastest-developing economies in the post-COVID-19 period. The rebound was largely supported by the dynamism of the private sector.\nVietnam’s growth in the past decade has been generally inclusive. A significant portion of the population has successfully lifted themselves out of extreme poverty. According to the World Bank’s lower middle-income country (LMIC) poverty line ($3.20/day 2011 PPP), Vietnam’s poverty ratio decreased from 16.8% in 2010 to 5% ($3.65 a day at 2017 PPP) in 2020. This translates to 10 million people escaping poverty, resulting in a decrease in the number of the poor to five million in 2020. As of 2021, the country has an HDI score of 0.703.\nDespite these impressive poverty reduction outcomes, large shares of the population remain vulnerable and inequality has likely increased. Official government and World Bank data on inequality needs to be qualified, given its inability to account for hidden poverty, hidden high incomes and hidden wealth. Data shows that consumption among affluent households grew at faster rates than among poor ones in the last decade, resulting in increasing inequality.\nSocioeconomic barriers\nVietnam’s economy is socialist-oriented but increasingly market-based. With high levels of inward FDI, rising exports and open formal policies, Vietnam’s economy is considered one of the most globalized in the world. It is now a member of free trade pacts like the CPTPP and RCEP, which include major economies.\nHowever, given the influence of socialist ideology and, more importantly, favoritism toward state-linked firms, the country’s economy still faces competitiveness constraints. The government frequently claims that all enterprises are equal regardless of ownership, whereas, in reality, the state-owned sector is heavily favored and given more access to national and natural resources than private firms. The state’s monopoly extends to all strategic commodities, including oil and gas, electricity, and telecommunications. Although partial privatization of these services is permitted, it is only allowed for business people and networks tied to the party-state.\nIn 2021, the government issued Decree No. 31, prescribing 84 trades and sectors, including journalism, fishing, security services and others, that are not freely open to foreign investors. In addition, foreign employees in Vietnam still face employment constraints due to cumbersome work permit administrative procedures.\nAll foreign exchange payment transactions and remittances occur without encumbrances. However, transactions on the Vietnamese market may not be denominated in foreign currencies, except for certain cases as per State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) regulations. Credit institutions, foreign bank branches and other organizations are allowed to provide foreign exchange services on the international and domestic markets with the approval of the SBV.\nPrivate enterprises continue to face challenges resulting from the government’s policies and laws, despite their growing significance in the economy. Administrative procedures are burdensome, fostering conditions conducive to corruption and bribery. Furthermore, disparities exist among the laws governing investment, land, procurement and other areas, impeding the investment opportunities of private enterprises and effectively creating an unequal playing field between private and state-owned enterprises.\nThe government has made a more sustained effort to “privatize” many state-owned enterprises since 2010. However, SOEs continue to receive far more favorable access to land and credits from the government than Vietnam’s private enterprises, especially those whose directors lack political connections. The latter face onerous regulations, unfavorable government policies and much more powerful competitors in state-owned enterprises with foreign stakeholders.\nMarket organization\nThe Competition Law, which went into effect on July 1, 2019, is the legal document governing all commercial and market competition in the country. In March 2020, the government issued an executive decree (No. 35/2020/ND-CP) providing guidelines for its implementation. Technically, all economic sectors have equal access to natural resources and state support. However, the socialist-oriented economy principle allows state-owned enterprises to have overriding authority in areas that preserve the regime.\nAccording to the Competition Law, agreements that restrain competition, market dominance, economic concentration and unfair practices will be addressed. The law has also expanded its scope to include both Vietnamese and foreign companies and individuals if their actions have restricted or could potentially restrict the domestic market. For the first time, the law states that the Vietnamese government will have authority over offshore activities if they impact the domestic market.\nThe law applies to foreign entities involved in competition-restricting agreements, economic concentration or other unfair activities, even if they do not have a subsidiary in Vietnam. Additionally, public service units such as hospitals and schools are now subject to the law, which was not the case in the previous version.\nThe National Competition Committee (NCC), which operates under the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT), is responsible for overseeing three areas of state management: competition management, consumer protection and multi-layer trade. The chairperson of the NCC is appointed by the prime minister, based on recommendations from MIT. According to the Competition Law, certain types of anti-competitive agreements are prohibited if the firms involved operate in the same market or if the agreements have the potential to impact market competitiveness. To encourage cooperation, the Competition Law includes a leniency program. As a result, companies that are part of an anti-competitive agreement may qualify for leniency if they proactively contact government authorities before a formal investigation is launched. However, this program is limited to the first three applicants. The initial applicant is eligible for a full exemption from penalties, while the second and third applicants are eligible for exemptions of 60% and 40%, respectively.\nCompetition policy\nVietnam has signed 15 multilateral and bilateral free trade agreements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Vietnam-UK Free Trade Agreement. In August 2020, the Vietnam-European Union Free Trade Agreement went into effect, benefiting Vietnamese exports to the European Union market. Vietnam is also a founding member of the Comprehensive Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), from which the United States withdrew during the Trump administration.\nIn 2022, Vietnam’s foreign trade exceeded $730 billion. In 2021, Vietnam was the 23rd largest exporter and 20th largest importer in the world. Within ASEAN, Vietnam was the second-largest exporter and importer, just behind Singapore.\nAt the 13th congress in 2021, the CPV adopted two centenary goals. The first one is to transform Vietnam into a high-middle-income country by 2030 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPV. The second is to make Vietnam a developed industrial nation by 2045, on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. To achieve these goals, foreign trade has a key role to play as a strategy to integrate Vietnam into the world economy and the international community.\nLiberalization of foreign trade\nThe state plays the dominant role in the banking system. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) is not independent. This leaves the banking system open to political manipulation by politicians and corruption. The banking system consists of four state-owned commercial banks, 31 joint-stock commercial banks, nine foreign-owned banks, two joint-venture banks, 16 finance companies, 10 leasing companies and four microfinance organizations.\nDuring the 2000s, Vietnam experienced a significant increase in the number of private banks and the establishment of connections between tycoons in the banking sector and politicians. Mismanagement, corruption and vested interests threatened to cause a collapse of the banking system and resulted in substantial financial losses for the state. To address these issues, the state had to intervene by acquiring several private banks that owed debts to the state, often at no cost.\nAccording to regulations, banks must maintain a minimum charter capital of approximately $140 million. Nearly 60% of the joint-stock commercial banks have low charter capital (less than $150 million). The state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are not part of the banking system, but they represent a soft budget constraint that poses a tremendous risk to that system. During the credit and housing boom in the mid-2000s, SOEs took out large loans from state-owned banks, not for productive purposes but for real estate speculation. This resulted in a significant amount of nonperforming loans when the boom went bust in the late 2000s – SOEs are estimated to account for nearly 60% of those loans. By the end of 2019, a large number of SOEs faced business losses and owned non-refundable loans worth millions of dollars. Vietnam’s nonperforming loan ratio was 2.1% in September 2020, compared to the lowest record to date of 1.6% in December 2019. Although the official estimate of those loans is about 5% of GDP, Moody’s offers a much higher estimate of 15%. In 2020, the State Bank of Vietnam had to reduce interest rates three times, with the lowest rate at 1.5% to 2%, in response to the impact of COVID-19 on enterprises.\nIn 2022, the Vietnamese banking sector continued to recover from the impact of COVID-19. Although risks and uncertainty remain, impressive achievements in the banking sector in the past year include a strong recovery of credit growth, the return of idle capital to the banking system, a decline in nonperforming loan ratios, fee and commission income emerging as a stable source of income for commercial banks with a significant contribution of income from the insurance business and digital transformations as the backbone of most local banks’ long-term strategies.\nBanking system\nThe State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) is responsible for curbing and maintaining inflation at a sustained low rate, as well as stabilizing the financial market and foreign exchange market. However, the SBV functions more as a ministerial agency under the government than an independent central bank. In 2020, the inflation rate was 3.2%, followed by 1.83% in 2021 and 3.15% in 2022. Projections suggest that Vietnam’s inflation rate will reach approximately 4% in 2023.\nVietnam’s currency, the dong, is not convertible. Until recently, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) pegged the dong against the U.S. dollar, allowing it to adjust within a narrow band. Since 2012, the SBV has adopted a more flexible foreign exchange rate policy. Since early 2016, the SBV has applied a centralized exchange-rate administration policy. This approach has allowed the SBV to publish and adjust the exchange rate on a daily basis, setting the exchange rate baseline for credit funds and organizations to transact between the dong and the U.S. dollar within the margin of +/- 3%.\nIn 2022, the SBV had to make several adjustments to monetary policy to ensure that funds and loans were available for businesses to access and restore their operations after combating the impacts of COVID-19 over the previous two years. This enabled banks to provide funds to businesses, individuals and the overall economy. The high credit growth rate set by the SBV in the first half of 2022 caused smaller banks, in particular, to exceed the credit growth quotas the SBV had granted, leading to their inability to continue lending so as to meet the capital needs of firms and individuals. At times, several banks had to halt the acceptance of new loan applications because they had already utilized their entire granted credit growth quota. Vietnamese enterprises have long faced difficulties in accessing capital, but the situation has become even more dire in the past 12 months. Raising the credit growth cap before the Lunar New Year, when businesses were in desperate need of capital to fulfill their production and business plans, was a timely, positive decision that aided businesses and the economy overall in achieving their 2022 development target.\nIn 2021, Vietnam’s gross foreign exchange reserve amounted to nearly $100 billion, equivalent to about four to four and a half months of imports. However, by October 2022, the amount was $84.1 billion, which was equivalent to 3.0 months of imports. The reserve’s money supply increased $543.1 billion year-on-year in September 2022, and domestic credit reached $500.4 billion, representing an increase of 13.2% year-on-year. Vietnam’s nonperforming loan ratio was 1.8% in September 2022, an increase of 0.3% compared with the same period in 2021. However, risk assessments by the SBV and international financial institutions show that the country’s debt is still in the “safety” zone. It is expected that the SBV will continue to tighten monetary policy in 2023 to cope with the continued global recession due to the repercussions of COVID-19 and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.\nMonetary stability\nIn 2020, despite being impacted by COVID-19, the budget deficit was lower than expected, at 4.99% – equivalent to nearly $2 billion. However, in 2022, thanks to a speedy recovery of the economy, gross state revenue increased by approximately 15% compared to 2021, reaching $77.6 billion. According to the Ministry of Finance, the government’s debt repayment amounted to approximately $14.6 billion, with the government’s direct debt payment totaling a maximum of $13 billion and the repayment of on-lending projects at $1.56 billion.\nOver the past decade, the government has implemented several measures to control spending, such as streamlining the bureaucracy and reducing wasteful investment projects, but these efforts were stymied by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the government had to allocate a significant sum of money for social welfare assistance to businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. According to a government report, from 2020 to 2022, more than 100 trillion Vietnamese dong (equivalent to $4 billion) were expended on social welfare.\nThe government’s flexible and responsive fiscal policy to support local business communities has been praised. There is sound coordination between fiscal and monetary policies. The Ministry of Finance implemented a state budget restructuring plan, which improved the entire economy’s resilience to the impacts of the pandemic. Additionally, the government commanded all government agencies to cut at least 70% of expenditures for conferences and travel bursaries. It executed a delay in increasing the basic salary for public employees and the armed forces as a way to share the budget burden with the government. The general assessment is that, while Vietnam continued to face substantial impacts from COVID-19 and a global economic recession in 2021/2022, Vietnam’s fiscal policy made a pivotal contribution to positive economic growth and macroeconomic stability. However, one challenge is the low ratio of spending for public investment at the local level. The government delegated authority to localities to take responsibility for public investment spending, but many local governments could not fulfill their targets. Last year, Ho Chi Minh City only achieved nearly 70% of its public investment spending target, slowing the growth momentum of the city, which has always been defined as the driving force of the country’s development.\nFiscal stability\nVietnam has not yet recognized private ownership of land property. According to Article 53 of the 2013 constitution, land and other resources are publicly owned and state-managed. This has been criticized by activists and is considered one of the causes of state-society conflicts. Article 54 of the constitution and Article 16 of the 2013 Land Law allow local governments to requisition land for a variety of purposes related to national security and socioeconomic development. The law gives considerable decision-making authority over land pricing, allocation and reclamation to local people’s committees and people’s councils, which, many assert, contribute to unfair business practices and corruption.\nWidespread complaints persist of inadequate or delayed compensation, officials’ corruption, and a general lack of transparency and due process in the government’s process of confiscating land and displacing citizens to make way for infrastructure projects. In 2022, according to a report by the government’s general inspectorate, complaints relating to land disputes accounted for 64.6% of the total number of complaints received and handled by this body. Indeed, numerous reports exist of clashes between local residents and authorities at land expropriation sites. Some coercive land seizures have resulted in violence and injuries to both state officials and villagers, as occurred in Dong Tam Commune (a suburb of Hanoi), Thua Thien Hue Province (a central province) and other locations across the country. In January 2020, a deadly clash transpired between Dong Tam villagers and Hanoi riot police, resulting in the fatalities of three police officers and an 80-year-old villager.\nProperty rights\nIn the post-Đổi Mới era, particularly since the 7th congress in 1991, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has formally recognized that the state economy, the collective economy and the private economy are the foundations of the national economy. Since then, numerous laws have been adopted to create a legal framework for the operation of the private sector. In 1999, the Law on Enterprises was promulgated, which provided for the authority of the state, the rights of investors and businesses, and particularly the right to freedom to conduct business. The law became a catalyst for a surge in newly registered enterprises. In 2014, the National Assembly passed a revised version of the 2005 Law on Enterprises , as a reminder of the importance of private enterprises in the national economy.\nThe private and informal sectors play an increasingly important role in the economy. According to World Bank data, there were an estimated 22.5 million smallholder farmers (43%) and 11 million non-agricultural laborers (21%) among the 52.6 million people in the labor force in 2014. Additionally, there were 7.4 million wage workers without work contracts (14%). These figures compare to 11.3 million wage workers with contracts (22%), including 1.4 million employed in state-owned enterprises (2.6%), two million in foreign-owned enterprises (3.8%), and 3.9 million in the domestic private sector (7.5%). According to the General Statistical Office, the number of people working in the private economic sector was 45.2 million in 2018. Since 2015, the private sector has also been the leading investor, accounting for 38.7% of total investments, while the investment capacity of the public sector dropped from 47.1% in 2005 to 38% in 2015. In 2018, private investment increased to 43%, in contrast with the continued decrease of public sector investments, down to 33.3%. However, political connections are also a barrier to the growth and development of private enterprises, particularly in terms of access to public financing and funds during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2020, approximately 34,000 enterprises stopped their operations, most of them small private enterprises, according to a report released by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). In 2022, more than 130,000 new enterprises were licensed to operate with a total registered capital of 1,483.7 billion Vietnamese dong (or about $4.3 billion). However, during the same period, more than 70,000 existing private enterprises terminated operations and were removed from the market due to the impact of COVID-19 and the global economic recession.\nPrivate enterprise\nAccording to the government’s work report in 2022, nearly 56 million citizens – more than half of the population – and over 730 thousand employers affected by COVID-19 received financial support from the government’s social security fund, with a total value of 87 trillion Vietnamese dong (or about $4 billion). Vietnam’s social security system has been notably responsive to public demand, thanks to the country’s sustained high economic growth.\nIn health care, public spending increased from 1.5% to 2.7% of GDP from 2000 to 2018 and is now higher than most of Vietnam’s neighbors. Ascertaining whether increased public spending has contributed to improved health outcomes requires analysis beyond the scope of this report.\nHealth insurance enrollment increased from 15% to 70% of the population over the same period. Currently, 91.01% of the population is covered by health insurance. The watchdog function of health insurance is important, as it represents one of the few checks on adverse incentives that affect the health sector. Corruption has been partly contained, but petty corruption persists in the health care system. Furthermore, the anti-corruption campaign has resulted in a slowdown in the procurement of medicines, equipment and materials, which has had negative consequences.\nThe health care system responded effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to saving millions of lives. However, the system was also rocked by a corruption case involving the health minister and over 100 individuals that shocked the public. The health minister was arrested and expelled from the ruling party. Vietnamese social insurance has begun to play an increasingly important and effective role in the monitoring of health insurance payments as a means to promote health system accountability and cost control.\nVietnam has a pension system that pays pensions to workers in the formal sector and to elderly individuals for their past contributions to the revolution. Beginning in 2021, the retirement age in Vietnam was gradually increased. Therefore, by 2028, the retirement age for male employees will be 62. By 2035, female employees will retire at the age of 60. Public spending on pensions is below the global average, yet social contributions to pensions by employees and employers are high as a percentage of total spending, ranking only below China and Malaysia in East Asia. Social pensions cover 1.3% of individuals aged 60 to 79 and 79% of those aged 80 or above. The benefit level is modest at under 10% of per capita income. Social assistance programs have been implemented since 2000, but public spending on these programs has remained low at about 0.69% of GDP from 2008 to 2013. Moreover, mismanagement and corruption over the past 10 years have further weakened the social security regime.\nSocial safety nets\nWomen face discrimination and are paid less than men, even for equal work. They also have less access to political office than men do. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the existing gender gap in the Vietnamese workplace, with women experiencing discrimination in terms of employment opportunities and working hours. A report by the International Labor Organization shows that, in 2020, women worked 0.8% more hours than in the same period in 2019, while men worked 0.6% more. According to the Vietnam Country Gender Equality Report released by U.N. Women in 2021, the gender wage gap for employees in the formal sector favors men by 13.7%. Vietnam’s General Statistics Office (GSO) estimates the gender earnings gap at 21.5% to 29.5% in urban areas and 35.2% in rural areas. There is structural discrimination, reflected in the fact that women work similar hours to men but are overrepresented in low-paid segments of the labor market and in part-time work.\nWhile women have been able to advance through increased access to waged work, the economy has “a gendered structure” and women face formal, social and cultural barriers to participating on a par with men. In 2018, women accounted for 26.5% of small and medium enterprise (SME) ownership, and women-owned SMEs employed a higher percentage of female workers in Vietnam than those owned by men (43.4% versus 36%). Currently, only 17% of the nation’s large companies are led by women. The proportion of female managers in foreign-owned firms was 34.1% in 2019. No data is available on women’s representation in senior management roles within state-owned enterprises.\nEthnic minorities, migrants and rural residents are much poorer and have more limited access to services than Kinh and urban residents. They are also de facto discriminated against in terms of access to high-quality education and, within the limits of the party-state, public office. Christians, who account for about 10% of the population, and children of former government officials of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) may face career and political barriers if employed in state institutions.\nVietnam passed the Law on People with Disabilities (PWD) in 2010 and joined the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2015. Even so, PWDs face challenges in accessing basic social services, including health care and education. Over half of children with disabilities have never attended school. In 2020, COVID-19 significantly affected the country’s economic production and business activities and likewise affected PWDs’ employment. However, due to the government’s successful containment of the pandemic, the impact on PWDs was less severe compared to that in other countries in the region.\nEqual opportunity\nOutput has grown nearly 7% per year over the past decade. In 2020, amid the highly deleterious impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam was one of a few countries registering positive growth. Indeed, it had the highest growth rate in the world at 2.91%. The economy proved resilient through 2021 and bounced back magnificently in 2022, with GDP growth at 2.6% in 2021 and 8.2% in 2022. Between 2002 and 2021, GDP per capita increased 3.6 times, reaching almost $3,700 in 2021. Poverty rates ($3.65 per day, 2017 PPP) declined from 14% in 2010 to 3.8% in 2020.\nThe agriculture sector has supported economic growth and ensured food security, with a growth rate of 2.5% to 3.5% per year over the past three decades. The sector contributed 14% of GDP and 38% of employment in 2020 while earning more than $48 billion in export revenues in 2021 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFDI has been a major driver of economic growth in the past two decades. In 2018, Vietnam attracted $35 billion in FDI, making it the most attractive destination in the region for foreign investors. However, in 2020, the figure was lower, at $28.5 billion. In 2022, Vietnam attracted even less FDI than in 2020. According to data released by the General Statistics Office (GSO) in December 2022, Vietnam attracted an estimated foreign investment of approximately $27.72 billion in 2022, down 11% compared to the previous year. The report further reveals that, in 2022, Vietnam licensed 2,036 new FDI projects with a total registered capital of nearly $12.45 billion. The decrease in FDI values and FDI projects could be attributed to the impact of COVID-19 and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.\nOver the years, the proportion of economic sectors has changed. Vietnam was traditionally an agrarian nation, but the agricultural sector is gradually being replaced by the services and manufacturing sectors. In 2020, services accounted for 41.63% of the economy, followed by the manufacturing and construction sector at 33.72%. Agriculture accounted for only 14.85%. In 2022, even though affected by COVID-19, Vietnam’s total import-export value exceeded $732 billion, up 10% from 2021. The export turnover reached $371.5 billion, up 10.5% from 2021. This is the first time Vietnam’s import-export turnover surpassed the milestone of $700 billion.\nOutput strength\nVietnam has a comprehensive policy and legal framework in place to address environmental challenges. Policy documents include the Vietnam Climate Change Strategy (CCS) and the Vietnam Green Growth Strategy (GGS), both of which were signed by the prime minister. The Communist Party also issued a resolution on climate change, and there is an Environmental Protection Law. In fact, the recently revised penal code even includes a separate section on “environmental crimes.”\nDuring COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow, Vietnam made a strong commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Prior to that, in November 2020, the National Assembly amended the 2014 environmental protection law. These amendments impose responsibilities on corporations through a “polluters pay” rule, as well as requirements to utilize the best available pollution control technology. Additionally, the amendments give local communities expanded roles in conservation and supervision.\nFurthermore, the law reclassifies certain types of waste as resources, which is an important step toward improving the recycling process.\nWhile public awareness of environmental concerns and the will to regulate environmental pollution are pronounced, the enforcement of regulations and the lack of adequate monitoring mechanisms remain significant problems. As a result, government agencies and local authorities often ignore regulations in the pursuit of economic development, rendering the framework toothless. In 2022, Vietnam faced criticism from international human rights communities for arresting and jailing well-known environmental activists. Reports from international organizations indicated that some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in environmental activities were even forced to close down. A prevailing sentiment among environmentalist communities in Vietnam is that it is the government’s responsibility to implement environmental policies and non-state NGOs should refrain from criticizing the government.\nThe inefficient execution of environmental policies without proper oversight from the non-state sector has resulted in significant repercussions. For example, almost 80% of the nation’s primary forests have been lost, although the rate of deforestation has decreased in recent years. The construction of hydroelectric dams in the northwestern and central regions has been a major cause of deforestation and environmental degradation. These dams are now recognized as significant contributors to the heightened occurrence of floods in central Vietnam during the monsoon season. In 2020, these floods claimed the lives of hundreds of individuals and inflicted extensive property damage.\nEnvironmental policy\nVietnam’s education and training system includes formal and non-formal education at four main levels: early childhood education (including nurseries and kindergarten), general education (including primary education, lower secondary education and upper-secondary education), vocational education and training (VET), and higher education. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has overall responsibility for the national education system – except for VET, for which responsibility was transferred to the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) on January 1, 2017. MOET’s main responsibilities include education policy, curricula for early childhood and general education, identifying learning outcomes for higher education, setting standards for textbooks and teaching materials, budget planning, and quality assurance.\nAccording to a recent report by the World Bank, Vietnam has performed well in providing quality general education to its population. Over the past 25 years, Vietnam has expanded education access, achieved universal primary education and increased enrollments in lower secondary, upper secondary and tertiary education. Vietnam’s success has been attributed to the government’s relatively high expenditure on education, a focus on equity, attracting and supporting qualified teachers, investment in preschool education, strategic use of assessments and implementing reforms based on evidence-based decision-making. Adjusted for learning, Vietnam’s population has an average of 10.2 years of schooling, second only to Singapore among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. In June 2018, the government issued Decree 86, replacing Decree 73 (2012), on foreign cooperation and investment activities in education and training in Vietnam at all levels, except for vocational education and training. Vietnam has also implemented a couple of major education reform programs supported by international donors, including the Renovation of General Education Project (2016 – 2021); the Secondary Education Sector Development Program, phase II (2017 – 2023); and the Enhancing Teacher Education Program (2016 – 2021).\nAs of 2019, approximately 1.7% of Vietnam’s population was enrolled in universities, totaling 1.67 million students. By contrast, about 1.3 million students, accounting for four percent of Malaysia’s population, and approximately two million students, representing 3.8% of South Korea’s population, were enrolled in universities that same year.\nIn the long run, Vietnam needs to enable the enrollment of approximately 3.8 million students in order to reach the level of upper-middle-income country enrollment. Similarly, Vietnam’s gross enrollment rate (GER) in tertiary education was significantly lower than that of South Korea, China and Malaysia, as well as the average GER for upper-middle-income countries. Lastly, Vietnam’s research output was below the average of East Asian countries. In 2019, Vietnam’s research output was comparable to that of the Philippines and Indonesia but fell well below the desired benchmarks set by Malaysia and China.\nEducation / R&D policy\nIn the decade following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the CPV faced numerous structural constraints to governance. The success of the Đổi Mới program launched in 1986 and high economic performance over the past three decades have enabled the CPV to significantly diminish these structural constraints. Compared to many other countries in Southeast and South Asia, in particular, structural constraints to governance in Vietnam are moderate.\nVietnam is favorably located in the most economically dynamic region in the world and is endowed with abundant natural resources and a young population. Continued economic development has also boosted infrastructure development. Transport, logistics, and networks have been improved to meet the requirements of internal connections between regions for economic development and the country’s deep integration and engagement with the outside world. Nonetheless, there are certain structural constraints that remain, including growing urban vs. rural disparities and an underdeveloped infrastructure, especially transport infrastructure. The health system at the central level is resilient against pandemics such as COVID-19, but at the local level, it is still vulnerable and ill-equipped to handle diseases. In addition, Vietnam is one of the countries in the world most severely affected by climate change and extreme weather events. While education levels are relatively high compared to many other countries at a similar (or lower) income level, the quality of education and the capacities of the educational system are deficient and perhaps insufficient for future economic development.\nStructural constraints\nThe traditions of civil society are very weak in Vietnam. The society has local traditions of village-based associations that make the country’s associational life vibrant with lots of festive activities around the year. However, the concept of civil society is not accepted or discussed in any formal documents, and the CPV severely controls associational life in the political sphere.\nForms of civic engagement, including autonomous noncommercial, nonpolitical and nonfamilial associations have increased, but public and even civic engagement remain tightly controlled and repressed. There is a very large NGO sector – both domestic and transnational – and non-governmental organizations play an important role in social and economic life. At the same time, such forms of CSOs can only operate in “nonpolitical” areas, with approval from the party-state and many are government-controlled or organized. In recent years, the space for civic engagement, especially in the domain of environmental protection, has narrowed. Various civil society activists have been arrested.\nCivil society traditions\nHistorically, the major cleavage has been political as a direct consequence of foreign occupation and the defeat of the Republic of Vietnam in the south. Though the country united in 1976, the war still engenders some bitterness, hatred and division among many Vietnamese. While it remains hard to know how deep this cleavage runs, there is a lingering sense of distrust and even resigned disdain for the CPV rule among some segments of the population.\nThere is always the potential for conflict between certain religious communities and the local authorities over land ownership and religious practices. Rising social inequality and popular resentment against government land management policies, infrastructure development and environmental protection may lead to social conflict in the future.\nConflict intensity\nThe CPV exercises full control over the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The party adopts the country’s development strategies at its national congresses, the last of which was held in 2021. These set out priorities to be achieved between the two congresses or for a certain period of time. Strategic planning units are established at each administrative level and in government agencies, contributing to the prioritization of strategic goals. Since 1991, the party has adopted three 10-year socioeconomic development strategies, including for the periods from 1991 to 2000, from 2001 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2020. According to the new strategy adopted at the 13th congress in 2021, Vietnam aspires to become a modern middle-income country at a high level by 2030 and a “developed country” by 2045.\nIn 2020, the government managed to achieve a positive growth rate through a “dual tasks” strategy – combating COVID-19 and economic development concurrently. Vietnam’s economic growth rate as of December 31, 2020 was 2.91%, making it one of a few economies posting a positive growth rate, with the highest growth rate among those. COVID-19 affected the country in all aspects in 2020, but not much in terms of its long-term strategic goals.\nPrioritization\nThe Vietnamese government has continuously undertaken administrative reforms by removing the barriers that stem from multiple layers of regulatory procedures. Even though government agencies have eliminated thousands of administrative procedures and business conditions, loosening formal restrictions on business operations, the government’s implementation of its policies may be hampered by institutional capacity and weaknesses in human resources. In the party-state structure, the government is accountable for the implementation of socioeconomic development strategies adopted at national party congresses. The prime minister heads a committee in charge of drafting these strategies.\nThe government consistently seeks to implement priorities in response to circumstances at home and abroad. However, various goals are not achievable, not only given COVID-19 but also because the goals are too ambitious and due to inefficient, ineffective implementation resulting from cumbersome bureaucracy. In 2022, the government combatted COVID-19 and other diseases, while speeding up the recovery of the economy. According to a work report delivered by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh at the year-end conference on January 3, 2023, the government achieved 14 out of the 15 targets set for the year. The one target not achieved was an increase in productivity.\nImplementation\nSince Đổi Mới, almost all Vietnamese prime ministers have established their own advisory body, whose principal duty is to provide policy advice on economic affairs to the prime minister. However, the current prime minister, Pham Minh Chinh, has discontinued the body. Without the advisory body, the prime minister has called numerous meetings with economic sectors and government agencies, in which policy recommendations and executive instructions were made. Additionally, he established working groups led by one of his deputies or the head of the economic sector to deal with barriers to policy execution and to garner information for policy development.\nThe ruling CPV also has a policy advisory body named the Central Council of Theoretical Studies, whose main duty is to give advice to the CPV Central Committee, politburo and secretariat on the political theories that form the foundation for the party to develop policies to rule the country. The council holds dialogues with foreign counterparts, mainly with Chinese, Laos, Cuban and other communist parties, to learn not just how to protect socialism but more broadly how the communist party can stay in power and attract membership, given that young people are more interested in pursuing the cult of capitalism. The council also implements research projects and undertakes study tours to Western countries to learn about governance, anti-corruption, policymaking and so on.\nBoth the government and the party are keen to learn about policies and consult industry experts. However, critics are rarely tolerated and advice is frequently ignored, especially recommendations deemed to threaten the power and the rule of the party or touch on unspecified politically sensitive matters. Furthermore, vested groups or interest groups that are close to the government and party leaders, in various cases, influence policymaking for their own sake.\nThe Vietnamese government has other working channels to garner advisory input from foreign experts on economic issues. Experts from Harvard Kennedy School have had policy dialogues with the Vietnamese government over the past three decades and provided advisory notes and recommendations to the government for improving the business and macroeconomic environments.\nPolicy learning\nDespite piecemeal reforms, Vietnam retains an unwieldy administrative system constructed on the basis of a parallel state/party structure. In 2022, all government departments continued to streamline their administrative structures and reduce the number of regular personnel in line with an order of the CPV politburo in 2017. In 2018, seven directorates, 202 departments, and more than 14,800 divisions or equivalents were dissolved or merged, thus reducing the number of executives, including 11 at the directorate, 180 at the department, and 900 at the division level. At the local level, 65 departments or equivalents and 5,120 divisions or equivalents were reduced or merged, effectively reducing a massive number of local executives, including more than 170 at the department and approximately 8,350 at the division level. Within one year, more than 59,700 local bureaucrats were made redundant. In 2019, some provinces merged the Office of the Delegation of National Assembly Deputies with the Office of the People’s Council. In 2022, nearly 80,000 personnel were laid off from the central and local governments. Despite the government’s call for waste prevention, the use of public assets continued to be ineffective. Competitive recruiting procedures have been encouraged and piloted but are rarely used. Independent auditing mechanisms still fell short, and budgeting transparency has not been achieved. At times, restrictions on staffing levels have been excessively rigid or have harmed such sectors as education, where staffing shortages in some areas remain a serious problem.\nEfficient use of assets\nVietnam’s continued success in containing the spread of COVID-19 in 2022 and minimizing the death toll related to the pandemic constitutes a high point of policy coordination among government agencies. At the early stage of the outbreak of the pandemic, a National Steering Committee for the Prevention of Coronavirus, whose members were from different government ministries, including the Ministries of National Defense, Public Security, Foreign Affairs, Health Finance, Planning, and Investment and Education, as well as from the Office of the Government, Office of the Central Committee, was established to act as the focal point for combating the pandemic. At the outset, the committee was headed by a deputy prime minister and coordinated by the Ministry of Health. The deputy prime minister was then replaced by the prime minister, who took over the job to “ensure a consistent and united direction of the government” in the fight against COVID-19. All committee decisions have been made in a transparent manner and effectively coordinated.\nHowever, things did not always run smoothly in combating COVID-19, despite visible improvements and efforts to enhance policy coordination among agencies. Frequent agreements were signed between the government and the Vietnam Fatherland Front, a party-controlled mass organization, or among government agencies to enhance policy coordination and cooperation. Policies are developed by relevant ministries, which often suggest regulations that favor their sectoral management and administration, leading to a high level of policy incoherence. Coordination among government departments in policy development is inconsistent and lax. Policies relating to national security and defense are rarely verified. The Ministries of Public Security and Defense have exceptional power in the state. It is quite common that the implementation of public policies remains ineffective due to fragmentation among authorities and system decentralization. The head of a line department in a provincial government is accountable to not only the provincial chief but also the provincial party committee and the line ministry in his area of activity. Provincial government leaders are subordinate to the prime minister in the state hierarchy but also have to follow orders from provincial party leaders, who have quasi-equal status with the prime minister as members of the Central Committee.\nBy the end of 2022, the increasingly intensive anti-corruption drive began to have its deleterious impacts, as many state agencies at all levels became extremely and sometimes overly cautious about undertaking large-scale projects or procurement, to a point where this adversely affected the state’s ability to meet extremely urgent demands, such as investments in critical infrastructure (e.g., the north-south power grid) and various other projects.\nPolicy coordination\nThe CPV’s anti-corruption campaign continued to achieve positive results and entered a new phase in 2022. Established in 2013, the Central Steering Anti-Corruption Committee (CSCAC), chaired by the CPV Secretary-General Nguyen Phu Trong, was renamed the Central Steering Committee for Corruption and Negative Practices Prevention (CSCCNP). The CSCCNP model was established at the provincial level throughout the nation to create a united front from the central to local level in fighting corruption.\nThe national anti-corruption campaign was further intensified in 2016 after Nguyen Phu Trong was elected to a second term as the CPV secretary-general. In addition to the Anti-Corruption Law and relevant regulations that the government passed to strengthen its anti-corruption efforts in the public sector, there are also legal documents to prevent graft in private enterprises, particularly those operating in the financial, banking and credit domains. Yet, there are still no independent auditing mechanisms. There is little transparency in budgeting and public procurement. Moreover, as in other “party-states” in Asia (and elsewhere), the fusion of party and state interests and the instrumentalization of anti-corruption measures in political interests and factional power struggles weaken the effectiveness of notable anti-corruption efforts.\nIn 2022, two of the highest-profile cases relating to corruption and bribery drew attention not only among the country’s population but also abroad. These were the COVID-19 test kits, the manufacturing of which Viet A Company manipulated, and repatriation flights to bring home Vietnamese stranded overseas. More than 100 individuals, including the minister of health and the chairman of the Hanoi Municipal People’s Committee, were arrested and disciplined in the Viet A case, and more than 40 individuals, mostly from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were arrested and disciplined. Significantly, the state president and two deputy prime ministers were relieved of their positions to take “political responsibility” for these two grand corruption cases.\nNonetheless, the anti-corruption policy remains extremely limited because restrictions on the press and checks on the free flow of information deprive Vietnam of important tools for battling corruption.\nAnti-corruption policy\nVietnam remains a single-party state under the absolute rule of the CPV. While, in principle, it promotes inner-party democracy, the party rejects liberal democracy and effectively rejects party pluralism. In practice, the claim that there is substantive democracy within the party is false. Instead, the central party organs maintain a monopoly on political power under the banner of “socialist democracy,” which, according to the CPV, is inclusive participation under the communist party’s exclusive leadership. CPV leaders have vowed never to give up pursuing the path to socialism or the principle of party dictatorship. Space for a functioning, independent civil society does not exist.\nAfter more than three decades of Đổi Mới, CPV leaders have become confident in their goal of pursuing a market economy by actively joining different multinational organizations and signing free trade agreements with more than a dozen partners around the world. Within the party-state hierarchy, actors may not necessarily agree on how to undertake economic reforms, but there is consensus that only high economic performance can increase the party’s legitimacy, keep it in power and consolidate its authority.\nConsensus on goals\nThere are three anti-democratic actor groups. The first one includes those who advocate for CPV’s continued monopoly of power. They are party members. The second group comprises members of civil society organizations and intellectual groups. These actors, on the one hand, call for implementing the principles of a multiparty system, but, on the other, ally themselves with the CPV in support of gradual regime transformation. Finally, the third group includes members of the business community, many of whom have close connections to the party. They support the party because they benefit from the political stability established by the current regime. Members of this group are often reluctant to advocate for change.\nIndividuals and groups advocating for democratization regardless of their background are generally defined as “anti-party and anti (socialist) regime.” They are subjected to criminal charges under the Penal Code. Party members and ex-government officials who vow to promote democracy are labeled as having become “decadent in [socialist] ideology, self-evolved and self-transformed.” They are marginalized from party activities, silenced, and expelled, as was the case of Chu Hao, a former vice minister of science and technology.\nAnti-democratic actors\nSince Vietnam embarked on the Đổi Mới policy, new conflicts have emerged in various social areas and forms, including in the economic, political and ideological, cultural, lifestyle, and ethnic areas. At the grassroots level, there are often social conflicts between citizens or between citizens and local authorities over mismanagement of land or corruption. High-profile authorities-citizen conflicts relating to land disputes in recent years occurred in Dong Tam, Duong Noi, Hung Yen, Hai Phong and Dong Nai. Often, conflicts arise due to a lack of transparency and inconsistent public policies. However, the central government has always attributed these conflicts to local authorities’ mismanagement and incorrect implementation of policies and laws adopted by the party and central government. It has created some mechanisms, including those established under the legal framework of grassroots democracy, that aim to manage conflicts to keep them from scaling up to the national level. Still, many former high-ranking government officials have pointed out that the conflicts indicate a failure in the party’s conflict management ability. The party has never admitted fault and occasionally ascribed problems to what it calls “hostile forces” outside the country, including political parties established by overseas Vietnamese that call for political reforms and democratization in Vietnam. Frequently, conflicts are “resolved” through extreme acts of repression, including violence or threats of violence, carried out either by state agencies or state-hired thugs.\nCleavage / conflict management\nThe CPV has not yet formally used the term “civil society” in policy documents. This poses difficulties for organizations that identify themselves as civil society organizations. Still, over the past three decades, over 10,000 non-government organizations (NGOs) have been established as occupational associations, federations, institutes or community-based groups that work on a wide range of social issues. Compared to the political environment before Đổi Mới, the space for these NGOs to be active has widened on the grounds of an incomplete but involved legal framework. Many NGOs work in policy advocacy, formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Sporadic demonstrations about China’s aggression in the South China Sea (or East Sea) and peasant protests are other examples of non-state forms of social organization that exert varying degrees of influence over the government’s policies and policy agenda.\nPublic participation in politics and decision-making processes remains negligible given that the government wants to control all aspects of society. The party-state maintains control over those organizations designed to represent civil society interests. For instance, CSOs that receive foreign support and are involved in activities relating to “politically sensitive” topics, such as legislation and legal issues, human rights, democracy and political reform, are legally required to seek approval from the prime minister.\nIn the last year, the space for even quasi-independent civil society activities has narrowed. The CPV’s political leadership has rejected civil society consultations and effectively excluded non-party-state representatives from the political process.\nPublic consultation\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Northern Vietnam, under the rule of the CPV, conducted class struggle campaigns and internal political purges that killed and imprisoned hundreds of thousands of innocent victims. However, a public apology to the victims has never been made.\nThe North-South civil war (1954 – 1975) left a deep wound in the nation. In 2004, the CPV adopted, for the first time, a public document known as Resolution 36 NQ/TW that extended the party-state’s policy to overseas Vietnamese, including those who were on the other side. The document generally calls for the unity of all Vietnamese and implicit reconciliation between the “victors”‘ and the “losers” in the war. As a gesture of reconciliation, in 2006, the government agreed for the military cemetery of the former southern regime to be re-opened, allowing relatives of the fallen soldiers to visit and tend to the graves of their loved ones. Former high-ranking government officials from the southern regime, living abroad, have been welcome to return to the country. Nevertheless, a former chairperson of the government’s Committee for Overseas Vietnamese Affairs recently acknowledged that after more than 40 years since the end of the war and 15 years since the CPV Resolution, the wounds remain raw. The government also has not adequately recognized the noble sacrifice of naval soldiers of the former southern government against the Chinese in 1974, defending the country’s sovereignty in the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. Many overseas Vietnamese who used to have connections with the former southern government do not intend to return to the country because of fear of arrest by the government.\nReconciliation\nSince 1993, Vietnam has attracted more than $80 billion in Official Development Aid (ODA) and concessional loans, making it one of the largest ODA beneficiaries in the world. The Vietnamese government has repeatedly affirmed the importance of ODA funds to socioeconomic development, considering them an integral part of any mid-term public investment plan.\nIn December 2021, with the aim of streamlining the management process and improving the efficiency of ODA and concessional loans, the government issued Decree 114/2021/ND-CP on the management and use of ODA and concessional loans from foreign donors, which took effect on December 16, 2021 and replaced Decree 56/2020/ND-CP.\nIn addition to state agencies and other organizations assigned with public investment duties via programs/projects funded by ODA or concessional loans, Decree 114 allows the committee managing state capital-invested enterprises to assist state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in accessing ODA and concessional loans.\nIn the past, the administrative apparatus allowed pervasive rent-seeking and corruption, including in foreign-funded projects. In the context of anti-corruption efforts, major ODA bottlenecks developed, and many in the ODA community expressed concerns about the difficulties they face in disbursing funds. Failure to address this problem threatens to undermine the viability of socioeconomic development plans in multiple sectors.\nEffective use of support\nVietnam has gained credibility in the international community. The government in general honors its commitments as a member party to myriad bilateral and multilateral agreements as well as international treaties in numerous fields, including but not limited to climate change, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, arms control, trade, and human rights. In 2019, Vietnam was elected again to the U.N. Security Council for the 2020/2021 term. This is the second time the country has been elected to this body. In 2020, Vietnam was the chair of ASEAN and began its first-year non-membership of the UNSC. Vietnam was hailed for successfully leading ASEAN through the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as making effective contributions to the work of the UNSC.\nSince 2014, Vietnam has also sent troops to join the United Nations’ peacekeeping forces in South Sudan and other parts of Africa. Vietnam also contributed $500,000 in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and sent rescue forces to Türkiye to support the country after the deadly earthquake in early 2023. These activities were hailed by the state media as demonstrating that Vietnam is a responsible world actor.\nIn 2019, the government drew a global spotlight on Vietnam when it hosted the second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi. A point of note is that the political leadership has managed to convince the United States to recognize and respect the legitimacy of its current political regime, implicitly enhancing the legitimacy of the CPV. However, the party-state has a terrible record of human rights violations. Its commitments to the human rights provisions of international treaties remain superficial. The government continues to arrest and imprison bloggers and facebookers who advocate for peaceful political reforms, with the result that the state is called the “enemy of the internet.”\nIn the fight against COVID-19, Vietnam gained much credibility for its success in containing the pandemic. The WHO heralded Vietnam as a good model in this respect. More importantly, Vietnam turned COVID-19 into an auspicious opportunity to enhance diplomatic relations with countries around the world. Its COVID-19 diplomacy has consolidated the country’s position in the region and the world.\nCredibility\nVietnam’s foreign policy since the formal adoption of Đổi Mới reforms in the late 1980s has prioritized maintaining friendly relations with neighboring countries and befriending all countries around the world. To date, Vietnam has established strategic partnerships with 15 countries and 17 comprehensive partnerships with 17 countries, and it maintains special relationships with Laos, Cambodia and Cuba. Hanoi has particularly enhanced bilateral relations with the member countries of ASEAN. Vietnam has concluded strategic partnerships with all ASEAN members except Brunei and Myanmar. Since joining the ASEAN in 1995, Vietnam’s role in this regional group has increased.\nVietnam’s successful chairmanship of ASEAN in 2020 during the pandemic gave it a leading role in the organization. Its contributions to building, rule-setting and consolidating the group’s unity, as well as expanding the group’s relations with non-regional countries, have been appreciated. Hanoi has actively and proactively participated in other regional political and economic mechanisms such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum (APEC), the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and, more recently, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Vietnam’s leadership not only sees the expansion of regional cooperation as an economic benefit but also as a way to enhance its regime’s legitimacy. As always, the CPV is in the difficult position of coping with pressures from an increasingly expansionist Beijing, while also maintaining its steadfast commitment to a rules-based regional order. Notably, Vietnam still has disputes in the South China Sea (or East Sea by its Vietnamese name) with China and three other Southeast Asian nations – Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. Recently, however, it signed agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines to jointly exploit resources in overlapping sovereign waters, strengthening cooperation between Vietnam and these countries.\nRegional cooperation\nAt the 13th Party Congress in 2021, the CPV outlined ambitious development goals for the next five years, 10 years and 25 years. By 2025, Vietnam aims to become a developing country with a modernized industry and an income that surpasses the low-middle level. By 2030, on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPV, Vietnam hopes to achieve the status of a developing country with a modern industry and a high-middle income. By 2045, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Democratic Republic of Vietnam (now the Socialist Republic of Vietnam), Vietnam aspires to transform itself into a developed country with a high income level. However, institutional reforms are progressing slowly. Several critical issues remain unaddressed, including: (1) the lack of clear hierarchy and assignment of roles and responsibilities for policy formulation and implementation in both central government agencies and between the central and local governments, resulting in overlapping mandates with conflicting rules and decisions; (2) the absence of merit-based management of public servants, which negatively affects the quality of public administration; (3) a discrepancy between rhetoric and practice regarding citizens’ ability to observe, participate and influence political decision-making processes; (4) elections and electoral mechanisms that do not allow for genuine citizen representation; and (5) the absence of an effective system of checks and balances between the three branches of government.\nAs indicated, corruption, especially petty corruption, remains a common phenomenon in society. This is despite the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) accelerating its anti-corruption campaign with remarkable outcomes over the past 10 years since the founding of the Central Steering Committee for the Prevention of Corruption and Negative Practices in 2013. Violations of fundamental freedoms and human rights, such as freedoms of speech, press and assembly, are common and even worsening. Social ethics have arguably been degraded owing to the commercialization and commodification of all aspects of life. Inequality between and among social groups is not yet adequately addressed. COVID-19 has further deepened the gap between social groups in terms of income and employment.\nFor economic development to occur, it is imperative to carry out reforms aimed at emancipating forces so as to enhance productivity growth and eliminate the regulatory and administrative bottlenecks that hinder business and production activities. Large-scale infrastructure, such as ports and electricity grids, needs upgrading. In the institutional domain, political leadership recognizes the strong connection between good governance and high economic performance.\nGood governance here means accountability, transparency and inclusion in the political system. An incapable public administration, fragmentation of responsibilities between government levels and agencies, and a lack of checks and balances constrain the quality of the state. Therefore, the political leadership needs to have a strong political will to allow institutional and political reforms. The first thing to do is to build a meritocratic bureaucracy, strengthen state accountability and enhance citizen participation in decision-making processes. Some government agencies have piloted a merit-based promotion system, though it needs to be institutionalized and become part of the culture of employment. Efforts to curtail corruption in the policy sphere need to be accompanied by steps to permit the press and population to engage in whistle-blowing. Environmental protection needs to be prioritized as a national policy. Finally, expanding enrollment in upper-secondary education and achieving breakthroughs in the quality and relevance of higher education, technical and vocational education need to be urgently pursued.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        World Leaders Pledge Bold Action to Protect Present, Future Generations amid Climate Crisis, Conflicts Gripping Globe, as General Assembly Adopts Pact for Future\nToday the General Assembly adopted the Pact for the Future, in which Heads of State and Government — representing the peoples of the world — made 56 pledges to action seeking to protect the needs and interests of present and future generations amid the climate change, crisis and conflict currently gripping the globe.\nNevertheless, at the outset of the meeting, the representative of the Russian Federation proposed an amendment (document A/79/L.3) to the Pact, stating that “no one is happy with this text”. That amendment proposed the addition of language relating to the United Nations’ intervention in “matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State” and to avoiding certain duplication of effort.\nHowever, the representative of the Republic of the Congo, speaking for the African Group, underscored the need to show unity in finding solutions to today’s multiple, complex challenges. The adoption of such an amendment “is not going to help us meet our expectations”, he stressed, proposing a motion that no action be taken on the draft amendment. That motion was adopted by a recorded vote of 143 in favour to 7 against (Belarus, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Iran, Nicaragua, Russian Federation, Sudan, Syria), with 15 abstentions.\nThe Assembly then adopted the resolution titled “The Pact for the Future” (document A/79/L.2) without a vote. In the Pact’s opening terms, the Assembly committed to bold, ambitious, accelerated, just and transformative actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to place the eradication of poverty at the centre of the efforts to do that.\nBy other terms, world leaders pledged to close the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) financing gap in developing countries, to ensure that the multilateral trading system continues to be an engine for sustainable development and to accelerate reform of the international financial architecture to strengthen the voice and representation of developing countries. The Assembly also committed to reform the Security Council, recognizing the urgent need to make it more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable. The Pact also contains terms relating to gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, as well as a commitment to promote, protect and respect the human rights of all young people.\nFurther, the Pact has two annexes, the first of which — the Global Digital Compact — outlines the objectives of closing all digital divides; fostering an inclusive, open, safe and secure digital space that respects, protects and promotes human rights; and enhancing international governance of artificial intelligence. In the second annex — Declaration on Future Generations — the Assembly adopted a set of guiding principles, commitments and actions to promote international stability, peace and security and to ensure peaceful, inclusive and just societies while addressing inequalities within and among nations and the special needs of developing countries, as well as people in vulnerable situations.\n“Our future is in our hands,” emphasized Philémon Yang (Cameroon), President of the General Assembly at its seventy-ninth session, following the Pact’s adoption. The document represents a pledge to address immediate crises and lay the foundation for a sustainable, just and peaceful global order for all peoples and nations. Underscoring the need to ensure a future where peace transcends the mere absence of conflict and is grounded in justice, inclusion and equity, he said that meaningful progress requires that all voices are heard and that all nations — regardless of size or wealth — have a seat at the table.\nAntónio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, then noted that he called for the Summit of the Future “because our world is heading off the rails” as “resources that could bring opportunities and hope are invested in death and destruction”. Stating that the international community has “unlocked the door” by adopting the Pact and its annexes, he urged: “Now it is our common responsibility to walk through it.” Ultimately, however, “we stand and fall not by adopting agreements — but by our actions and their impact on the lives of the people we serve”, he concluded.\nOlaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany — the Pact’s co-facilitator, along with Namibia — also urged those present to take steps towards a more peaceful, fairer world, stating that, while “the road ahead is rocky”, history will judge Member States for their commitment to the plan at hand. Nangolo Mbumba, President of Namibia, added that the world is at a crossroads. One path leads to environmental catastrophe, widening inequality, global conflict, destruction and the rise of dangerous technology that threatens peoples’ security and civil liberties; the other, to peace, the eradication of poverty and hunger and the responsible harnessing of digital technologies for the benefit of humanity.\nWhen the floor opened, more than 70 countries — many of whom were represented at the highest level — took the podium to underscore the urgent need for renewed action if the international community is to meet the targets it has set for itself. Speakers also called for sustainable financing for development, investment in women and youth and a more-representative United Nations.\nProliferating global conflicts also courted discussion in this context, as many speakers stressed that development cannot be achieved without a strong foundation of peace, security and stability. Among them was Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, Prime Minister of Qatar, who said that his country — to that end — is involved in many mediation efforts. This includes Qatar’s work with Egypt and the United States to end the catastrophic war in Gaza. Diplomacy and dialogue are critical for achieving peace, said Mohammed Shia’ al Sudani, Prime Minister of Iraq, noting his country’s focus on promoting international relations based on mutual respect.\nNevertheless, Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera, President of Malawi, said that the world is not likely to meet the SDG targets because “we seem more interested in moving with speed in destroying the future than we are in replenishing”. Similarly, To Lam, President of Viet Nam, urged: “We need to shift our focus from investing in destructive weapons to enhancing health care and education.” The international community, stressed Viola Amherd, President of Switzerland, must work together “to ensure that our common future is not determined exclusively by national self-interest”. Tshering Tobgay, Prime Minister of Bhutan, concurred: “We must prioritize policies that serve the common good over narrow interests.”\nUltimately, implementation of the words within the Pact is what matters, pointed out Alar Karis, President of Estonia, adding: “Perhaps we cannot achieve perfection, but we must ensure that we save people from war, famine, torture and injustice.” Wavel Ramkalawan, President of the Seychelles, urged that “we cannot afford to make commitments to strengthen global cooperation” on various issues “only to see them diluted in implementation”. Calling for “a world where the multilateral system is not resolution after resolution, gathering dust” — but a dynamic force — Mohamed Muizzu, President of the Maldives, stressed that it is time for the multilateral system to produce tangible results.\n“We do not have time to waste,” stressed Sadyr Zhaparov, President of Kyrgyzstan, urging “decisive” action to strengthen the connections between nations and forge global partnerships to address challenges such as forced migration, climate threats and the unjust distribution of resources. Stressing that “inaction is not an option”, Chandrikapersad Santokhi, President of Suriname, pointed to Caribbean nations’ lack of financial resources to invest in health, education and infrastructure due to external debt. The failure to share global resources will continue to drive humanity to war, social disintegration and migration and “condemn us to live in two separate worlds”, added Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados.\n“The future is not distant,” stressed Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana — “it is here, and the choices we make here will determine the fate of generations to come.” No nation, regardless of power, can solve today’s challenges alone, he stated. Noting that today’s problems are “too extreme, too global to be addressed in isolated effort”, Edi Rama, Prime Minister of Albania, urged delegations that “multilateralism is not a choice – it is an urgent necessity”.\n“On the one hand,” concluded Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, “we can bury our heads in the sand, eschewing multilateralism in favour of short-sighted self-interest; or, we can recognize that — collectively — we have a responsibility to set our differences aside.”\nAction\nPrior to the opening segment, the representative of the Russian Federation introduced amendment A/79/L.3 to resolution A/79/L.2 titled by the same name, “The Pact for the Future”, stressing that there is nothing of substance to adopt today. But that is not the fault of the current President of the General Assembly and his predecessor. “They inherited this problem from previous predecessors, and did all they could, but didn’t have enough time,” he added. The Russian Federation requested sitting down and discussing the problem at the same table, but that idea was shut down. “This cannot be called multilateralism,” he continued, also adding that: “What happened is a major defeat for the UN principles of the sovereign [and] equality of States enshrined in the Charter.” This was sacrificed for the interest of a certain group of countries. What about the principle of “Leaving No One Behind”? he asked.\n“Essentially, no one is happy with this text,” he emphasized. It would have would have been optimal not to put forward this non-consensus-based test, but to continue negotiations until this document finally is acceptable to all. He went on to say that the amendment proposed by him today is not ignoring the needs of the Global South but trying to protect them from pressure from the collective West, which has not honoured its previous obligations. And “now they are hiding behind the backs” of the Global South. He urged all delegations to vote for the amendment.\nThe representative of the Republic of the Congo, speaking on behalf of the African Group, stated: “It is our collective responsibility to ensure and guarantee a better future for current and future generations.” The international community is now at a crossroads that will define our common future, he observed, underscoring the need to show unity and find answers to multiple complex challenges faced today. The adoption of the proposed amendment “is not going to help us meet our expectations”, he added.\nThe representative of Mexico seconded the motion of no action and urged all Member States to vote in favour of the motion. He pointed out that the amendment “was never raised during negotiations”, preventing proper consideration by delegations. Although his country had hoped to propose amendments on issues that represent “a priority” for Mexico’s foreign policy, he stressed that the current text lays “the foundation for the future work of the Organization”.\nThe delegate of Cameroon then took the floor to express his support for the motion introduced by Congo on behalf of the African Group.\nThe representative of Venezuela, speaking also on behalf of Iran and Syria, opposed the motion for no action introduced by Congo, describing it as a “procedural manoeuvre” that reflects “the arrogant view of certain Western States” during the negotiation process. Noting the lack of consensus on the Pact for the Future due to “the lack of political willingness of those same countries to enter into good faith negotiations over the last 18 months”, he urged Member States to reject the motion for no action and vote in favour of the amendment contained in document A/79/L.3.\nThe representative of Belarus requested the Assembly examine the substance of the amendment contained in document “L.3”.\nThe Assembly then took a recorded vote on the motion submitted by the representative of Congo, that no action be taken on draft amendment “L.3”.\nThe motion was adopted by a recorded vote of 143 in favour to 7 against (Belarus, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Iran, Nicaragua, Russian Federation, Sudan, Syria), with 15 abstentions.\nThe Assembly then took action on the resolution titled “Pact for the Future” contained in document “L.2”, adopting it without a vote.\nStatements\nPHILÉMON YANG (Cameroon), President of the General Assembly, said: “Our future is in our hands.” With the power to make important choices for the future, “we stand at a crossroads of global transformation, facing unprecedented challenges that demand urgent, collective action”. From conflict and climate change to the digital divide, from inequalities to threats against human rights, humanity faces profound challenges. “Yet, alongside these challenges, there is hope,” he stressed, as challenges come along with the opportunity for renewal, innovation and global cooperation. The Pact of the Summit of the Future represents the pledge to address immediate crises and lay the foundations for a sustainable, just and peaceful global order for all peoples and nations. The commitments embodied in the Pact and its annexes must encourage the international community to promote international peace and security, invigorate the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), foster just and inclusive societies and ensure that technology always serves the common good of humankind. =\n“We must move forward, together, in a spirit of solidarity and multilateral cooperation,” he said, citing the Summit of the Future as “a call to action” that “recommits us to the principles of international law, the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the promise of the United Nations Charter to save future generations from the pain of war”. He underscored the need to ensure a future where peace transcends the mere absence of conflict and is grounded in justice, inclusion and equity. Meaningful progress requires that all voices are heard and that all nations — regardless of size or wealth — have a seat at the table. Also, he continued, it is vital to recognize that none of the SDGs will be achieved without the full participation of women and girls as well as young people — “the torchbearers of tomorrow”. This is especially true in Africa, where more young people will enter the workforce each year than in the rest of the world combined. “Together, let us rise to this moment with courage and determination as we accelerate our journey towards a brighter future for everyone, everywhere,” he concluded.\nANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, delivering opening remarks, emphasizing the urgent need to “bring multilateralism back from the brink”, said that he called for the Summit of the Future to “to consider deep reforms, to make global institutions more legitimate, fair and effective”. “I called for this summit because our world is heading off the rails — and we need tough decisions to get back on track,” he underscored. Highlighting the multiple challenges of the twenty-first century — ranging from multiplying conflicts to huge inequalities and fragile collective security — he warned that “resources that could bring opportunities and hope are invested in death and destruction”. “Our multilateral tools and institutions are unable to respond effectively to today’s political, economic, environmental and technological challenges,” he underscored, cautioning: “And tomorrow’s will be even more difficult and dangerous.”\nThe Security Council “is eroding” in credibility due to its outdated structure, and the international financial architecture — designed during the colonial era — no longer addresses today’s economic challenges, including debt and climate action, he said. Against this backdrop, he underscored the urgency of reforms, stating that “we cannot wait for perfect conditions” and that now is the time for decisive action to make international cooperation “more networked, fair and inclusive”. He went on to introduce three key agreements — the Pact for the Future, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations — praising them as steps towards “more effective, inclusive, networked multilateralism towards reforming multilateralism”. He noted that these agreements “open pathways to new possibilities”, including reforms to the Security Council and international financial architecture. “We have unlocked the door. Now it is our common responsibility to walk through it,” he said, urging Member States to take action and implement these agreements. “We stand and fall not by adopting agreements, but by our actions and their impact on the lives of the people we serve,” he concluded. To this end, the Summit of the Future, he emphasized, sets the course for a new era of international cooperation that can meet expectations of the people.\nGHANIM MOHAMMED AL MUFTAH, United Nations youth representative from Qatar and a political science graduate, said that the decisions made today are not just about policies and strategies. They are about shaping a world where all children can thrive in an inclusive, safe and sustainable future. “As a person with disability, I have learned that true progress comes not from overcoming personal challenges alone, but from how we, as a society, embrace each other’s differences,” he said. Sadly, there is no choice for children where wars and conflicts cause unnecessary injuries and life-long disabilities. It is in our hands to stop this global trend of violence, in Gaza and around the world. “The future belongs to our youth and we must ensure that they are prepared to take on leadership roles,” he said.\nNIRIA ALICIA GARCIA, United Nations youth representative from the United States, said: “Our Mother Earth is hurting” — worldwide, water and sacred places are being desecrated, and corporate greed and war are pushing life to the verge of extinction. Global governance and politics are void of spirituality morality, and basic respect for life. “My generation’s hearts are breaking as we survive the impacts of climate disaster that could have been prevented […] as we watch genocide of our Palestinian relatives live on our phones, despite the global call for a ceasefire,” she said. The Pact for the Future mentions words like “sustainable development” nearly 300 times, yet words like “children”, “Earth” and “future generations” are mentioned less than 60 times. “This is green colonialism and it needs to stop,” she asserted, pointing to zero mentions of plants and animals or Indigenous Peoples’ rights. “Do Indigenous People still not exist to you,” she asked, adding that their continued exclusion will inevitably lead to more destruction, pain and suffering. Yet, there is hope to create real intergenerational solutions, she emphasized, calling on global leaders to “go home and ratify the UN declaration on the rights of Indigenous Peoples […] begin to meaningfully engage youth, cut the military budget and allocate those funds for climate solutions, to pay reparations […] and give Indigenous People our land back”.\nMONICAH MALITH, a youth refugee from South Sudan, said that the escalating refugee crises is among “the most pressing issues” facing the world caused by lack of peace and security. Reflecting on her own journey as a refugee from South Sudan, she spoke about the educational opportunities she received in Kenya, which enabled her to receive a law degree and “stand as a voice for the youth — for refugees, and for all those forgotten”. Noting that the plight of refugees underscores the collective responsibility, she urged to provide them with “not just immediate assistance but also long-term, compassionate solutions” to uphold their dignity and enable their meaningful contribution to society. She stressed the importance of education as a tool for progress, urging Governments and stakeholders to “think big on funding for education”. In a call for action for leaders, she warned that while Governments talk of reforms, “the gaps are growing wider still”. Therefore, future deliberations should “not be rehearsed platitudes, but revolutions of thoughts”, she stressed. Addressing the youth, she stated that “the future is ours to forge. […] It belongs to the bold.”\nOLAF SCHOLZ, Chancellor of Germany, said that the Pact for the Future can serve as a compass towards cooperation instead of conflict. The Pact shows determination to restore international justice and that all the talk of polarization will not be the story of the United Nations. “We are still committed to the principles of the United Nations Charter,” he added. The text is the achievement of the countless men and women who overcome fatigue and political and ideological divides. “You have proved that multilateralism is alive,” he said, urging Member States to take steps towards a world that is peaceful, a world that is fairer. History will judge Member States if they do not commit to the plan at hand. “The road ahead is rocky,” he added, emphasizing that Germany stands ready to extend its hand to anyone willing to work together towards a better future.\nNANGOLO MBUMBA, President of Namibia, reiterated the commitment to the current and future generations — a world where all peoples and countries are prosperous, more loving, inclusive and tolerant — noting that this summit presents a historic opportunity. The world is at a crossroads — one path leads to environmental catastrophe, widening inequality and leading to global conflict, destruction and the rise of dangerous technology that threatens peoples’ security and civil liberty. The other path offers hope for climate change, global peace, the eradication of poverty and hunger, and the responsible harnessing of digital technologies for the benefit of humanity.\nTo this end, he underscored the need to reform international organizations, including the Security Council. The UN must empower nations and regions to adopt comprehensive pathways to ensure economic prosperity, strengthen global agreements and institutions to ensure the effective implementation of the SDGs and finance these goals through innovative global financing architecture. “We need the UN,” because at the heart of the institution is the principle of global solutions to global problems, he observed, recognizing the profound significance of this summit for the future.\nJULIUS MAADA BIO, President of Sierra Leone, speaking on behalf of the Group of Seven-Plus (G7+) countries, said that the Summit represents a key moment for “reflection, collective action and renewed commitment” to build a “sustainable, just and equitable future”. For the G7+ countries, the challenges of instability are not distant — they are “the stark reality that we contend with every day”. He noted that the “Summit of the Future has offered us an opportunity to adopt the Pact of the Future”, a road map for a “more inclusive, secure and sustainable world”. Against this backdrop, he stressed that peace and development “must be driven from within”, and efforts to address fragility should be grounded in dialogue, reconciliation and inclusive governance. Highlighting the importance of promoting sustainable development in conflict-affected countries, he noted that progress is hindered by persistent challenges of fragility. Therefore, he called for “increased international cooperation, innovative financing mechanisms and tailored approaches” to ensure no country is left behind. He further emphasized that “international peace and security form the bedrock of global development”, and for countries recovering from conflict, strengthening institutions, promoting the rule of law and addressing root causes remain essential.\nRASHAD MOHAMMED AL-ALIMI, President of Yemen, said his country has suffered from war, but its aspirations are still unified with the people of the world because Yemen believes in a global collaboration toward a prosperous future for all. Despite the grave challenges faced by the Yemeni people, they remain steadfast in confronting Iran-backed militias destabilizing their country. “We are trying to confront violent and extremism,” he added, emphasizing that the Yemeni generation born into conflict deserve to live in a peaceful and prosperous country. For that reason, Yemen has launched programmes that benefit women and young people aimed at boosting their development. Yemen is also working with the international community to come up with a strategy to end the conflict and deal with its humanitarian and climate challenges such as drought.\nLUIZ INÁCIO LULA DA SILVA, President of Brazil, highlighted “great responsibilities to those who will succeed us”: to not back down from the promotion of equality between men and women and the fight against racism and all forms of discrimination. Also, he stressed, “we cannot live with nuclear threats again, nor fuel new arms races on Earth or in space”, noting that it is unacceptable to regress to a world divided into ideological borders or zones of influence. Naturalizing the hunger of 733 million people would be shameful, he added. For its part, Brazil will promote a global ethical stocktaking, bringing together different civil society sectors to think about climate action from the perspective of justice, equity and solidarity. The Pact for the Future addresses essential topics — such as the debt of developing countries and international taxation — in a groundbreaking manner. Calling for structural transformations, he stressed that the legitimacy of the Security Council shrinks every time it applies double standards or remains silent in the face of atrocities. Also, he pointed out, the Global South is not represented in a way that is consistent with its current political, economic and demographic weight.\nLAZARUS MCCARTHY CHAKWERA, President of Malawi, said that the world is not likely to meet the SDG targets, because “we seem more interested in moving with speed in destroying the future than we are in replenishing”. Underscoring that “the old men and women in this Assembly” have the responsibility to build solutions for a future they will not inherit, he called for making the Pact for the Future free of past prejudices and today’s conflicts. “Sustainable development is untenable without sustainable financing,” he stressed, calling for financing that is affordable and will catalyse global development in developing countries. Expressing concern over unresolved global conflicts, he asserted that “no one in this room should still cling to the naive illusion that we live in a world where a war can be won”, calling for a rules-based approach and peaceful dispute resolutions. In Malawi, and across Africa, the youth “are not just our future, but our present”, he underscored, urging for investment in technical skills and youth potential to harness the Fourth Industrial Revolution. He went on to reiterate the call for “a UN that is fit for the future through fair representation and enhanced capacity to deal with complicated global challenges fit for the future”.\nSADYR ZHAPAROV, President of Kyrgyzstan, said that, to build strong bridges between the past and the future, “we must strengthen the connections between nations”. In that regard, the Summit of the Future is an important platform to rethink global partnerships focused on addressing various challenges, such as the spike in forced migration, climate threats and the unjust distribution of resources. “We must take decisive action as soon as possible; we do not have time to waste,” he stressed. Kyrgyzstan has made progress in eradicating poverty and its successful experience with the SDGs only shows that with the right vision and political will, even small countries with limited resources can achieve mighty goals. The world being built today will become the source of hopes and dreams of generations to come, he added. “We cannot leave here without taking decisive action,” he said.\nCYRIL RAMAPHOSA, President of South Africa, said world conflicts and the spectre of emerging conflict are “ever-persistent features of our times”. Climate change poses an existential threat and reverses development goals in numerous parts of the world. These challenges transcend borders, he said, underscoring the need to forge global solutions that are embedded in the Pact, which presents a great opportunity to reinvigorate the multilateral system so that it is fit to address global challenges. Underlining the need to reform the global governance architecture, he observed that placing the fate of the world’s security of a select few — where it is the vast majority of the peoples of the world who bear the brunt of various threats — is unsustainable and unjust. The Summit is an opportunity to make progress on the SDGs, realize the fundamental right to development and accelerate the collective effort to advance development, he said, declaring: “Action is what is required now.”\nJOSEPH NYUMA BOAKAI, President of Liberia, said that following peaceful elections in his country, the Government has introduced an ambitious agenda focusing on agriculture, rule of law, education, sanitation and tourism. Despite facing challenges in making progress towards the SDGs, Liberia remains determined and dedicated to overcoming these obstacles, he said. Citing the 2024 Financing for Sustainable Development Report, he drew attention to the fact that least developed countries are now spending “12 per cent of their revenues on interest payments” — four times more than a decade ago — stressing the urgent need for reform in the global financial system. To accelerate the progress on the SDG achievement, he called for a transformation of global governance and “for a financial system that prioritizes liquidity and reduces the burden of development nation for a financial system”. “By promoting international cooperation and accountability, we can create a fairer financial environment that empowers our countries to pursue their development goals,” he emphasized. He went on to urge the international community “work together to remove the barriers that hinder potential and enable us to advance our shared vision for sustainable development”.\nALAR KARIS, President of Estonia, said that the Pact of the Future is a document of words; how it is going to be implemented is what matters. The world has witnessed brutal aggression in recent years, including from a permanent member of the Security Council. To deter crimes against humanity and war crimes, all Member States must demand accountability from Security Council to make sure no one can shield themselves from punishment of their own crimes with the veto. “Let us make every effort from additional finance to capacity-building to bridge divides between countries,” he said. Women and girls must have equal footing to step into the future. “Perhaps we cannot achieve perfection, but we must ensure that we save people from war, famine, torture and injustice,” he added. Non-stop hard work is needed, even if results are not immediate.\nNANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO, President of Ghana, said “the future is not distant: it is here, and the choices we make here will determine the fate of generations to come”. No nation, no matter how powerful, can solve today’s challenges alone, he stressed, adding that the climate crisis, inequality, pandemics, terrorism and violent extremism are not local problems — they demand global solutions. At the heart of today’s crisis is the climate emergency, which threatens humanity’s very existence. Africa — while contributing the least to global emissions — bears the heaviest burden: from floods to desertification, it is already experiencing its devastating effects. Despite the promises, the vulnerable remain abandoned. “We are told to adapt and be resilient, but how does one adapt to famine or build resilience when farmers cannot predict the seasons?”, he asked, underscoring that the continent cannot continue to pay for a crisis it did not create. “We demand fairness, not charity,” he asserted, adding that climate justice requires an economic system that works for everyone, not just the privileged few. The multilateral system, especially the United Nations, should be at the forefront of this effort, he stressed, calling for the reform of the Security Council to ensure that Africa’s voice is heard in shaping the future of global peace and security.\nDENIS BEĆIROVIĆ, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, said that global challenges can only be addressed through good quality international cooperation. Therefore, it is “imperative to establish a strong multilateral system based on inclusiveness”, he stressed. “We can only create a world of security, justice and prosperity through joint work, solidarity and mutual respect,” he underscored, urging for concrete actions to ensure peace and stability for future generations. The Pact for the Future is very necessary at this time of crisis for democracy and multilateralism, he asserted, adding that “the character of today’s challenges clearly identifies the path of our response”. “That is why multilateralism is the best response,” he underscored. Noting that the future belongs to the young generations, he advocated for the “concrete involvement” of young people in the shaping of policies at the national and global level. He further called for “concrete and comprehensive implementation” of the adopted Pact for the Future, adding that “the Summit is opening a new chapter in a process of strengthening multilateralism that is needed to all of us.”\nTO LAM, President of Viet Nam, said that decisions made today will shape the landscape of the future. “We need to shift our focus from investing in destructive weapons to enhancing health care and education,” he added. That will help future generations be better able to commit to peace and prosperity rather than war and destruction. At this critical juncture, strengthening solidarity and mutual respect among Member States is essential. The world’s wealthiest countries must act responsibly and must be willing to share science and technology advancements to foster collective growth. Joint efforts and collective action are what is urgently needed to implement the Pact for the Future. For its part, Viet Nam is committed to working towards those goals and building a brighter future for all.\nMOHAMED MUIZZU, President of Maldives, called for “a world where the multilateral system is not resolution after resolution, gathering dust”, but a dynamic force. Noting that visions crafted at the UN often remain unrealized, he stressed that it is time for the multilateral system to produce tangible results. “We must empower our young people who shape the world today and will lead the world tomorrow,” he said, adding that an enabling environment is “key to true empowerment”. To this end, it is vital to ensure that every young person has access to the latest technology and enable the youth to seize the opportunity before them. Additionally, he underscored the need to combat climate change, noting that climate anxiety is not “a hypothetical term”. He said the Summit should honour a previous commitment to the world’s oceans and marine resources, adding that financing is the key to turning aspirations into reality.\nCHANDRIKAPERSAD SANTOKHI, President of Suriname, said the international community must act now, with urgency, to make this world a better place. “Inaction is not an option,” he stressed. Highlighting multiple existential threats facing the Caribbean, including his country, he drew attention to the lack of financial resources to invest in critical sectors, such as health, education and infrastructure. This is due to the external debts faced by these countries. “The global financial system continues to disadvantage, and at times alienate, these nations,” he noted, expressing hope that the multidimensional vulnerability index will be adopted in the work of international financial institutions. Noting that the 2030 Agenda remains a blueprint for his country, he pointed out uneven and alarmingly slow progress. Urging the countries to accelerate efforts to meet the SDGs, he underscored the importance of providing assistance to small and vulnerable nations, while recognizing that “the principal obstacles to growth and progress are not of their doing”. “We must transition from fragmented and divisive approaches to comprehensive, inclusive and transparent global rule-based governance structures,” he said, calling for a strengthened multilateral system.\nJOSÉ MARIA NEVES, President of Cabo Verde, said that the world is facing challenges that are increasingly global with consequences that are disproportionately affecting the world’s most vulnerable. The absence of peace and security has been exacerbated by the proliferation of wars of aggression, inter-State conflict and acts of terrorism across all continents. On the other hand, even where war is absent, instances of political tensions, unconstitutional seizures of power and human rights violations have been increasing. Unequal access to the benefits of science, technology and innovation, are major global challenges that are holding back true development. Reform in the Security Council is essential to making it more effective and world more inclusive. “Nevertheless, it is equally important to underline that our commitment to reforming multilateral governance cannot and should not distract us or relive us from what we must do at the national and regional levels,” he said. Among those goals must be strengthening rule of law, upholding inclusive societies and deepening democratic practice.\nVIOLA AMHERD, President of Switzerland, underscored that to drive forward the necessary reforms, it is vital to ensure a strong political will and rebuild trust. The Pact is proving to be an essential and clear signal of commitment to the multilateral system, she said, noting the need to work together “to ensure that our common future is not determined exclusively by national self-interest”. “Now is the time to act with even more determination,” she asserted, stressing that “multilateralism needs this, and we need multilateralism”. She underlined her country’s firm commitment to the values of multilateralism and determination to continue on the path towards a more sustainable, just and peaceful world.\nKHURELSUKH UKHNAA, President of Mongolia, said that the documents adopted today — the Pact for the Future, Declaration on the Future Generations and the Global Digital Compact — mark “a significant milestone in reaffirming our shared goals and political aspirations during these challenging times”. Stressing the importance of “strengthening multilateral cooperation”, he described it as “vital for ensuring international peace and security”. Enhanced dialogue, mutual understanding and trust are the “fundamentals for global stability and coexistence”, he said, voicing confidence that the Summit of the Future will advance the SDGs. Highlighting his country’s efforts in preparation for the Summit, he recalled the successful hosting of the World Women’s Forum, themed “Towards a Green Future”, which resulted in the adoption of the Ulaanbaatar Declaration “Towards a Sustainable Future”.\nWAVEL RAMKALAWAN, President of Seychelles, said the stakes at this summit cannot be emphasized enough. “We cannot afford to make commitments to strengthen global cooperation on climate action, sustainable development and equitable access to resources only to see them diluted in implementation,” he said. The harsh truth is that, despite ambitions, there is a real risk that these commitments will fall short continuing to marginalize those who are already most at risk, shutting them out of the very decision-making processes that shape the future. Addressing the digital divide is just as crucial as this inequality threatens to widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Strong partnerships are vital to ensuring equitable access to the technologies and infrastructure that underpin modern development. These efforts must be supported by resilient multilateral institutions, international cooperation, global solidarity and shared responsibility, as no nation can tackle these immense challenges alone.\nHASSANAL BOLKIAH, Sultan of Brunei Darussalam, recalled that the UN has navigated the rise and fall of empires, and the impact of natural hazards and pandemics. Amid these difficulties, its core humanitarian principles “have remained our guiding light as we confront new and emerging global challenges”, he said, adding that only through global peace can humankind achieve remarkable advancements in technology, medicine and infrastructure. The Summit reinforces the commitment that no one is left behind, firmly anchored in the values that define our shared humanity. Underscoring that the current international peace landscape is at a critical juncture — with persistent conflicts and diplomatic impasses testing the resilience of global cooperation — he said that “together, we can transform our collective vision into a vibrant reality for ourselves and for generations to come”.\nMICHAEL D. HIGGINS, President of Ireland, emphasized that in the face of existential challenges, it is “not sufficient nor morally acceptable” to offer superficial solutions. Instead, the urgency of the situation calls for authenticity by “matching words to actions” to rebuild trust. “Never have so many had so little and so few accumulated so much without responsibility,” he said, adding that these challenges are “the consequences of a globalization from above, led by the powerful, without transparency, without consideration as to social justice or ecological consequences”. “A new, inclusive globalization from below” is a response needed “to achieve a new invigorated United Nations”. In envisaging a United Nations of the future, he urged to have the courage to look at not only current weaknesses, but at “abuses of power” that have consciously undermined the Organization since its founding. Pointing out the 3.2 billion people who live in countries where more is spent on debt interest payments than on basic services, he underscored the urgency of eliminating hunger and poverty, calling for “the few” States to “indicate their willingness to change” to avoid the “horrific consequences of climate change” and “prevent the conclusion that, as a species, we have failed to the achieve peace”.\nCHARLES MICHEL, President of the European Council, speaking on behalf of the European Union delegation, said that finding the best way to tackle common challenges is the “shared mission of our generation”, and this summit is a unique moment to boost that ambition. “We must urgently reform our international financial architecture,” he said, calling for Member States to fulfil past commitments. The Union, together with its member States, is at the forefront of global development financing. “We cannot accept that low- and middle-income countries must choose between fighting poverty and fighting climate change,” he said. They must be able to do both. The Pact for the Future sends a powerful signal of confidence that “despite our differences, despite the challenges we face, we can work together, and we want to work together”, he said.\nCÉSAR BERNARDO ARÉVALO DE LEÓN, President of Guatemala, said the Pact of the Future should allow the international community to address challenges and shortcomings in the global governance system and recommit to building a multinational order. Spotlighting challenges faced by developing and least developed countries — including those related to development and climate change — he underlined the importance of applying the principle of effective geographic representation. Further, he stressed the need to address the problem of sovereign debts and comply with international law and treaties. Turning to the situation in Gaza, he criticized the Council’s inability to stop the aggression, adding that double standards should not be applied in international law.\nEDI RAMA, Prime Minister of Albania, called for the courage to admit that “our actions have too often fallen far short of the expectations of the people we claim to serve.” As the international community has “consistently squandered the opportunities each crisis has presented for meaningful change”, he asked what can be done to rebuild the trust. “How do we inspire instead of demoralize the ordinary people?” he further asked. Noting that the world has changed dramatically and “seems to have lost any common sense”, he stressed that the United Nations “remains irreplaceable”. “This is where we must begin”, he asserted, adding that “multilateralism is not a choice; it is an urgent necessity” in tackling deeply interconnected global challenges. Noting that today’s problems “are too extreme, too global to be addressed in isolated effort”, he cited his country’s history of standing up for humanity, from protecting Jews during the Second World War to sheltering thousands of Afghans after the fall of Kabul.\nMOHAMMED SHIA' AL SUDANI, Prime Minister of Iraq, said that achieving balance between the three pillars of sustainable development is his country’s priority. However, addressing Iraq’s myriad challenges requires effective cooperation. “We are providing investments to ensure economic diversification,” he added. Iraq is cognizant of the fact that sustainable development will require ambitious investment in the future. Iraq is also focused on promoting international relations based on the principles of mutual respect. Diplomacy and dialogue are critical in achieving peace. He went on to underscore the role of science and technology as a foundation of sustainable development. Youth are the driving force of the future and Iraq is providing them an environment conducive to help promote their development. He pledged Baghdad’s commitment to working with the international community for a better future.\nMIA AMOR MOTTLEY, Prime Minister of Barbados, said: “We come together as one human family, sharing one planet and building together a common future.” She underscored the importance of interconnectedness in taking decisive steps to end the horrors faced by humanity and create new structures. Past generations ended wars, dismantled slavery, ended apartheid, acted to stop genocide, declared all people equal, gave women the right to vote and ended colonialism. It is vital to change the global governance structures rooted in the outcome of the Second World War, she pointed out, stressing that “what the world needs now is a reset”. The failure to share the world’s resources will continue to drive humanity to war, social disintegration and migration and “condemn us to live in two separate worlds”. “Now is the time to choose hope and love over hate and division,” she said, adding that this does not require new technologies but action and humanity. “We, the people of the world, have no other choice and no other planet to live,” she concluded.\nNTSOKOANE SAMUEL MATEKANE, Prime Minister of Lesotho, said that the time has come to reflect on “the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”. Asking whether the world still has faith in the Organization, he said that the United Nations should “endeavour to break traditional tendencies and employ innovative strategies to give practical meaning to the lofty aspirations of the global citizenry”. To this end, the Summit of the Future presents an opportunity for the international community to revitalize and fortify the multilateral system, ensuring that the UN remains relevant and resilient. “We must work together to defend multilateralism and resist inward-looking protectionist policies,” he urged, adding that the Summit represents an opportunity “to bring back hope to our respective nations”. Turning to sustainable development and financing for development, he underscored the need to execute action-oriented strategies to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda. He further urged to keep a strong multilateral framework for peace and security in pace with the times as well as to close the digital divide.\nMOHAMMED BIN ABDULRAHMAN BIN JASSIM AL-THANI, Prime Minister of Qatar, said that the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of the SDGs require more international, as well as national efforts. “Our world is faced today with unsurmountable challenges that obstruct its economic development,” he added. Wars and conflicts and the negative impacts of climate change are serious challenges, in particular for developing countries. He stressed the importance reforming international financial institutions and bridging the digital gap. Development cannot be achieved without the strong foundations of peace, security and stability. To that end, Qatar is involved in many mitigation efforts, including currently between Israel and Palestine, alongside Egypt and the United States, to put an end to the catastrophic war on Gaza. He also reiterated calls to reach a ceasefire agreement and the release of all hostages.\nANDREW HOLNESS, Prime Minister of Jamaica, said that small island developing States are particularly off-track to meet the SDGs. “We must redouble our efforts to address global poverty, inequality and food insecurity,” he stressed, noting the need to limit global temperature increase and deliver a future that fosters peaceful societies. Humanity is facing unprecedented challenges to international peace and security, mainly driven by geopolitical motivations and transnational organized crime networks, he observed, adding that the Pact provides a framework “within which we can all coexist in peace and harmony”.\nBJARNI BENEDIKTSSON, Prime Minister of Iceland, said that the Pact “pulls no punches in identifying the challenges before us and identifying the existential risks we face”. “The Pact is also upfront about saying that the crisis has been caused, to a large extent, by our own choices,” he went on to say. No organization — other than the United Nations — has the convening power at a time of conflict between and within many Member States. Today, the world has agreed on a range of actions to close the sustainable development financing gap in developing countries, including by strengthening efforts to prevent and combat elicit financial flows, corruption and money-laundering. Member States have also underlined the central place of human rights in just peaceful and inclusive societies. “We have committed to respecting and protecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms,” he added, emphasizing the importance of protecting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons (LGBTI+) communities. Ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights is also vital, he added.\nDIMITAR BORISOV GLAVCHEV, caretaker Prime Minister of Bulgaria, said that the Summit and the Pact for the Future — which embodies nearly 80 years of multilateral and national experience — will create a safer, more sustainable and equitable world. Acknowledging the challenges of digital inequality, he advocated for increased investment in digital skills — especially for vulnerable populations — and quick adaptation to technological changes. “Our goal is a free, secure digital world with universal Internet access,” he said, voicing support for the Global Digital Compact. He further underscored the need to modernize the United Nations, including Security Council reform, to ensure its relevancy.\nFUMIO KISHIDA, Prime Minister of Japan, stressed the importance of clear guiding principles in times where nations with diverse values must collaborate. To this end, upholding the rule of law is critical, while unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force cannot be tolerated anywhere in the world. Underscoring that “human dignity” is the foundation for all international cooperation, he urged the international community to “invest in people”. “Empowering women, children and youth is a top priority,” he said. Turning to the issue of non-proliferation, he stressed that the progress cannot be stopped no matter how “difficult the path to a world without nuclear weapons may be”. Also, the reform of the Security Council is supported by most States, he said, urging for “concrete actions” towards the expansion of both permanent and non-permanent seats. “World leaders must unite under the banner of multilateralism, empowering every individual so they can realize his or her full potential and build a better future,” he concluded.\nTSHERING TOBGAY, Prime Minister of Bhutan, said humanity finds itself at a pivotal crossroads as it reaches the midpoint of the journey to the 2030 SDGs. “Yet, our determination remains unwavering,” he added. To realize such ambitious goals, the international community must muster the political will to transcend rhetoric and take decisive action. “We must prioritize policies that serve the common good over narrow interests,” he added. It is essential to guarantee that no country is left behind by providing innovative financing, equitable resource distribution and strong partnerships. “Success requires that we bridge the digital divide,” he went on. Peace, security and human rights must be guaranteed for all peoples in all countries by ensuring a multilateral system that is both robust and responsive. No nation can address global challenges in isolation, he added.\nKAY RALA XANANA GUSMÃO, Prime Minister of Timor-Leste, said that, “without peace, there are no conditions for development”. However, peace is an abstract concept for many nations, he observed, noting that Western Sahara has been waiting for its referendum since 1992. “International law has yet to reach this last colony in Africa, ignored and forgotten,” he added. Further, the international community has yet to find multilateral solutions for a future of peace for many nations worldwide — from Palestine to Ukraine, from Yemen to Sudan, from the Central African Republic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from Afghanistan to Myanmar, and from Haiti to many other fragile and conflict-ridden countries. “What kind of world are we living in, where we can fuel wars, but cannot feed children?”, he asked, pointing to thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean as people flee their homelands to escape conflict and poverty. “With this Pact for the Future, we hope the international community, especially world leaders, will approach this crisis with greater concern and sensitivity beyond the mere discussion of immigration issues,” he stressed.\nK.P. SHARMA OLI, Prime Minister of Nepal, speaking in his capacity as Chair of the Group of the Least Developed Countries, said “nothing could be more unjust and unethical” than ignoring millions of people in least developed countries who live in extreme poverty, while a small minority of States “accumulates billions in wealth each day”. “Is this the future we aspire to?”, he asked, urging the international community “to act now to ensure every child and young person has the chance to thrive”. Highlighting severe economic challenges, the growing digital divide, as well as the impacts of climate change faced by the least developed countries, he said these States are “frustrated by the continuation of these severe structural impediments”. “We must act now to pull the world back from the brink of catastrophe,” he stressed, calling for coordinated, comprehensive and science-based policies with least developed countries at the centre. Lauding the adoption of the Pact for the Future, he said it “encapsulates the hopes and optimism” by reinstalling the interlinkages among peace and security, sustainable development and human rights.\nROBERT GOLOB, Prime Minister of Slovenia, said that the Pact for the Future is even more important as the world is facing “a bleak future”. “Unless we can stop the wars, there is no common sustainable future,” he warned, urging to stop the aggression on Ukraine, Gaza, Palestine and all armed conflicts where civilians and kids are suffering. Peace is “a vital condition” for effectively tackling the climate crisis, which can only be achieved through “trust, solidarity and global stability”, he stressed. Turning to water diplomacy, he called for global partnerships to address the scarcity of water and the extreme weather in some regions of the world. “Extreme weather is hitting us all,” he said, noting that using advanced technology cooperatively is “the only way forward”. Detailing a new “super advanced digital ecosystem” developed in Slovenia that links satellite data, supercomputing and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict water availability, he offered to build a global partnership and to utilize this advanced technology to ensure access to clean, sustainable and safe water for all.\nKASSIM MAJALIWA MAJALIWA, Prime Minister of the United Republic of Tanzania, said the future presents a vital opportunity to restore trust in the multilateral system and to commit to a sustainable future for all. The escalating climate crisis is a pressing reality, particularly for nations like the United Republic of Tanzania, where its impact is felt daily. The United Republic of Tanzania is committed to global climate action and urges the international community to fulfil its duty regarding climate finance and technology transfer. Global and regional partnerships are vital for achieving shared goals. “We must foster solidarity and mutual respect in addressing climate change, advancing digital equity and promoting peace,” he added.\nALLAH MAYE HALINA, Prime Minister of Chad, spotlighted the unprecedented global challenges, including the dramatic consequences of climate change, which pose a direct threat to national and regional security. He also drew attention to major security challenges, such as the terrorist attacks of Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin region, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes. The countries in the region also face persistent security challenges, he observed, adding that regional instability has direct repercussions on Chad — “the largest welcomer of refugees in the world”. Against this backdrop, he underscored the need to strengthen mechanisms for international cooperation and guarantee sustainable and predictable financing for peacekeeping operations.\nEBBA BUSCH, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Energy, Business and Industry of Sweden, speaking as both a representative of her country and a mother, praised the fact that the Pact for the Future puts children’s rights “at the very centre”. Noting that digital and emerging technologies are reshaping almost every aspect of the world, she spotlighted the Global Digital Compact — “the road map to a digital future” that is open, safe, secure, sustainable and inclusive. Sweden, alongside Zambia, led efforts to create the Global Digital Compact, she said, stressing its role in helping “close digital divides” and “turbocharge the Sustainable Development Goals”. “A childhood in freedom requires safety online,” she said, adding that “at the very heart of this vision is the belief that technology, and in particularly AI, must serve humanity.” Pointing out the extensive global needs and the growing funding gap, she emphasized the importance of reforming the international financial system to ensure fair representation and legitimacy, as well as the need for the Security Council to reflect today’s realities, including “seats for African nations”. Turning to global conflicts, she reaffirmed her country’s commitment to peace, describing Mosocow’s aggression against Ukraine as “an attack” on the very principles that uphold the United Nations.\nENRIQUE AUSTRIA MANALO, Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, said the world is grappling with difficult decisions to stay the course in these days of complex crises and conflicts. He called on Member States to recommit multilateralism with the United Nations at the centre, flourishing on the grounds of a rules-based order that provides conditions for trust, solidarity, equity and peace. Respect for the rule of law safeguards global peace and security and enables the international community to confront complex current and future challenges together, he said. It is a touchstone for all international efforts to resolve disputes, prevent conflicts, protect human rights and enhance global governance. Preserving a rules based international order is a collective duty, he added.\nSAYYID BADR BIN HAMAD BIN HAMOOD ALBUSAIDI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Oman, underscoring the effectiveness of multilateralism, reaffirmed his country’s support for the Pact of the Future. The challenges that the international community is facing cannot be addressed by traditional means alone; they require innovative approaches based on the concept of sustainable development. “We have to act with wisdom and foresight,” he said, adding that it is essential to start implementing policies that focus on future generations. Stressing that international peace and security are the most fundamental pillars for the stability of the world, he said “preventive diplomacy [is] the most effective tool to prevent and settle disputes”. Young people are the agents of the future; his Government has therefore launched a number of initiatives and “innovation incubators” in science, industry, culture and sports, he said.\nTAYE ATSKE-SELASSIE AMDE, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia, noted that the Pact was negotiated amidst “great polarization” in international relations — “which doesn’t lend itself to the spirit of consensus and compromise” required to negotiate a global agenda. This, he said, is the “main reason that the Pact had to limit itself to reiteration and emphasis of already agreed global goals and targets”. While stressing that setbacks and regression in the implementation of the SDGs “require us to be more ambitious, not less”, he said that the Pact — if fully implemented — will “greatly enhance the fate of generations to come”. However, the international community’s inability to converge on more-ambitious targets is “a stark reminder of the need for change”, he said, urging delegations to move from rivalry to cooperation, enhance tolerance for policy differences and work to attain the “most basic” global agenda.\nALEXANDER DE CROO, Prime Minister of Belgium, said that, today, the world faces accelerating climate change, pandemics and wars impacting millions of people. “It is high time to deliver on our commitments,” he asserted, underlining the need to uphold commitments to the rule-based international order and respect and promote human rights, which are “backsliding globally”. In particular, the freedom of expression must be ensured, while politicians must be held accountable. Responding to today’s challenges means unlocking the potential of digital technologies, which are associated with immense potential and challenges, he emphasized.\nMOHAMAD HASAN, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malaysia, called on Member States to “galvanize holistic global governance, premised on humanity”. Noting that, by 2050, the planet will be home to a population of 10 billion people, he asked: “How will we feed the world then if we cannot do so now?” While education is the tool to address inequality, millions of children in the Global South are deprived of this very fundamental right. Stressing that the climate crisis “is not distant threat — it is here, it is real”, he called for action, backed by adequate climate financing, as well as technology transfer and innovation. He urged the international community to work towards a green development pact “that robustly addresses the scientific and technological divide between the North and the South”, as well as a global science fund to “encourage diverse and innovative solutions to the challenges we face, leveraging on our collective human capital”.\nBRUNO EDUARDO RODRÍGUEZ PARRILLA, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, said that today the world is still suffering from the effects of colonialism and neo-colonialism. “Our futurist debates continue while we are seeing a continuation of the genocide in Palestine without any effective response from the international community,” he stressed, adding that rising fascism, xenophobia and discrimination are fuelling hatred across the globe. Calling for “less interference and more solidarity”, he emphasized the need for equity, cooperation and respect for the people’s inalienable rights to choose political and social systems. To that end, the “criminal embargo imposed by the United States” against Cuba and the arbitrary inclusion of his country in the List of States-sponsors of Terrorism is the primary barrier to well-being and development. Criticizing “opulent societies” for their unbridled consumerism that causes climate crisis and global inequality, he warned that without political will to provide necessary funds for sustainable development and to ease debt for millions of people, a decent future will remain “a utopia”.\nABDOULAYE BIO TCHANE, Minister of State responsible for development and coordination of Government action of Benin, said the world faces several crises in the areas of environment, health, geopolitics, finances and security. This host of factors is not conducive to sustainable development. He warned against so-called solutions that divide, separate, exclude and pose significant threats for coexistence, multilateralism and international cooperation. For its part, Benin is committed to achieving the SDGs via its various projects dedicated to forging growth and reducing poverty. He went on to note his country’s progress in achieving the Goals. Despite the world achieving significant technical advancements, there is still increasing poverty, he also added. For Benin, the answer lies in multilateralism.\nMULAMBO HAMAKUNI HAIMBE, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Zambia, underscored the need to ensure international consensus on how to safeguard a better future, citing the Summit as an opportunity to reinvigorate multilateralism and tackle existing and emerging threats to the SDGs. The international community must collaborate in addressing numerous threats —including economic shocks, climate crisis and widening digital divide — and confront violations of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, he asserted. Also, with the global financing and investment gap, there is an urgent need to scale up action, he observed, noting that, between 2019 and 2021, “Zambia was one of the 25 African countries that spent more on interest payments than health”.\nOLIVIER NDUHUNGIREHE, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Rwanda, said the Pact is a comprehensive, forward-looking document, the implementation of which will ensure that future generations inherit a world that is “not only sustainable, but also equitable and just.” His country “understands only too well the importance of unity”, he said, adding that the Summit should be the beginning of transformative action. Effectively addressing the challenges confronting the international community calls for an adaptive mindset, he said, adding that it is essential to embrace innovative solutions and build resilient systems and structures. “Together let’s embark on transforming our aspirations into tangible realities,” he said, stressing the importance of addressing climate change, preparing for future pandemics and harnessing the power of technology.\nJOYELLE CLARKE, Minister for Sustainable Development, Environment, Climate Action and Constituency Empowerment of Saint Kitts and Nevis, pointed out that small island developing States grapple with the “poly-crises” of biodiversity loss, plastic pollution and climate change. These challenges are accompanied by food insecurity and threats to health and national security, and she stressed that “the future we deserve” demands deep-rooted, transformative and lasting change. “For this, we must redefine multilateral spaces,” she stressed, also calling for unbiased international partnerships that honour small islands’ strength and resilience — “systems that respect and include all of our voices”. Further, she urged those present to ground their decision-making in a critical assessment of “global historical patterns of disempowerment and exploitation, which constitutes progress for a few and underdevelopment for many”. She underscored: “It is time for all to prosper, regardless of size.”\nMOHAMED ALI NAFTI, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Migration and Tunisians Abroad of Tunisia, stated that “the global situation continues to deteriorate”, especially for countries in the Global South. This shows that international governance as envisaged at the end of the Second World War is incapable of addressing challenges and root causes. The international community must shore up multilateral mechanisms and reiterate commitment to the principles of the UN Charter and international law — “including by taking a new approach to international cooperation for the common well-being of nations on the basis of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs,” he said. Affirming support for the Pact for the Future and the Global Digital Compact, he called upon developed countries “to make good on their commitments for financing and for sustainable development and climate action”, doing so by helping developing countries to overcome debt.\nBADR AHMED MOHAMED ABDELATTY, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Emigration of Egypt, welcomed the adoption of the Pact of the Future, the Global Digital Compact and Pact for Global Generations, noting that with the exacerbation of global peace and security situations, there is a need for renewed commitment to the UN Charter and “not have double standards”. He reaffirmed his country’s trust in the international justice system, which, he observed, is tested by the international community’s impotence in resolving such issues. Egypt is committed to the territorial integrity of Somalia and Sudan, whose situations, among other things, highlight the need to reform the global financial architecture and address existing imbalances which have left people behind. Financing for development is key to prevent “additional burden on these countries”. His country promotes technological transfer by funding digital innovations and urges the global community to do everything to address water shortages and promote cooperation on climate matters. He endorsed the call for a total removal of nuclear weapons to guarantee the safety of current and future generations.\nMOHAMED MBAE, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Comoros, stressing the importance of renewing global solidarity, said sustainable development in least developed countries requires funding. Calling on the international community to adopt an innovative and ambitious funding mechanism, he said that young people and women must be adequately resourced. Universal social protection is crucial for protecting those who work in the informal labour market, he said, appealing to the countries of the North to implement the funding commitments they have made. Also stressing the need to build bridges and restore the UN’s authority, he called for “knowledge partnerships” and scientific and technological cooperation. The digital revolution must benefit everyone and must be guided by inclusivity, ethics and accountability, especially in sensitive areas such as artificial intelligence, he added.\nLEJEUNE MBELLA MBELLA, Minister for Foreign Relations of Cameroon, said that the Pact just adopted is “a real gamble” on peace, sustainable development and human dignity for current and future generations. Because of the specific actions contained therein, the Pact is a suitable way of “guiding us towards the future we wish to see, the future that we have defined together”, he said. However, its effective implementation requires immediate action and a demonstration of renewed political will. Stressing that the international community’s challenges are growing in number and complexity — “particularly, they have been globalized” — he said that the future of humankind must be defined in this ever-changing digital world. “Science and technology have indeed some of the best tools to achieve growth,” he observed, adding that the Pact brings these tools together “with unity, solidarity and humanity at its heart”.\nKI-HWAN KWEON, Deputy Minister for Multilateral and Global Affairs of the Republic of Korea, called for harnessing the key priority areas of science, technology, and innovation in a way that promotes and protects human rights and serves peaceful purposes. His Government is committed to advancing human-centred AI technology to drive progress. Following the “AI Seoul Summit” in May, the Republic of Korea convened the “AI Global Forum” to push for the establishment of AI norms in the private sector, and also hosted the “Responsible AI in the Military Domain Summit 2024”, presenting a comprehensive blueprint for military AI norms. He noted that in June, his delegation hosted an open debate on cybersecurity as President of the Security Council. Further, Seoul has consistently increased its official development assistance (ODA), with an expansion of over 30 per cent in 2024 compared to 2023, and pledges to continue to expand ODA to Africa up to $10 billion by 2030.\nThe representative of Israel said his county continues to face relentless attacks even as the Summit is under way, with hundreds of rockets fired into its territories. Israel will use all weapons at its disposal to protect its people. “We did not start this war, but we will protect our homes, our people and our nation,” he emphasized, stressing that the real story of Israel is that despite the immense challenges it faces, it utilizes technology for the advancement of human rights. He challenged the global community on how it can work towards eliminating poverty and how technology can be deployed to help humankind instead of spreading hate. “We cannot be paralysed by the enormity of this task,” he advised, noting that over the past year, antisemitism has escalated, but only through collective action can a lasting difference be made. Israel believes that it cannot leave a legacy of fear and terror for future generations. Noting that the challenges will not be easy to overcome, he called on the international community to come together, as “we can and we must meet our obligations”.\nThe representative of the Central African Republic said the Pact’s implementation is crucial for speeding up the achievement of the SDGs, preserving rights, peace and stability and improving global governance. The Pact is an invitation to leave behind the current deadlocked environment. Noting the lack of action over the last 30 years, whether in working groups or in intergovernmental negotiations, he said that it is crucial to reform the Security Council to repair the historic injustice done to Africa. “I hope this Pact will not turn into the umpteenth lost opportunity,” he said, adding that his country’s development has been limited due to internal challenges related to its security situation and its landlocked nature. The national development programme aims to build a prosperous country, and move from a situation of emergency to development. The international community must free up the funding necessary for countries such as his to achieve their aspirations, he said.\nThe representative of Austria spotlighted the many things agreed on in the Pact, including: establishing global cooperation on digital technology, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity; using the immense potential of space to drive sustainable development; accelerating climate commitments; and making concrete steps towards Security Council reform. He also noted that portions of the Pact reflect Austrian priorities, including: strengthening the rule of law and human rights; ensuring that nuclear weapons are never used again; and establishing legally binding regulation of autonomous weapons systems. Stressing that the solution for global challenges lies in cooperation, dialogue and partnership, he said that — “in this spirit” — Austria is a candidate for a non-permanent Council seat in 2026. He added that multilateralism “can only work with open minds”, urging delegations to come to the UN “not only to speak, but to listen”.\nALEKSANDAR VUČIĆ, President of Serbia, stated that it is incredible how the world’s most powerful countries “brutally violate the law of the United Nations, and more than anything, peace”. In justifying their “big politics”, those States “speak about the just peace, which means that they should win, and that the other ones not only should lose, but they should be completely destroyed.” While voicing support for the Pact for the Future, he called for more compromise for developing countries. He further cited the need for balance between the Western point of view on the issue of the rule of law on one side, and the demands of numerous countries when it comes to family and traditional values. While Serbia is a modern country, it is not ready to sacrifice its own traditional values, and “it will be capable of resisting all the attempts from the outside that the so-called woke movement is imposing,” he stated.\nWILLIAM SAMOEI RUTO, President of Kenya and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces, said the call for bold reforms of the UN system to address rapidly evolving and increasingly complex global challenges is even more urgent today, adding that “without immediate action, humanity will face an unprecedented global crisis”. There is therefore a need to redesign the international financial system, strengthen partnerships for common security, bridge the digital divide, and invest in human capacity, especially to empower women and youth. He called for action to address the historical injustice of Africa’s lack of permanent representation on the Security Council in addition to region-led peace operations, sustainably funded by UN-assessed contributions. Highlighting Kenya’s contribution of troops to Haiti in support of the international security mission in that country and the ongoing success thereof, he noted that “what looked like mission impossible is now a present and real possibility for peace in Haiti”. Further, he called for a reform of the currently inadequate multilateral institutional framework.\nGITANAS NAUSĖDA, President of Lithuania, calling on the international community to limit the Russian Federation’s ability to continue its colonial policies, expressed regret about the lack of a multilateral response to that country’s invasion of Ukraine. “The United Nations must be empowered to stop and contain both present and future aggressors,” he stressed. Noting that lack of resources poses a key obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, he said it is vital to create a global financial architecture that is “more equitable, just and responsive to crisis”. Turning to the climate crisis, he called for more investment into renewable energy. Highlighting the need to address challenges related to new and emerging technologies, he drew attention to the Council of Europe’s adoption of the first-ever Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law.\nFILIPE JACINTO NYUSI, President of Mozambique, said that multilateralism is “a safe vehicle to pursue our common global agenda”. It is not just a choice; rather, it is an imperative for addressing complex challenges. Multilateral engagement is needed to implement the 2030 Agenda, he stressed, also underlining the need for a new international financial architecture that responds to the global challenges of poverty and underdevelopment. Multilateralism, he said, is the best tool with which to address humanity’s complex, multiple challenges, and it is urgent to restore peoples’ confidence in international institutions and inclusive international law. Spotlighting Africa’s youth, hardworking population, diversity and potential, he underscored that — if the international community is serious about promoting global prosperity — “it would be a total collapse” to exclude Africa “from the most-important circles of decision-making”.\nGORDANA SILJANOVSKA-DAVKOVA, President of the Republic of North Macedonia, said that “decorative, or cosmetic reforms of the UN, with a status quo philosophy, or ‘flying without moving’, is not enough” — change must be structural, functional meritocratic, and democratic. Voicing support for a stronger role for the International Court of Justice, she affirmed that its judgments must become binding for everyone. As a representative of a small country, she called for increased participation for those States in the Security Council. “Moreover, an end should be put to the disrespect, bypassing and selective application of the Charter, as in the Macedonian case,” she said. As her country’s first female President, “I fiercely advocate for more women in the highest positions, and I am personally fulfilling these commitments,” she stressed.\nThe summary of the statement by Carlos Manuel Vila Nova, President of Sao Tome and Principe, is not available due to the lack of interpretation.\nROBINAH NABBANJA, Prime Minister and Leader of Government Business in Parliament of Uganda, observed that major challenges caused by the “current unfair international economic order for developing countries have reached their most acute expression in current times”. The Pact she hoped does not become “another futile exercise, but must garner political will and commitment across all levels of global leadership to pragmatically address current issues and lay a foundation for solutions for our future global progress and challenges”. The anticipated future must offer opportunities and capacity for the Global South to catch up, a project which will require the international community’s commitment to practically implement all the agreed actions in the Pact for the Future. Uganda is committed to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Global Digital Compact, causing it to initiate an Annual Global Dialogue on Artificial Intelligence Governance under UN auspices, as well as an inclusive process towards international data governance arrangements, she added.\nFIAMĒ NAOMI MATA'AFA, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Samoa, said that “small island States are not mere dots on a map, we are vibrant symphonies of life, rich with history and culture.” Saving the smallest and most vulnerable is tantamount to saving the world, she stressed, adding: “First and foremost, we must confront climate change.” Coastal erosion and rising sea levels are not distant concerns for countries such as hers, she said, calling on the international community to “breathe life into the Paris Agreement”.\n“Beyond the immediate threats of climate change lies an economic tempest of its own,” she said, pointing to the swelling tide of debt, economic fluctuations and external shocks. The reform of the international financial architecture to correct deeply entrenched imbalances is essential. Turning to artificial intelligence and digital technologies, she said while these can be a gamechanger, small island developing States face significant access barriers. Calling for assistance in bridging this digital gap, she said the international community must “share best practices and unlock new opportunities.”\nJUSTIN TRUDEAU, Prime Minister of Canada, noted global instability, the increasingly dire costs of climate change, rising inequality, eroding human rights and humanitarian crises. “On the one hand, we can bury our heads in the sand, eschewing multilateralism in favour of short-sighted self-interest, or we can recognize that, collectively, we have a responsibility to set our differences aside,” he said. For its part, Canada is working to build a generation where everyone “has a real and fair shot”, and he emphasized that the solution to peoples’ angst “is not to deceive and deflect”, but to act. Therefore, the Government is working towards affordable child care, nutritious school meals, an ambitious housing plan, a national dental-care programme and a growth strategy that creates well-paying, community-building, middle-class jobs. However, noting that “climate change and inflation don’t stop at borders”, he said that the international community must together tackle the great global challenges working within institutions such as the United Nations.\nFELETI TEO, Prime Minister of Tuvalu, noted that his country is a small Pacific atoll island nation, and also a large ocean State. Tuvalu “carries the firm belief that we are only temporary stewards and caretakers of the ocean and the environment on behalf of future generations.” However, he warned, “the ocean that used to define us as a people and as a community and as a nation, will soon engulf us if sea-level rise is not halted or the resilience of our land territory to sea-level rise is not reinforced.” Tuvalu contributed negligibly, if at all, to the cause of climate change, and “that is how grossly unfair and inequitable the world we live in today” is, he said — with States that benefit the most from fossil fuel extraction accelerating their development and prosperity “at the expense of the most vulnerable States, which are left well and truly behind”.\nDANIEL RISCH, Prime Minister, Minister for General Government Affairs and Minister for Finance of Liechtenstein, said his countrymen expect the United Nations to be the guardian of peace and security. He lamented that five States hold the veto power in the Security Council and can block any decision, even when supported by an overwhelming majority of the international community. He particularly highlighted the “level of absurdity” of the Russian Federation — a veto-wielding member — “far from acting as a guardian of the international order”, engaging in a blatant and far-reaching aggression against another State, thus “violating the core principles of our common organization”. He urged Member States to stand against those attempting to roll back history, adding that by presenting the veto initiative, Liechtenstein has ensured “that a veto in the Council is no longer the last word”. He encouraged the Secretary-General to play a more proactive role and to use the UN’s unique authority to mediate, prevent and address conflicts.\nRALPH E. GONSALVES, Prime Minister and Minister for National Security, Legal Affairs and Information of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, noting that the multilateral system has been ill for a long time, said the international community is now poised to make “some surgical incisions” that hopefully can lead to healing. Highlighting the current deficit of trust and recent geopolitical tensions, he said everyone is aware of the litany of vulnerabilities that small island developing States face as well as the historic issues that caused their legacies of underdevelopment. Stressing the need to reform the outdated international financial architecture, he said countries such as his have to deal with the “millstone of crushing debt”. “Truth be told, the developed countries have been making a lot of promises to us and breaking them cynically,” he said, adding that the international community needs to take more ambitious action to address the climate crisis. “Otherwise, all of us here are going to go to hell in a handbasket; you know it and I know it,” he added.\nMIHAI POPȘOI, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Moldova, emphasized that the Russian Federation has waged a war of aggression against Ukraine — “in the middle of Europe” — for more than two years. Condemning such aggression, he expressed support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and rejected any threat or use of force against any State — “which should have no place in international relations”. He also stated that the Russian Federation’s aggressive policy “generates significant negative effects” for his country, including hybrid threats such as cyberattacks, misinformation campaigns, disruptions to public order and meddling in electoral processes. Underlining his Government’s commitment to achieve a peaceful settlement in the Transnistria region, he said that this will include the evacuation of foreign troops and munitions and a consolidation of independence and State sovereignty. He also urged that the Pact not become “just another UN document that is adopted and forgotten”.\nSALEUMXAY KOMMASITH, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lao People’s Democratic Republic, voiced concern over the increased SDG financing gap, citing “the urgency to provide predictable, sustainable, and adequate development finance from diverse sources to developing countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable ones”. He called for actionable financing frameworks, including the SDG Stimulus, ODA, and private sector investments. Welcoming the adoption of the Global Digital Compact, he expressed support for bridging the science, technology and innovation divides. With 60 per cent of the total population of his country under the age of 30, it “has one of the youngest demographics in South-East Asia, presenting a significant opportunity for economic and social development through the engagement of young people”, he stated. He further called for urgent reform of international financial institutions “so they can be more inclusive and reflective of today's economic needs and political realities”.\nGUYLAIN NYEMBO MBWIZYA NYEMBO MBWIZYA, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Planning and Development Aid Coordination of the Democratic Republic of Congo, said poverty and hunger, conflicts, and the rise of extremism in the world offer a window of opportunity for a better tomorrow. When the UN was conceived 78 years ago nothing suggested that the future would be presented with such a scenario in which its essence would be called into question. The Pact for the Future is an “excellent opportunity for the global community to embrace a new paradigm”, he noted, adding that room should be given for action and the safeguarding of humanity’s common good for the planet. The Democratic Republic of Congo is therefore undertaking massive investments in education, health care, women’s empowerment, research and technological innovation, he announced, observing that there will be no envisaged future if Africa does not have its rightful place in the Organization with two permanent Security Council seats, or there is no adequate financing for the SDGs. There will be no real future as well without climate justice or “when we can still hear weapons being fired”, he said.\nALICIA BÁRCENA IBARRA, Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico, said the Summit is a good moment to acknowledge the crisis of legitimacy that the United Nations is facing. Highlighting her country’s commitment to serve as a bridge between different schools of thought, she added that since 1945, the world has changed radically, from new technologies to shifting centres of power. Multilateralism must overcome “nationalist partial views”, she said, highlighting the need to respect the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. Noting proposals made by her country during negotiations for the Pact, she said they were aimed at moving towards substantive gender equality and addressing environmental degradation, among others. “We want the world to be inclusive and representative,” she said, stressing the need for Council reform, including elimination of the veto.\nABDULLATIF BIN RASHID AL ZAYANI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain, underlined the need to work towards fair and sustainable development, wider access to science and technology for all countries, youth empowerment, cooperation to end conflicts and support for the principles of international law. For its part, Bahrain worked to ensure that the thirty-third Arab Summit — which it hosted in May — would result in a “valuable outcome”. There, “all Arab leaders agreed on the need to end the Israeli-Arab conflict” by implementing a two-State solution and establishing a sovereign, viable Palestinian State, he recalled. He also noted support for Palestine’s full UN membership. Further recalling commitments expressed during the Summit to counter the “wider humanitarian and political challenges facing our world”, he detailed several initiatives such as those aimed at providing increased access to health care and education for those affected by conflict.\nYUSUF MAITAMA TUGGAR, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, noted that only about 16 per cent of SDG targets are on track to be achieved, calling for “real willingness to fulfill outstanding commitments with the remaining 84 per cent of the SDG targets for 2030. He outlined a list of priorities, including reform of the Security Council to ensure a permanent seat for Africa, along with reform of international financial architecture to promote an inclusive non-discriminatory and transparent international trading system. Further, it is crucial to support local Indigenous production and export from Africa and strengthen measures to ensure timely repatriation of illicit financial flows and assets. Calling for adoption of a UN framework convention on international tax cooperation, he urged the international community to commit to bridging the digital divide between the Global North and South through technology sharing and capacity-building, including in areas such as artificial intelligence.\nALBERT SHINGIRO, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Development Cooperation of Burundi, noting the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, wars, geostrategic positioning and trade tensions, said the world today seems to be walking further away from the ideals of peace and security. Collective rules are regularly flouted, leading to muscle diplomacy. Wondering what can consequently be expected other than the weakening of multilateralism and greater inequality with the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer, he nevertheless urged the international community to not become discouraged but tackle these problems today and spare future generations from the scourge of war. He called for recent international agreements to be respected in the areas of digital security, the fight against exclusion and reform of global governance architecture. Burundi is committed to the Pact for the Future. However, signing and implementing a pact are different things. He therefore underscored the need for joint political will, respect for commitment at all levels and the salvaging of multilateralism, adding that the Pact must not be another document but a “kind of compass which guides us together into a peaceful, inclusive and prosperous world to benefit current and future generations”.\nHUSSEIN AWAD ALI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sudan, stressing the importance of reforming the United Nations, said all countries must adhere to the United Nations Charter. The international community must avoid highlighting some principles of the Charter while ignoring others. Stressing the importance of respecting State sovereignty, territorial integrity and ensuring non-use of force, he said that there are double standards in their implementation. “Certain legal mechanisms are used to achieve political objectives,” he said, pointing to the challenges posed by sanctions on countries such as his. Also calling for reform of the international financial architecture, he said technology transfer is vital.\nCARLOS PINTO PEREIRA, Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and Communities of Guinea-Bissau, said that his country — “as does all countries in development” — faces significant poverty, food insecurity and the negative effects of climate change. Yet, with the support of the international community, “we can implement innovative solutions that will benefit not only our country, but the region and the world”, he emphasized. Stressing that education is the basis for a more-prosperous future, he said that all children must be able to access learning. Youth — “the force of our future” and the “leaders of tomorrow”, he noted — must be given the opportunities and tools necessary to fully contribute to their societies. Further, they must be involved in decision-making processes. The Summit of the Future, he concluded, is a “turning point”, during which concrete measures can be adopted to ensure that “all countries — independent of size and economic growth — can have a say in our common future”.\nABDOULAYE DIOP, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mali, citing the “cowardly terrorist acts” of 17 September in his country, reaffirmed its commitment to the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States, and the sovereign equality of States. He called on the international community to “act together to renew our commitment for thoroughgoing change to the multilateral system that has governed world affairs up until now”. In this regard, it is essential that decisions “meet the aspirations of our peoples, particularly those of the Global South”. It is also essential to mobilize the courage to proceed to reform multilateral institutions, particularly the Security Council and international financial institutions, “in order to adapt them to the realities of our time, so that they are more inclusive, more just, but above all more representative”, he stated.\nRAMADAN ABDALLAH MOHAMMED GOC, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity of South Sudan, said his country, as a young nation still recovering from crises, is committed to create a future of peace and dignity for all. He called upon the international community to support efforts for peace, dialogue and reconciliation in his country and everywhere else. Highlighting climate change as one of the most urgent threats with dire effects in South Sudan, he called for solidarity in addressing this issue by investing in agriculture, renewable energy and environmental conservation to secure a resilient future for the people of the world. He said his country is committed to empowering its young people and diversification of its economy, also seeking partnerships that encourage inclusive economic growth, job creation and infrastructure development. He further expressed his Government’s commitment to creating a world where all people have opportunity to thrive.\nThe representative of the African Union said the international community must embrace solidarity instead of hostility, respect instead of scorn and sharing instead of exclusion. Unfortunately, in recent times, multilateralism has been eclipsed by unilateralism and power struggle, he said, rejecting this approach and stressing the need to renew State confidence in multilateralism. The Union has defended this policy, he said, adding that the actions recommended by the Pact, particularly the Global Digital Compact, are in line with the aspirations of its 2063 Agenda. The implementation of the action plans created by the Union has been hobbled significantly by the scarcity of financing, he said. “Let’s hope the wealthy keep their promises this time,” he said.\nDIANA ELENA MONDINO, Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship of Argentina, said that her country “has decided to operate a society where people are responsible for their actions, but can act in freedom”. Further, the Government wants to address the challenges of terrorism and threats to democracy, international security and economic development and, in this, takes as its guide the Charter of the United Nations. Deviations from the purposes and principles of that instrument “create problems”, she emphasized — “not just for a given country, that loses its own freedom, but also for those countries interacting with that country”. Reporting that her country has conducted a “realistic diagnosis” and begun a serious reform process, she said that Argentina will open to the world and commit “to be one of the freest countries of the international community”. She also pointed out that the Pact consists of non-legally binding aspirations, which every State can interpret autonomously.\nThe representative of the International Development Law Organization affirmed that the rule of law is critical to rebuilding public trust, as “the unmet demand for justice is at the root of multiple crises around the globe”. The rule of law helps ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency, while people-centred justice systems protect the rights of the least powerful and give people confidence that institutions are working in the interest of all rather than a privileged few. “The inclusion of women, youth and other historically excluded groups is essential for the whole-of-society approaches needed for lasting peace and sustainable development,” she stated. Further, the rule of law is key to reinvigorating and repurposing multilateralism for the twenty-first century. She emphasized that at the international level, as enshrined in the UN Charter, the rule of law guarantees the sovereign equality of Member States and is the basis for the preservation of international peace and security.\nThe representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) wondered how people outside the General Assembly Hall would receive the Pact. He highlighted the Programme’s efforts on sustainable development financing and its support for countries, also shaping new SDG financing. UNDP’s global support continually provides a pathway for people to enjoy clean water, digital technologies and have hope for the future, he said.\nThe representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that health is not created in clinics and hospitals; it is created in streets and homes and schools and communities and parliaments. When people need care, they must be able to access health services when and where they need it without facing financial hardships, he stressed. The WHO pandemic agreement offers a shared approach to shared threats, he said, adding that it does not give his organization any undue sovereignty giving it the power to impose lockdowns or vaccine mandates. “This is fake information,” he said, adding that the agreement is being negotiated by Member States, and will be implemented in full accordance with national laws. Highlighting WHO’s efforts to meet the health needs of refugees and host communities in Sudan, he added: “But what the people of Sudan, Gaza and Ukraine need more than aid is a ceasefire”. There is no health without paece and no peace without health.\nThe representative of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), stating that “today, multilateralism received a boost”, said that the agency is committed to supporting the Summit’s outcome by focusing on practical solutions to respond to conflict and crisis, deliver sustainable development and advance climate action. Further, UNOPS is ready to leverage its experience in infrastructure, procurement and project management to “bridge the gap that exists between ambitions and reality on the ground”, he said. Stressing that “our future hangs in the balance”, he urged collective, responsible and decisive action to deliver peace and prosperity for both people and planet.\nThe representative of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) recalled that “the landmark outcomes of all major conferences this year are telling us the same story: To achieve the SDGs, developing countries need to invest in transforming their economies and industrialize.” He noted that countries that do industrialize are making the biggest strides in poverty eradication, ending hunger and wealth creation, emphasizing that “every job in manufacturing creates on average 2.5 jobs in other sectors of the economy”. He pointed out that industry is already a driver of green innovation today, with industrial firms holding nearly 60 per cent of green patents globally. Calling on the Summit to help to set standards for the global economy, he insisted that “fair and sustainable supply chains are a must”. In addition to flagship initiatives on industrial deep decarbonization and green hydrogen, he noted that UNIDO has launched new ones such as the Global Alliance and Partnership for Responsible and Green Minerals.\nThe representative of the Sovereign Order of Malta said the global community should never lose sight of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society, as “‘leaving no one behind’ must represent an imperative for the whole international community”. No economic and social progress can occur without the strengthening of multilateral cooperation centred around the UN. He renewed his appeal for respecting international humanitarian law, and highlighted Ukraine and Gaza as recipients of his country’s most significant emergency operations. The Sovereign Order attaches utmost importance to the goal of promoting and safeguarding religious freedoms, religions and dialogues amongst them, as the work of faith-based organizations can be powerful vehicles of conflict mediation, social advancement, and sustainable development. “Together, we can accelerate progress towards a future where dignity, human rights, access to health and education are realities for all, leaving no one behind,” he said.\nThe representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said that the international community can help refugees and internally displaced persons shape their future — “especially those for whom it brings fear as much as hope”. The doors of schools and clinics must be opened to such individuals “so that they can contribute to the communities hosting them while we work together to find solutions to their plight”, he urged. All stakeholders should work towards a vision where refugees are seen as an opportunity — not a burden — he stressed, and one where such individuals “can think of a future in which they are not refugees”.\nThe representative of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) stated that “there can be no sustainable future, no economic stability without a healthy environment” — requiring a shift to a world in which humanity lives in harmony with nature, with healthy lands, water and oceans, with stable climate, free of pollution. She called on humanity to sustainably and equitably use resources, pointing to commitments already made to deliver that shift in many multilateral agreements. Citing the three planetary crisis — climate change, nature and biodiversity loss and desertification, and pollution and waste, she pointed to negotiations on an instrument to end plastic pollution. The Programme calls on all Member States “to do their utmost to forge a strong impactful agreement and quickly move to the adoption, ratification and implementation to deliver on all agreements and strengthen sustainable development”.\nThe representative of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) said the delivery of the Pact for the Future by Member States has “sent a powerful message to the world that our future is digital — that we can and must write it together”, adding that, as the UN agency for digital technologies, ITU “will be with you every step of the way”. She noted that digital divides can no longer be tolerated in an age of unimaginable digital opportunities, with one third of humanity still unconnected — without a voice. Radio-frequency spectrum and associated satellite orbit resources must therefore be shared equitably and sustainably for all of humanity as well as strengthening of international standards. “As we look to 2030, let’s turn the vision of the Pact for the Future and its Global Digital Compact into a lasting reality”, she encouraged, calling for a redoubling of efforts to advance universal meaningful connectivity and sustainable digital transformation.\nThe representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), spotlighting the more than 730 million people worldwide who faced hunger in 2023, underscored that the international community is “not on track to achieve any of the global SDG targets”. Huge inequality persists, and the future will be determined by the emergence of more-equitable agrifood systems. Urging a focus on innovative, cost-effective investment to achieve the 2030 Agenda, he said that “hunger can be defeated” through collaboration and by leveraging comparative advantages.\nThe representative of the Council of Europe stressed that its “current priority is to support Ukraine, which is one of our Member States. At the beginning of the year, the register of damage became fully operational - a register that receives contributions for the loss and damage caused by the war of aggression waged by the Russian Federation. This is a first tool, but absolutely necessary as a step toward an international mechanism for compensation. “We will play a key role when it comes to any tribunal aiming to judge the crime of aggression,” he stated, noting the Council will work to implement a plan of action for resilience, recovery and reconstruction. The European Convention of the European Court human rights is the only international jurisdiction that as of now has ruled on human rights violations in the context of the war, but he pointed to other tools — including the Istanbul Convention to Prevent and Combat Domestic Violence and Violence Against Women.\nDAREN TANG, a representative of the World Intellectual Property Organization, reminding the Summit that “it is often in times of crises that we are at our most innovative” urged Member States to not lose hope. The power of human invention, innovation and creativity must be harnessed to build a more resilient, prosperous and sustainable future. As intellectual property shifts from a technical area of interest only to experts to an increasingly important cornerstone of economic and trade policy, and a catalyst for growth and development, WIPO is transforming the global intellectual property regime so that it is more inclusive and vibrant. Noting that intellectual property is not just about technical laws, but also a catalyst for progress, opportunity, and sustainability, he expressed WIPO’s pledge to work with everyone to harness the power of innovation and creativity to support the aims of the Summit.\nThe representative of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that successive generations of people have moved in search of a better life — “and we know many more will move in the future”. Investing in safe, regular and orderly pathways for migration can help reduce irregular migration, accelerate inclusive growth, strengthen decent work, bridge demographic shifts and labour gaps and foster sustainable development, she emphasized. She added that all States share a collective responsibility to protect and respect the human rights of all migrants, underlining IOM’s commitment to support people on the move.\nThe representative of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean announced concrete initiatives including the creation of a permanent Parliamentary Observatory of the Global South for the SDGs, based in and managed by Morocco. He further cited the creation of a permanent Global Parliamentary Observatory on the misuse of AI and emerging technologies that will be a platform for monitoring, analyzing and promoting effective legislation principles and criteria “so that these tools are not used by terrorists and criminal groups for their own malicious purposes but for the benefit of all humanity”.\nThe representative of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said the future to be inherited by the next generation “depends on the choices we now make”. Observing that of the region’s 53 members, only one remains low-income, and five of the original 14 least developed countries remain so at the end of the decade, she said ESCAP’s trajectory towards sustainable development, despite being uneven, has been an undeniable success. However, a future with even greater possibilities “calls for a transformative change to this model of development”, she quickly pointed out. The region must reduce its carbon emissions by all possible means and maximize its human resources. She stressed the critical need to create an equitable social security system and address financing gaps with debt servicing and mobilization of private sector investment. The region’s youth, she said, must “see possibilities, participate in decision-making and seize opportunities before them”.\nThe representative of the Economic Commission for Europe, stressing that “we are doing this for the children”, said the international community must invest in education. When the youth of today have to take decisions tomorrow, they will know to put environmental and social concerns before economic or political gains. Underscoring the need for an inclusive approach, she said the actions to implement the Pact will need to be taken by people of all ages, by women and men, by communities, by local and regional authorities. “They are on the front lines,” she said, adding that States must enable them, trust them and partner with them.\nThe representative of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria stressed that, in a world where about 4.5 billion people are not fully covered by essential health services, “now is not the time to shy away from commitments” to bolster progress towards universal health coverage. Global health must stay at the centre of the international agenda, and she welcomed the Pact’s focus on climate change as “the biggest global health challenge of our time”. The phenomenon is destabilizing the foundations of human health, deepening inequality and leading to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Noting that the Global Fund is an “example of partnership powered by equity”, she expressed hope for broadened multilateralism to create a healthier and more peaceful world.\nThe representative of the Latin America and Caribbean Development Bank said multilateral banks and regional ones need to be strengthened at all levels to meet current challenges. Therefore, the international financial architecture must be efficient in deploying greater resources to achieve sustainable development, he said, noting that the Global South requires “differentiated approaches and innovative flexible solutions” with appropriate financing. With greater capital, his Bank would be able to increase resources as a reliable channel to tackle specific challenges. “We will continue in our role to assist countries by optimizing their tax systems, easing their debt burdens and increasing investment,” he committed.\nThe representative of the International Labour Organization (ILO) said the world needs a more equitable distribution of economic resources and universal access to social protection. In order to achieve this, it is crucial to involve non-State actors such as workers’ and employers’ organizations. Citing his organization’s constitution, he added that social justice is imperative to lasting peace. Noting that the Pact calls for global governance reform and financing for development, he reminded delegates that in 2023, 20 per cent of young people were neither in employment or education or training. Further, 3.8 billion people have no access to any single social protection, he said, reaffirming his organization’s commitment to a more equitable world.\nThe representative of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation underlined the need for enhanced, revitalized global partnerships to address shared resourcing and investment gaps in implementing the 2030 Agenda. Noting that each region has its own cultural, economic and environmental context, he said that it is essential to “tailor our approaches to fit these diverse landscapes”. Further, the resources available must be increased by combining traditional development assistance with innovative financing solutions. “The linkage between global prosperity and South Asia cannot be overemphasized,” he concluded, spotlighting the region’s “immense potential for global prosperity”.\nThe representative of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia said the Summit represents a moment of introspection for the global community, adding that interactions among nations with diverse backgrounds within environments of trust, mutual respect, and equal footing contribute to the SDGs. His organization’s Conference on Environmental Issues, held in August, adopted a high-level statement that reflects Member States’ dedication to advancing collaboration in addressing critical environmental issues. In December, the partnership network of the Conference’s leading universities will be established at the Ministerial Council Meeting in Baku. He highlighted the crucial nature of organizations like his to addressing global challenges at the regional level, opining that “together, we can build a resilient and sustainable future”.\nThe representative of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization said it is an association of 26 countries with various statuses and represents over half the population of the world, as well as a quarter of its surface area. The organization is committed to “the principle of openness and the Shanghai spirit”, which means mutual trust, respect for cultural diversity and striving for development, he said. Rejecting a confrontational or bloc-based approach, he said that given the tectonic changes in global policies at the moment, the best response is to unify efforts to shape a more representative, democratic and multipolar world.\nThe representative of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) pointed out that 21 African countries are either in — or at high risk of — debt distress. Basic social expenditures are being crowded out, there is limited access to long-term concessional finance and unprecedented climate effects cost up to 5 per cent of Africa’s annual gross domestic product (GDP). “Yet, we cannot attract sufficient investments” because the rules of engagement do not favour Africa, he reported, noting that Africa’s borrowing costs are four times higher than the United States’ and more than four times higher than Germany’s. Stressing that “justice for Africa cannot be served” by an outdated global financial architecture, he also called for an international tax cooperation framework to be finalized and implemented.\nThe representative of the International Olympic Committee said that despite geopolitical tensions, the Committee was able to bring athletes from all around the world, including refugees, to the Olympic games, during which they all lived peacefully, eating together without any form of discrimination. These athletes “created a culture of peace, showing how our world would be if we all were to live in the Olympic spirit of peaceful coexistence”, he said, highlighting that this was the first Olympic games with full gender parity, and with a record number of 37 refugee participants winning their first-ever Olympic medal. He revealed that the 2024 games in Paris emitted 50 per cent less carbon dioxide emissions than past games. The Committee is promoting the role of sport as an important enabler and accelerator of the SDGs and is ready to strengthen the contribution of sports in the framework of the Pact for the Future because the Pact “perfectly reflects our Olympic motto: faster, higher, stronger together”, he concluded.\nThe representative of the Inter-American Development Bank said the current pivotal moment demands “youthful energy and relentless pursuit of dreams”. Climate change is fueling biodiversity loss, creating “a horrible feedback loop”, as exemplified by historic drought in the Amazon. It is essential to turn challenges into opportunities, he said, adding that the international community must embrace innovative solutions to build the foundation for growth and prosperity.\nThe representative of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) emphasized that “there is hardly anything new in the Pact that we have not committed ourselves to in the past under the UN and other frameworks.” For ECOWAS, the difference between the Pact for the Future and earlier global agreements will lie in delivering on commitments in the areas of peace and security, sustainable socioeconomic development, climate change and climate justice, as well as youth empowerment. “It will also mean concrete action to promote and support our regional unity not our disunity, our integration not our disintegration, and a commitment not to turn Africa, especially West Africa into a zone of proxy conflicts,” he stressed. Another failure will mean that “history will look back to this summit not as the summit of the future but a summit of the past.”\nThe representative of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) said today was “a defining moment in human history”. In leading the Arab region through an era of rapid global change, the Commission is integrating intelligent technologies and foresight methodologies into policymaking processes, transforming how Governments forecast trends, assess risks, and make informed decisions that are proactive rather than reactive. Through advanced policy simulation tools and data-driven insights, “we are equipping our member States to design policies that are not only resilient and inclusive, but also aligned with the long-term aspirations of their people,” she said. The Commission will champion the development of inclusive digital economies that empower youth and women, driving the economic diversification essential for the region’s long-term stability and prosperity. “This is our moment to act with vision, to lead with courage, and to turn the promise of the Pact for the Future into a reality,” she stated.\nThe representative of the Common Fund for Commodities noted that “commodities are the lifeblood of many economies” — especially in developing nations, where billions of smallholder farmers at the lowest income levels depend on commodities and commodity-related jobs for their livelihoods. Commodities have the potential to fuel sustainable economic growth, generate jobs and provide vital revenues, while paving the way for a greener, more equitable world. However, when mismanaged, these very commodities can become sources of environmental devastation, social injustice and economic fragility. “Therefore, it is our moral duty to ensure that justice and ethics are woven into every step of the commodity value chain, transforming them into forces that uplift societies,” he stated. The Fund has supported 127 projects in least developed countries alone, with a total value of about $189 million and the direct contribution of $105 million, improving the livelihoods of countless farmers and smallholders.\nThe representative of the African Development Bank Group, highlighting the establishment of the Africa Credit Rating Agency, said the global financial system does not protect his continent from the contagious effects of world-wide economic shocks. Africa is the only region of the world without a financial safety net, he said, adding that it is critical to establish a financial stability mechanism to address this. Also drawing attention to the need to deploy risk instruments at scale to bring more investments to Africa, he said this is essential to tackle the rising insecurity.\nThe representative of the United Nations Capital Development Fund stated that the SDG financing gap continues to widen, threatening to leave behind those below the poverty line, particularly in least developed countries, small island nations and many other fragile settings. The Fund is “the only UN fund capable of deploying inclusive blended finance solutions at the pace and scale needed to crowd in private streams of finance at the last mile,” he said. It responds to this call by enhancing its unique capabilities to amplify the impact of the UN system and the wider development community. As a non-credit rated hybrid development and finance institution, the Fund is designed to absorb and reduce the high risks that make access to sustainable capital simply unattainable, catalysing investments that otherwise would be unbankable. “You can see the impact is felt in fragile developing countries around the world today,” he stated.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias is on the campaign trail, and he has agreed to meet me to talk about his run for U.S. Senate. He smiles widely as he thrusts his hand out to meet mine in a firm, confident handshake. No doubt he’s had plenty of time to perfect that movement since taking office in 2006 at the politically-young age of 29.\n“We’ve got to be in the Quad Cities by four,” he says, explaining why he’s ordering a quick slice of candy-encrusted cheesecake instead of a more healthy dinner. “Don’t tell my mother,” he says.\nHe is a man with style. His modern clean-cut suits and fine French cuffs help reinforce the persona of confidence and competence that he has cultivated during his time in Springfield. “I think I’m a pretty regular guy,” he says, showing the Hartmarx label on his Chicago-made suit. “I’ve always believed in looking professional. Even when you’re not at work, it’s important to look presentable….My days of going to the movies in sweatpants are over.”\nGiannoulias is leaving behind more than the comfort of sweatpants. He’s leaving the Illinois Statehouse, pinning his hopes on a bigger dream in a bigger Capitol. He is running for the U.S. Senate seat once held by friend and basketball foe President Barack Obama, and he will need more than just his style and understated swagger to land in Washington, D.C.\nBanking, basketball and Obama\nAlexander “Alexi” Giannoulias, the son of Greek immigrants and the youngest of three boys, grew up in Chicago. He recalls how his father, Alexis Giannoulias, would not let the boys watch television, instead giving them piles of National Geographic magazines to read. The elder Giannoulias worked various jobs in retail and real estate before founding Broadway Bank in 1978 in the upscale Chicago neighborhood of Edgewater. The family business grew to be one of Chicago’s most successful community banks, a fact that continues to shape the youngest Giannoulias’ life even now.\nIn some respects, Giannoulias owes much of his success so far to basketball. It was on the basketball court, in between school at the University of Chicago and working part-time at the family bank, that he met Barack Obama, then a state senator with a competitive streak, on the court. Giannoulias left Chicago to play ball at Boston University before moving to Greece for a year to play professionally, but he didn’t forget Obama. He returned to the U.S. to attend law school at Tulane University in New Orleans, but it was back in Chicago, managing loans at the family bank, that their relationship developed into more than mere gym buddies.\nGiannoulias worked hard to promote Obama when Obama ran for U.S. Senate, raising money and drumming up support everywhere he went. When Obama won the Senate race, he rewarded Giannoulias’ efforts with a shining endorsement as the young banker sought the state treasurer’s office. While their relationship has sometimes been characterized as a mutual back-scratching arrangement, Giannoulias says that’s not the case.\n“I supported him when he ran for U.S. Senate because he’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, someone who understands and connects with people and genuinely believes in public service,” Giannoulias says. “When I ran for treasurer, I had to convince him why I was running, of what I wanted to do in this office, and that I had the experience to turn this office around. It wasn’t until I did that that he endorsed my candidacy.\n“Is he a friend? Yes. Is he a mentor to me? Yes. He’s one of the reasons I ran for office in the first place, but we both believe in public service.”\nGiannoulias has used much of his time in the treasurer’s office expediently. On his very first day on the job, he followed through with a campaign promise to ban campaign contributions from any company doing business with his office, earning him valuable marks on ethics in a state beleaguered by scandal. He installed the popular Green Rewards program, which gave tax rebates for hybrid vehicle purchases, and turned the state’s weak college savings fund, Bright Start, into one of the nation’s best. He scored points with military families by creating a scholarship for children who lost a parent in the line of duty, put pressure on banks to save jobs, and created the Cash Dash program to help Illinoisans claim lost bank boxes. He even created an eBay account for the state to auction contents of those unclaimed bank boxes.\nThrough all of this, he has made the office of treasurer relevant to the average Joe while also making a name for himself.\nOn top of the world\nGiannoulias has raised a lot of cash in the Senate race — most of it, in fact. According to the Federal Election Commission, he has reported raising $3 million to date, meaning he controls 56 percent of all money raised in the Democrat race for U.S. Senate. That gives him a $2 million buffer between himself and the next largest Democrat fundraiser, Jacob Meister, who has just over $1 million. Meister only garners 1 percent of support in voter polls, however, making him more of a footnote than a threat.\nGiannoulias’ only real competition in raising campaign cash is Republican Mark Kirk, U.S. representative from Chicago’s North Shore, who also reported raising nearly $3 million. This fact won’t truly come into play until after the primary, and that’s assuming both Giannoulias and Kirk make the cut.\nNot only does Giannoulias dominate the Democrat field in fundraising, but the vast majority of his campaign money reportedly comes from individual donors. Just 2 percent of Giannoulias’ funding comes from the Democratic party and political action committees — registered groups formed to promote specific candidates or causes, sometimes seen as disproportionately powerful. The rest comes from more than 2,200 individual donations. PACs have contributed only $50,000 to Giannoulias’ campaign, and he denies taking any money at all from corporate PACs, giving him the ability to claim independence from powerful corporate lobbying interests.\nCash isn’t the only thing Giannoulias has going for him. His list of endorsements is 166 names long and contains U.S. representatives, state senators and representatives, Chicago aldermen, Democratic county chairmen, organized labor, special interest groups and more. Even Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White — running for reelection this year himself — has given Giannoulias an endorsement.\nGiannoulias also leads other Democrat candidates by a wide margin in both name recognition and favorable opinion among voters statewide. A poll by the Chicago Tribune in December showed Giannoulias with 31 percent of voter support compared to 17 percent for Chicago Urban League president Cheryle Jackson and 9 percent for former Chicago inspector general David Hoffman. He did fall slightly behind Kirk in the poll, but those numbers compared the two candidates against candidates in their own party and may not represent the outcome of a race between the two frontrunners.\nHurdles ahead\nDespite the advantages he undoubtedly enjoys, Giannoulias makes an easy target for opponents — Democrat and Republican — who seek to knock him from his perch, and he continues to confront questions about his past decisions and associations.\nPerhaps the most convincing argument raised against Giannoulias is his handling of the state’s Bright Start college savings program. In January 2009, Giannoulias announced that the program’s Core Plus investment fund had lost $85 million in value the previous year. He initiated a lawsuit against fund manager OppenheimerFunds, Inc., and announced a settlement in December 2009 that would see Oppenheimer return $77 million to Illinois. At that same time, Giannoulias revealed that 2009 losses to the fund put the total lost at $150 million, meaning Illinois would receive 51 percent of its losses back for a net loss of $73 million.\nHoffman says Giannoulias knew about the problem for months before he stopped allowing further investments in the troubled fund, claiming Giannoulias misled the public about the total amount lost until the settlement was announced. “He purposely misled the public and Bright Start victims about the size of the loss and how much he would recover,” Hoffman said in a press release. At a December candidates’ forum at the Union League Club of Chicago, Hoffman also questioned whether Bright Start was even one of the nation’s best.\nE-mails from Giannoulias to Oppenheimer reveal Giannoulias did try to work with Oppenheimer to “turn the ship around” after learning of the problem. Greg Brown, a mutual fund analyst at investment research company Morningstar, Inc., says Oppenheimer is under fire in several other states for misleading investors about its risky investment leverage, pointing out that Giannoulias was the first state official to recognize a problem and attempt to fix it. “To Illinois and Alexi’s credit, they were the first to sound the alarm,” Brown says. “They met quickly with Oppenheimer and asked what on earth was going on. In my opinion, they reacted as quickly as they could.”\nGiannoulias points out that the fund in question was only one of many funds included in Bright Start, and that only 3 percent of the program’s estimated $2 billion value was invested in the troubled Core Plus fund.\n“Oppenheimer made some investments that were impermissible,” he says. “There was nothing structurally wrong with Bright Start. David Hoffman likes to say people lost 50 percent of their money, but that’s not true. At worst, if you had all your money in Core Plus, which is 3 percent of the people, you lost 38 percent. But with the settlement, you get half that money back, so you only lose maximum, with the market rebounding, about 15.5 percent. To make it seem like people lost 50 percent of their money is horribly inaccurate.”\nEven so, the fact remains that some Illinois families lost money on his watch, and his opponents aren’t likely to let him forget it. As Giannoulias releases documents from the Oppenheimer settlement, he will likely face more tough criticism.\n“It’s troubling,” Jackson said at the Union League forum in December. “It does speak to the people, the families, that need protection the most, that are the most vulnerable…that their money wasn’t better protected.”\nThere’s also the Bright Start hybrid vehicle fiasco, in which Giannoulias used fees paid by Oppenheimer to purchase a hybrid SUV that is used to promote the program. He has come under fire for purchasing the vehicle at the same time the Bright Start program was experiencing such heavy losses. Giannoulias defends the purchase, however, saying it was not paid for with taxpayer funds or with proceeds from the program, and it is not driven for personal use.\nAnother issue that has dogged Giannoulias relates to the family bank, where he served as a vice president in charge of loans from 2002 to 2006. Broadway Bank made loans to unsavory borrowers before and during Giannoulias’ time there, and his opponents and the media have questioned his involvement.\nOne such loan went to Michael “Jaws” Giorango, a convicted bookkeeper and pimp who borrowed money from Broadway Bank for a fleet of gambling boats in Florida. Though Broadway is not accused of any wrongdoing, Giannoulias has been questioned on the propriety of such loans, and some of his political detractors have whispered that the Giannoulias family’s ties with crime may go deeper than simple loans. Giannoulias himself plays down such assertions.\n“It’s politics,” he says. “I think people are sick and tired of guilt by association.”\nIn the same vein is the claim that Broadway Bank bankrolled Tony Rezko, a political fundraiser convicted in federal court of money laundering and fraud in June 2008. Rezko has ties with impeached governor Rod Blagojevich, and he is accused of writing nine bad checks totaling nearly $450,000 in Las Vegas from a checking account he held at Broadway. The bank did not cover the checks, Giannoulias points out, saying that is proof the bank has nothing to hide. Rezko also received loans from the bank, and he is now considered to be in default, though Giannoulias says he was considered credit-worthy when the loans were issued.\n“Tony Rezko has never supported me politically,” Giannoulias says. “Republicans like to make that claim, but there’s only one candidate that’s ever taken money from Rezko, and that’s Mark Kirk. I haven’t; he has.”\n(Records from the FEC show Kirk accepted $1,000 from Rezko in 2000.)\nPlanning for the future\nIf Giannoulias should survive the questioning, the primaries and the general election to find himself in the U.S. Senate, what can we expect from him?\nHis first priority would be job creation, he says. “This is about jobs, jobs, jobs. We all have neighbors, family members who have lost their jobs,” he says. “Young people are looking at the worst job market we’ve seen in a long time. People who were supposed to be retiring are trying to hang onto their jobs. It’s really scary out there.”\nHow does he expect to spur job growth? Cut taxes for small businesses, he says, tax overseas profits for corporations shipping jobs elsewhere, and create a payroll tax holiday for low-to-middle-income individuals. Giannoulias also says he wants to enact better oversight of non-bank mortgage lenders, erase federal budget deficits, end unfair trade agreements with China and a slew of other policy goals.\nFor now, those are simply ideas floating in the ether. What matters now for Giannoulias is the Feb. 2 primary, when Democrat voters will decide whether he has a shot at following in the footsteps of Obama or whether this has all been a pipedream.\nIn the meantime, Giannoulias is positioning himself as a public servant in this race, rather than as a politician.\n“I’m just doing it because I genuinely believe in helping people, and I think politics is a great avenue for true public service,” he says. “If we can get enough intelligent, capable, passionate, hard-working people in office who really care, we can make this world a better place. I don’t think that’s ever going to change, and the minute I stop feeling that way, I won’t run for office anymore. I’ll step aside.”\nContact Patrick Yeagle at pyeagle@illinoistimes.com.\nThis article appears in Jan 21-27, 2010.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Alexi Giannoulias’ last run for office — in 2010, for President Barack Obama’s former U.S. Senate seat — ended in stinging defeat that halted his political career.\nUntil Tuesday, at least, when Giannoulias, a Democrat, formalized his planned comeback, with a dominant win over Republican Dan Brady in the election for Illinois secretary of state.\nGiannoulias replaces the retiring Jesse White to run a state agency responsible for driver’s licenses and motor vehicle registrations — and known historically as a launching pad for even higher office.\nWith more than 47% of precincts reporting, Giannoulias had roughly 59% of the vote to around 39% for Brady, a veteran state legislator from Bloomington. Libertarian Jon Stewart had 2%.\nBrady’s spokeswoman says her candidate conceded Tuesday evening, before Giannoulias spoke to supporters, declaring victory.\n“Don’t ever let anybody count you out, don’t ever let anybody say you’re finished,” he told a cheering crowd, at times appearing to choke back tears. “Thank you for believing in me once again.”\nGiannoulias, a 46-year-old resident of the Near North Side, will be sworn in Jan. 9.\nIn what came across as a subtle critique of White’s nearly 24-year tenure, Giannoulias and Brady, 61, each spoke during the campaign of the need to “modernize” the agency.\nGiannoulias has said he wants to give drivers the ability to schedule appointments online to skip what are often frustratingly long lines at secretary of state facilities.\nHe floated the idea of creating digital — rather than just physical — driver’s licenses and state identification cards.\nBrady proposed cutting some fees, allowing electronic filing of some vehicle information and opening secretary of state outposts at community colleges.\nBeyond the ideas that emerged, Giannoulias faced tough criticism during his primary and general election — with much of it echoing what he’d faced in 2010 in his loss to Republican Mark Kirk in the U.S. Senate race.\nWhile serving as state treasurer from 2007 to 2011, Giannoulias’ office oversaw a college-savings program that lost tens of millions of dollars because of risky investment decisions by the fund manager.\nHis family’s Broadway Bank, where he’d worked, also made questionable loans to reputed organized crime figures — before collapsing in 2010 at a cost to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. of hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reported last year that, for this race, Giannoulias accepted campaign donations from four top officials of the bank. Among them were his two brothers, who ran the bank, which federal regulators shut down over losses that included more than $100 million in bad loans made to 17 failed commercial projects from New York to Los Angeles.\nGiannoulias’ campaign was well funded, raising more than $3 million from July through September alone — including $1 million from Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s political fund, records show.\nGiannoulias’ campaign also accepted campaign donations from the Service Employees International Union, including a political-action committee for Local 73, which represents secretary of state employees.\nGiannoulias apparently will continue to accept those types of donations, but has pledged as part of an ethics package not to accept contributions directly from employees or contractors of the agency.\nThe secretary of state post was long coveted by politicians because it came with patronage jobs — though these days there are just over 100 “at-will” employees out of a workforce of nearly 4,000. And the position has been considered a stepping stone to higher office, with Jim Edgar and George Ryan both serving as secretary of state before becoming governor, and Alan Dixon serving as secretary of state before becoming a U.S. senator from Illinois.\nAsked during a WTTW forum last month whether he’s running for this job so he can eventually springboard to another elected office, Giannoulias said: “No, I’m very excited about this opportunity, it’s the only office that I’d run for.”\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Republican Rep. Mark Kirk is attacking his Democratic opponent in the Illinois race for the U.S. Senate with two ads that go beyond what the facts support. The ads make unsupported claims about the role Giannoulias played at his family’s troubled bank and strain to tie him to BP, among other dubious statements.\nKirk released the new ads less than a day after he apologized for embellishing his own military record.\nBank Shot\nAccording to one of the ads, \"Risky,\" Giannoulias \"made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters.\" Photos of three men flash onscreen: Michael \"Jaws\" Giorango, John D’Arco Jr. and Boris \"Half Dollar\" Stratievsky.\nThere’s no question that Broadway Bank, which was founded by Giannoulias’ father and employed other members of the family including (for a time) Alexi himself, made loans to some troubling characters. But Alexi Giannoulias denies that he was personally responsible for making loans to the one person who actually could be described as a \"convicted mobster\" at the time he borrowed money. We asked the Kirk campaign for any evidence it had to the contrary, but staffers there provided only quotes from media reports indicating that Giannoulias had a senior position at the bank and that he has on occasion defended at least one of the loans.\nTo explain: An investigation by the Chicago Tribune showed that the Giannoulias family’s Broadway Bank loaned Michael \"Jaws\" Giorango and another Chicago crime figure, Demitri Stavropoulos, about $20 million while Giannoulias was a senior loan officer. Stavropoulos at the time was waiting to begin serving a prison term for running a multistate bookmaking operation, while Giorango was soon to be confined in connection with his conviction for promoting a nationwide prostitution ring. Criminals, without a doubt.\nBut Giannoulias told the Tribune in a statement that he \"was not a member of the loan committee that approved the financing for Giorango,\" who received the money through a company he had formed with Stavropoulos. Giannoulias’ older brother Demetris, the bank’s president and CEO at the time of the paper’s April 2010 story, said that Alexi’s role was mostly clerical: \"getting the appraisals ordered, getting the loan documents prepared, coordinating with attorneys, getting commitment letters prepared. All that kind of stuff.\" Demetris also said that Giorango had borrowed money from the bank on multiple previous occasions and the loans were \"performing,\" and said that the bank hadn’t been aware of Giorango’s convictions. Broadway later sued to foreclose on some of the properties financed by the loans.\nThe Tribune notes that \"Public records do not show which bank officials negotiated or approved any of the loans.\" Alexi Giannoulias has said little about the matter other than the statement we quote above. He has admitted to going to Miami to meet Giorango and inspect some of his ventures as part of performing due diligence on the loans, something he didn’t mention when reports of the Giorango loans first surfaced.\nAs for D’Arco, another of the men pictured in the ad, he was convicted in the 1990s of taking a bribe to introduce a bill when he was he was in the state legislature and of trying to fix a court case. He was tied to a Giorango company that received financing from Broadway in 2001. But he wasn’t an owner, and his name didn’t appear on any loan documents. Furthermore, Alexi Giannoulias has noted that he was in college at the time of that loan (he may actually have been in law school).\nThe third man shown, Boris Stratievsky, had \"not even a misdemeanor\" charge against him when he and his father received $20 million in loans from Broadway Bank, as Giannoulias has said. He was later indicted on money laundering and other charges.\nRegulators shut Broadway down on April 23, 2010, with MB Financial Bank, National Association stepping in and acquiring all of the deposits and assets, and sharing in the losses with the feds. The loss to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was estimated at $394.3 million.\nUpshot? Kirk’s ad goes too far in saying that Giannoulias \"made\" loans to \"convicted mobsters.\" There’s no proof that he \"made\" the loans to Giorango, the only one of the three men pictured who had been convicted at the time he borrowed money from Broadway. Another of the men didn’t get a loan from Broadway at all. And the third man wasn’t charged with a crime until after Giannoulias had signed off on loans to him. To be accurate, Kirk should have said only that his opponent worked at a family bank that made loans to criminals and their business ventures, and that he had a role in servicing some of the loans.\nThe College Cash Caper?\nThe ad’s next charge is that as state treasurer, Giannoulias \"made risky investments that cost families $73 million in lost college savings.\" And it’s true that Giannoulias, as treasurer, oversees the Illinois Bright Start 529 college savings plan, and that one of the funds in the plan lost about $150 million, mostly in 2008. But Kirk is taking it too far in blaming Giannoulias for the fiasco.\nHere’s what happened: the Bright Start 529 plan is managed by OppenheimerFunds, as are those of several other states. Oppenheimer put some of the money that individuals had invested in the 529s into its own Core Bond fund. Bond funds are normally prudent and relatively safe investments. But in this case, things went wrong. Here’s how Morningstar, the investment research firm, explained it:\nMorningstar, April 23 2009: Oppenheimer Core Bond….a fixture in [the] Oppenheimer-managed 529s, lost more than 35% in 2008 due to management’s bets on nonagency mortgages. In particular, management gained exposure to the battered commercial mortgage-backed securities market through derivatives that had a leveraging effect on the fund, amplifying losses…OppenheimerFunds is the poster child for how badly some 529 players went awry in 2008.\nCore Bond was just one of 21 funds that Bright Start owned, so most of the money in the 529 was not affected. Of the approximately $150 million of investors’ money that was lost in the Core fund, Giannoulias reached a settlement with Oppenheimer to recover $77 million. But is it the Democratic candidate’s fault that the fund went south? Even Kirk didn’t think so – at least, not last year. He blamed Oppenheimer. (At first he faulted \"a state bureaucrat that has a bad record,\" then later clarified to say he meant the Oppenheimer employee who ran the Core Plus fund, not a state worker.) Kirk didn’t mention Giannoulias at the time. Incidentally, Morningstar, which had named Illinois’ Bright Start one of the top 529 plans in the country a year earlier, said in 2009 that it \"still holds plenty of appeal\" as a college savings vehicle.\nWhere Do They Stand?\nKirk’s ad \"Stand,\" which began airing on June 30, attempts to capitalize on public anger over the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The ad characterizes Kirk as a BP opponent, while it puts Giannoulias in the oil company’s corner. But the ad strains the facts to make its case.\nStopped BP from Polluting?\nThe ad says \"Kirk won praise for helping stop BP when it tried to pollute Lake Michigan.\" That’s true enough, but not quite the whole story.\nThe ad cites a Chicago Sun-Times editorial that said Kirk \"fought hard to stop BP from dumping more waste into the lake.\" Kirk was one of several politicians to oppose a water permit BP was awarded in 2007 by the the Indiana Department of Environmental Management that would allow the company to increase the amount of ammonia (54 percent more) and suspended solids (35 percent more) that it dumped daily into Lake Michigan. The permit was requested as a part of the company’s $3.8 billion expansion of its refinery in Whiting, Ind. Both political and public pressure caused BP to reconsider its plan, and pledge that it wouldn’t move forward with plans to dump more pollution into the lake.\nBut the fact is, the Chicago Tribune reported that BP’s permit was not revoked, and the company’s pledge not to increase its pollution isn’t legally binding:\nChicago Tribune, Aug. 24, 2007: Neither BP nor Indiana officials would commit Thursday to adjusting the permit to legally lower the acceptable amount of ammonia and suspended solids released into the lake. Both the company and the state also said there will be no changes to another provision in the permit that exempts BP from tough limits on mercury pollution until 2012.\nScott Dean, a BP spokesman, said it would be up to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to alter the permit. But state officials said the company would first have to request the changes.\n\"The permit as issued is in effect,\" said Jane Jankowski, a spokeswoman for Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. \"If the company seeks a modification, it could be subject to change like any other permit.\"\nGiannoulias Aide: A Lobbyist for BP?\nThe ad claims that \"Alexi Giannoulias’ top aide was a longtime BP lobbyist.\" That’s a reference to Endy Zemenides, an attorney with the law firm Johnston Greene LLC, who also serves as an unpaid adviser to the Giannoulias campaign. But the lobbying he did for BP had nothing to do with oil drilling as the ad may lead viewers to believe.\nAccording to the Chicago Board of Ethics’ archive of registered lobbyists, Zemenides and his former law firm, Acosta, Kruse, Raines & Zemendies LLC, which later became just Acosta, Kruse & Zemenides, were registered lobbyists for the BP Bovis Global Alliance between 2003 and 2008. The Global Allliance was a partnership launched in 1996 between BP and Bovis Lend Lease, a project management and construction company, to build and maintain BP service stations in Europe. In later years, the BP-Bovis project expanded to other countries, including the United States.\nAccording to the Giannoulias campaign, Zemenides \"worked on zoning cases for BP-Bovis.\" That is backed up by Erika L. Kruse, a former partner at the firm with Zemenides, in an e-mail to FactCheck.org. Kruse also explained the Chicago’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance requires attorneys working on zoning matters to register as lobbyists:\nKruse, July 8: Mr. Zemenides provided legal services to BP/Bovis in connection with land use approvals required in the City of Chicago to convert then Amoco gas stations into BP stations. His representation was limited to these land use approvals and involved proceedings required under the City of Chicago’s Zoning Ordinance and covered by the Administrative Law Review Act. Because Mr. Zemenides appeared before the City of Chicago in this capacity, he was required to, and did, comply with the City of Chicago’s Governmental Ethics Ordinance that requires attorneys involved in zoning proceedings to register as \"lobbyists.\"\nHigher Energy Taxes, Too?\nThe ad also claims that \"Alexi says higher energy taxes are on the table.\" That’s likely a reference to Giannoulias’ support of a \"market-based system that puts a price on global warming pollution.\" Republicans have long labeled Democratic proposals to curb greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system, where companies would be able to buy and sell allowances to meet an emissions cap, as a \"national energy tax.\" But the ad fails to mention that before Kirk announced that he would run for Senate, and came out against pricing emissions, he was one of just eight Republican members of Congress to vote for the climate and energy bill sponsored by Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, that featured a cap-and-trade plan.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

For thousands of California local governments—K–12 schools, community colleges, cities, counties, and special districts—revenue from property tax bills represents the foundation of their budgets.\nAlthough property taxes and charges play a major role in California finance, many elements of this financing system are complex and not well understood. The purpose of this report is to serve as an introductory reference to this key funding source. The report begins by explaining the most common taxes and charges on the property tax bill and how these levies are calculated. It then describes how the funds collected from property tax bills—$55 billion in 2010–11—are distributed among local governments. Last, because California’s property taxation system has evoked controversy over the years, the report provides a framework for evaluating it. Specifically, we examine California property taxes relative to the criteria commonly used by economists for reviewing tax systems, including revenue growth, stability, simplicity, neutrality, and equity. The report is followed with an appendix providing further detail about the allocation of property tax revenue.\nWhat Is on the Property Tax Bill?\nA California property tax bill includes a variety of different taxes and charges. As shown on the sample property tax bill in Figure 1, these levies commonly include:\n- The 1 percent rate established by Proposition 13 (1978).\n- Additional tax rates to pay for local voter–approved debt.\n- Property assessments.\n- Mello–Roos taxes.\n- Parcel taxes.\nThe Constitution establishes a process for determining a property’s taxable value for purposes of calculating tax levies from the 1 percent rate and voter–approved debt. In our sample property tax bill, “Box A” identifies the taxable value of the property and “Box B” shows the property’s tax levies that are calculated based on this value. Levies based on value—such as the 1 percent rate and voter–approved debt rates—are known as “ad valorem” taxes.\nUnder the Constitution, other taxes and charges on the property tax bill (shown in “Box C”) may not be based on the property’s taxable value. Instead, they are based on other factors, such as the benefit the property owner receives from improvements.\nAs shown in “Box D,” the total amount due on most property tax bills is divided into two equal amounts. The first payment is due by December 10 and the second payment is due by April 10.\nHow Are Property Taxes and Charges Determined?\nAd valorem property taxes—the 1 percent rate and voter–approved debt rates—account for nearly 90 percent of the revenue collected from property tax bills in California. Given their importance, this section begins with an overview of ad valorem taxes and describes how county assessors determine property values. Later in the chapter, we discuss the taxes and charges that are determined based on factors other than property value.\nTaxes Based on Property Value\nThe 1 Percent Rate. The largest component of most property owners’ annual property tax bill is the 1 percent rate—often called the 1 percent general tax levy or countywide rate. The Constitution limits this rate to 1 percent of assessed value. As shown on our sample property tax bill, the owner of a property assessed at $350,000 owes $3,500 under the 1 percent rate. The 1 percent rate is a general tax, meaning that local governments may use its revenue for any public purpose.\nVoter–Approved Debt Rates. Most tax bills also include additional ad valorem property tax rates to pay for voter–approved debt. Revenue from these taxes is used primarily to repay general obligation bonds issued for local infrastructure projects, including the construction and rehabilitation of school facilities. (As described in the nearby box, some voter–approved rates are used to pay obligations approved by local voters before 1978.) Bond proceeds may not be used for general local government operating expenses, such as teacher salaries and administrative costs. Most local governments must obtain the approval of two–thirds of their local voters in order to issue general obligation bonds repaid with debt rates. General obligation bonds for school and community college facilities, however, may be approved by 55 percent of the school or community college district’s voters. Local voters do not approve a fixed tax rate for general obligation bond indebtedness. Instead, the rate adjusts annually so that it raises the amount of money needed to pay the bond costs.\nDebt Approved by Voters Prior to 1978\nThe California Constitution allows local governments to levy voter–approved debt rates—ad valorem rates above the 1 percent rate—for two purposes. The first purpose is to pay for indebtedness approved by voters prior to 1978, as allowed under Proposition 13 (1978). Proposition 42 (1986) authorized a second purpose by allowing local governments to levy additional ad valorem rates to pay the annual cost of general obligation bonds approved by voters for local infrastructure projects. Because most debt approved before 1978 has been paid off, most voter–approved debt rates today are used to repay general obligation bonds issued after 1986 as authorized under Proposition 42.\nSome local governments, however, continue to levy voter–approved debt rates for indebtedness approved by voters before 1978. While most bonds issued before the passage of Proposition 13 have been paid off, state courts have determined that other obligations approved by voters before 1978 also can be paid with an additional ad valorem rate. Two common pre–1978 obligations paid with voter–approved debt rates are local government employee retirement costs and payments to the State Water Project.\nVoter–Approved Retirement Benefits. Voters in some counties and cities approved ballot measures or city charters prior to 1978 that established retirement benefits for local government employees. The California Supreme Court ruled that such pension obligations represent voter–approved indebtedness that could be paid with an additional ad valorem rate. Local governments may levy the rate to cover pension benefits for any employee, including those hired after 1978, but not to cover any enhancements to pension benefits enacted after 1978. Local governments may adjust the rate annually to cover employee retirement costs, but state law limits the rate to the level charged for such purposes in 1982–83 or 1983–84, whichever is higher. A recent review shows that at least 20 cities and 1 county levy voter–approved debt rates to pay some portion of their annual pension costs. The rates differ by locality. For example, the City of Fresno’s voter–approved debt rate for employee retirement costs is 0.03 percent of assessed value in 2012–13, while the City of San Fernando’s rate is 0.28 percent.\nState Water Project Payments. Local water agencies can levy ad valorem rates above the 1 percent rate to pay their annual obligations for water deliveries from the State Water Project. State courts concluded that such costs were voter–approved debt because voters approved the construction, operation, and maintenance of the State Water Project in 1960. As a result, most water agencies that have contracts with the State Water Project levy a voter–approved debt rate.\nProperty tax bills often include more than one voter–approved debt rate. In our sample property tax bill, for example, the property owner is subject to four additional rates because local voters have approved bond funds for the city and water, school, and community college districts where the property is located. These rates tend to be a small percentage of assessed value. Statewide, the average property tax bill includes voter–approved debt rates that total about one–tenth of 1 percent of assessed value.\nCalculating Property Value for Ad Valorem Taxes\nOne of the first items listed on a property tax bill is the assessed value of the land and improvements. Assessed value is the taxable value of the property, which includes the land and any improvements made to the land, such as buildings, landscaping, or other developments. The assessed value of land and improvements is important because the 1 percent rate and voter–approved debt rates are levied as a percentage of this value, meaning that properties with higher assessed values owe higher property taxes.\nUnder California’s tax system, the assessed value of most property is based on its purchase price. Below, we describe the process county assessors use to determine the value of local “real property” (land, buildings, and other permanent structures). This is followed by an explanation of how assessors determine the value of “personal property” (property not affixed to land or structures, such as computers, boats, airplanes, and business equipment) and “state assessed property” (certain business properties that cross county boundaries).\nLocal Real Property Is Assessed at Acquisition Value and Adjusted Upward Each Year. The process that county assessors use to determine the value of real property was established by Proposition 13. Under this system, when real property is purchased, the county assessor assigns it an assessed value that is equal to its purchase price, or “acquisition value.” Each year thereafter, the property’s assessed value increases by 2 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. This process continues until the property is sold, at which point the county assessor again assigns it an assessed value equal to its most recent purchase price. In other words, a property’s assessed value resets to market value (what a willing buyer would pay for it) when it is sold. (As shown in Figure 2, voters have approved various constitutional amendments that exclude certain property transfers from triggering this reassessment.)\nFigure 2\nProperty Transfers That Do Not Trigger Reassessment\n|\nProposition\n|\nYear\n|\nDescription\n|\n|\n3\n|\n1982\n|\nAllows property owners whose property has been taken by eminent domain proceedings to transfer their existing assessed value to a new property of similar size and function.\n|\n|\n50\n|\n1986\n|\nAllows property owners whose property has been damaged or destroyed in a natural disaster to transfer their existing assessed value to a comparable replacement property within the same county.\n|\n|\n58\n|\n1986\n|\nExcludes property transfers between spouses or between parents and children from triggering reassessment.\n|\n|\n60\n|\n1986\n|\nAllows homeowners over the age of 55 to transfer their existing assessed value to a new home, of equal or lesser market value, within the same county.\n|\n|\n90\n|\n1988\n|\nExtends Proposition 60 by allowing homeowners to transfer their existing assessed value to a new home, of equal or lesser market value, in a different participating county.\n|\n|\n110\n|\n1990\n|\nAllows disabled homeowners to transfer their existing assessed value from an existing home to a newly purchased home of equal or lesser market value.\n|\n|\n171\n|\n1993\n|\nExtends Proposition 50 by allowing property owners affected by a natural disaster to transfer their existing assessed value to a comparable replacement property in a different participating county.\n|\n|\n193\n|\n1996\n|\nExcludes property transfers between grandparents and grandchildren (when the parents are deceased) from triggering reassessment.\n|\n|\n1\n|\n1998\n|\nAllows property owners whose property is made unusable by an environmental problem to transfer their existing assessed value to a comparable replacement property.\n|\nIn most years, under this assessment practice, a property’s market value is greater than its assessed value. This occurs because assessed values increase by a maximum of 2 percent per year, whereas market values tend to increase more rapidly. Therefore, as long as a property does not change ownership, its assessed value increases predictably from one year to the next and is unaffected by higher annual increases in market value. For example, Figure 3 shows how a hypothetical property purchased in 1995 for $185,000 would be assessed in 2012. Although the market value of the property increased to $300,000 by 2002, the assessed value was $200,000 because assessed value grew by only up to 2 percent each year. Upon being sold in 2002, the property’s assessed value reset to a market value of $300,000. Because of the large annual increase in home values after 2002, however, the market value was soon much greater than the assessed value for the new owner as well.\nProperty Improvements Are Assessed Separately. When property owners undertake property improvements, such as additions, remodeling, or building expansions, the additions or upgrades are assessed at market value in that year and increase by up to 2 percent each year thereafter. The unimproved portion of the property continues to be assessed based on its original acquisition value. For example, if a homeowner purchased a home in 2002 and then added a garage in 2010, the home and garage would be assessed separately. The original property would be assessed at its 2002 acquisition value adjusted upward each year while the garage would be assessed at its 2010 market value adjusted upward. The property’s assessed value would be the combined value of the two portions. (As shown in Figure 4, voters have excluded certain property improvements from increasing the assessed value of a property.)\nFigure 4\nProperty Improvements That Do Not Increase a Property’s Assessed Value\nConstitutional Amendments Approved After June 1978\n|\nProposition\n|\nYear\n|\nType of Improvement\n|\n|\n8\n|\n1978\n|\nReconstruction following natural disaster\n|\n|\n7\n|\n1980\n|\nSolar energy construction\n|\n|\n31\n|\n1984\n|\nFire–safety improvements\n|\n|\n110\n|\n1990\n|\nAccessibility construction for disabled homeowners\n|\n|\n177\n|\n1994\n|\nAccessibility construction for any property\n|\n|\n1\n|\n1998\n|\nReconstruction following environmental contamination\n|\n|\n13\n|\n2010\n|\nSeismic safety improvements\n|\nAssessed Value May Be Reduced When Market Values Fall Significantly. When real estate values decline or property damage occurs, a property’s market value may fall below its assessed value as set by Proposition 13. Absent any adjustment to this assessed value, the property would be taxed at a greater value than it is worth.\nIn these events, county assessors may automatically reduce the Proposition 13 assessed value of a property to its current market value. If they do not, however, a property owner may petition the assessor to have his or her assessed value reduced. These decline–in–value properties are often called “Prop 8 properties” after Proposition 8 (1978), which authorizes this assessment reduction to market value. Figure 5 illustrates the assessment of a hypothetical decline–in–value property over time. The market value of the property purchased in 1995 stays above its Proposition 13 assessed value through 2007. A significant decline, however, drops the property’s market value below its Proposition 13 assessed value. At this time, the property receives a decline–in–value assessment (equal to its market value) that is less than its Proposition 13 assessment. For three years, the property is assessed at market value, which may increase or decrease by any amount. By 2012, the property’s market value once again exceeds what its assessed value would have been absent Proposition 8 (acquisition price plus the 2 percent maximum annual increase). In subsequent years, the property’s assessed value is determined by its acquisition price adjusted upward each year.\nHomeowners Are Eligible for a Property Tax Exemption. Homeowners may claim a $7,000 exemption from the assessed value of their primary residence each year. As shown in “Box A” of the sample property tax bill in Figure 1, this exemption lowers the assessed value of the homeowner’s land and improvements by $7,000, reducing taxes under the 1 percent rate by $70 and reducing taxes from voter–approved debt rates by a statewide average of $8.\nTwo Types of Property Are Assessed at Their Market Value. Two categories of property are assessed at their current market value, rather than their acquisition value: personal property and state– assessed property. (We provide more information about these properties in the nearby box.)Combined, these types of properties accounted for 6 percent of statewide–assessed value in 2011–12. Most personal property and state–assessed property is taxed at the 1 percent rate plus any additional rates for voter–approved debt.\nProperties Assessed at Current Market Value\nPersonal Property. Personal property is property other than land, buildings, and other permanent structures, which are commonly referred to as “real property.” Most personal property is exempt from property taxation, including business inventories, materials used to manufacture products, household furniture and goods, personal items, and intangible property like gym memberships and life insurance policies. Some personal property, however, is subject to the property tax. These properties consist mainly of manufacturing equipment, business computers, planes, commercial boats, and office furniture. When determining the market value of personal property, county assessors take into account the loss in value due to the age and condition of personal property—a concept known as depreciation. Unlike property taxes on real property, which are due in two separate payments, taxes on personal property are due on July 3.\nState–Assessed Property. The State Board of Equalization is responsible for assessing certain real properties that cross county boundaries, such as pipelines, railroad tracks and cars, and canals. State–assessed properties are assessed at market value and, with the exception of railroad cars, taxed at the 1 percent rate plus any additional rates for voter–approved debt. (As part of a federal court settlement decades ago, railroad cars are taxed at a rate that is somewhat lower than 1 percent. The railcar tax rate varies each year and currently is about 0.8 percent.)\nDetermining Other Taxes and Charges\nAll other taxes and charges on the property tax bill are calculated based on factors other than the property’s assessed value. For example, some levies are based on the cost of a service provided to the property. Others are based on the size of a parcel, its square footage, number of rooms, or other characteristics. Below, we discuss three of the most common categories of non–ad valorem levies: assessments, parcel taxes, and Mello–Roos taxes. In addition to these three categories, some local governments collect certain fees for service on property tax bills, such as charges to clear weeds on properties where the weeds present a fire safety hazard. These fees are diverse and relatively minor, and therefore are not examined in this report.\nAssessments. Local governments levy assessments in order to fund improvements that benefit real property. For example, with the approval of affected property owners, a city or county may create a street lighting assessment district to fund the construction, operation, and maintenance of street lighting in an area. Under Proposition 218 (1996), improvements funded with assessments must provide a direct benefit to the property owner. An assessment typically cannot be levied for facilities or services that provide general public benefits, such as schools, libraries, and public safety, even though these programs may increase the value of property. Moreover, the amount each property owner pays must reflect the cost incurred by the local government to provide the improvement and the benefit the property receives from it. To impose a new assessment, a local government must secure the approval of a weighted majority of affected property owners, with each property owner’s vote weighted in proportion to the amount of the assessment he or she would pay.\nParcel Taxes. With the approval of two–thirds of voters, local governments may impose a tax on all parcels in their jurisdiction (or a subset of parcels in their jurisdiction). Local governments typically set parcel taxes at fixed amounts per parcel (or fixed amounts per room or per square foot of the parcel). Unlike assessments, parcel tax revenue may be used to fund a variety of local government services, even if the service does not benefit the property directly. For example, school districts may use parcel tax revenue to pay teacher salaries or administrative costs. The use of parcel tax revenue, however, is restricted to the public programs, services, or projects that voters approved when enacting the parcel tax.\nMello–Roos Taxes. Mello–Roos taxes are a flexible revenue source for local governments because they (1) may be used to fund infrastructure projects or certain services; (2) may be levied in proportion to the benefit a property receives, equally on all parcels, by square footage, or by other factors; and (3) are collected within a geographical area drawn by local officials.\nLocal governments often use Mello–Roos taxes to pay for the public services and facilities associated with residential and commercial development. This occurs because landowners may approve Mello–Roos taxes by a special two–thirds vote—each owner receiving one vote per acre owned—when fewer than 12 registered voters reside in the proposed district. In this way, a developer who owns a large tract of land could vote to designate it as a Mello–Roos district. After the land is developed and sold to residential and commercial property owners, the new owners pay the Mello–Roos tax that funds schools, libraries, police and fire stations, or other public facilities and services in the new community. Mello–Roos taxes are subject to two–thirds voter approval when there are 12 or more voters in the proposed district.\nWhat Properties Are Taxed?\nProperty taxes and charges are imposed on many types of properties. These properties include common types such as owner–occupied homes and commercial office space, as well as less common types like timeshares and boating docks. In the section below, we describe the state’s property tax base—the types of real properties that are subject to the 1 percent rate and the share of total assessed value that each property type represents.\nDue to data limitations, we do not summarize the tax bases of other taxes and charges. We note, however, that the property tax base for other taxes and charges is different from the tax base for the 1 percent rate. This is because the 1 percent rate applies uniformly to all taxable real property, whereas other taxes and charges are levied at various levels and on various types of property throughout the state (according to local voter or local government preferences). For example, if a suburban school district levies a parcel tax on each parcel in a residential area, the owners of single–family homes would pay a large share of the total parcel taxes. Accordingly, the school district’s parcel tax base would be more heavily residential than the statewide property tax base under the 1 percent rate (which applies to all taxable property).\nWhat Properties Are Subject to the 1 Percent Rate?\nAlthough most real property is taxable, the Constitution exempts certain types of real property from taxation. In general, these are government properties or properties that are used for non–commercial purposes, including hospitals, religious properties, charities, and nonprofit schools and colleges. California properties that are subject to the property tax, however, can be classified in three ways:\n- Owner–occupied residential—properties that receive the state’s homeowner’s exemption, which homeowners may claim on their primary residence.\n- Investment and vacation residential—residential properties other than those used as a primary residence, including multifamily apartments, rental condominiums, rental homes, vacant residential land, and vacation homes.\n- Commercial—retail properties, industrial plants, farms, and other income–producing properties.\nDistribution of the Tax Base for the 1 Percent Rate\nOwner–Occupied Residential. In 2010–11, there were 5.5 million owner–occupied homes in California with a total assessed value of $1.6 trillion. As shown in Figure 6, owner–occupied residential properties accounted for the largest share—39 percent—of the state’s tax base for the 1 percent rate.\nInvestment and Vacation Residential. Although the majority of residential properties are owner occupied, many others are investment or vacation properties such as multifamily apartments, rental condominiums, rental homes, vacant residential land, and vacation homes. (We classify vacant residential land and vacation homes as investment properties because they are an investment asset for the owner, even if he or she does not receive current income from them.) In 2010–11, there were 4.2 million investment and vacation residential properties. The assessed value of these properties was about $1.4 trillion, which represents 34 percent of the state’s total assessed value.\nCommercial. In 2010–11, there were approximately 1.3 million commercial properties in California. This amount includes about 600,000 retail, industrial, and office properties (such as stores, gas stations, manufacturing facilities, and office buildings). It also includes 500,000 agricultural properties and 200,000 other properties (gas, oil, and mineral properties and the private use of public land). While commercial properties represent a relatively small share of the state’s total properties, they tend to have higher assessed values than other properties. Therefore, as shown in Figure 6, these properties (which have a total assessed value of $1.2 trillion) account for 28 percent of the state’s property tax base.\nHas the Distribution of the Property Tax Base Changed Over Time?\nThere is little statewide information regarding the composition of California’s property tax base over time. Based on the available information, however, it appears that homeowners may be paying a larger percentage of total property taxes today than they did decades ago. We note, for example, that the assessed value of owner–occupied homes has increased from a low of 32 percent of statewide assessed valuation in 1986–87 to a high of 39 percent in 2005–06. (The share was 36 percent in 2011–12.) It also appears likely that owners of commercial property are paying a smaller percentage of property taxes than they did decades ago. For example, Los Angeles County reports that the share of total assessed value represented by commercial property in the county declined from 40 percent in 1985 to 30 percent in 2012. In addition, the assessed value of commercial property in Santa Clara County has declined (as a share of the county total) from 29 percent to 24 percent since 1999–00.\nWhat Factors May Have Contributed to Changes in the Property Tax Base?\nVarious economic changes that have taken place over time probably have contributed to changes to California’s property tax base. For example, investment in residential property has increased significantly since the mid–1970s. Newly built single–family homes have become larger and are more likely to have valuable amenities than homes built earlier. As a result, new homes are more expensive to build and assessed at higher amounts than older homes. Over the same period, commercial activity in California has shifted away from traditional manufacturing, which tends to rely heavily on real property. Newer businesses, on the other hand, are more likely to be technology and information services based. These businesses tend to own less real property than traditional manufacturing firms do. (Technology and information services firms, however, rely heavily on business personal property—for example, computing systems, design studios, and office equipment—that are taxed as personal property and not included in the distribution of the state’s real property tax base.)\nIt also is possible that Proposition 13’s acquisition value assessment system has played a role in the changes to California’s tax base. Specifically, under Proposition 13, properties that change ownership more frequently tend to be assessed more closely to market value than properties that turn over less frequently. (Because properties are assessed to market value when they change ownership, properties that have not changed ownership in many years tend to have larger gaps between their assessed values and market values.) It is possible that some categories of properties change ownership more frequently than others and this could influence the composition of the overall tax base. The limited available research suggests that investment and vacation residential properties change ownership more frequently than commercial or owner–occupied residential property, indicating that they may be assessed closer to market value than other types of property.\nHow Much Revenue Is Collected?\nIn 2010–11, California property tax bills totaled $55 billion. As shown in Figure 7, this amount included $43.2 billion under the 1 percent rate and $5.7 billion from voter–approved debt rates, making ad valorem property taxes one of California’s largest revenue sources.\nComparatively little is known about the remaining $6 billion of other taxes and charges on the property tax bill. From various reports summarizing local government finances, elections, and bond issuances, it appears that most of this $6 billion reflects property assessments, parcel taxes, and Mello–Roos taxes, though statewide data are not available on the exact amounts collected for each of these funding sources.\nHow Is the Revenue Distributed?\nCalifornia property owners pay their property tax bills to their county tax collector (sometimes called the county treasurer–tax collector). The funds are then transferred to the county auditor for distribution. The county auditor distributes the funds collected from the 1 percent rate differently than the funds collected from the other taxes and charges on the bill. Specifically, the 1 percent rate is a shared revenue source for multiple local governments.\nThis section describes the distribution of revenue raised under the 1 percent rate and summarizes the limited available information regarding the distribution of voter–approved debt rates and non–ad valorem property taxes and charges.\nRevenue From the 1 Percent Rate Is Shared by Many Local Governments\nThe 1 percent rate generates most of the revenue from the property tax bill—roughly $43 billion in 2010–11. On a typical property tax bill, however, the 1 percent rate is listed as the general tax levy or countywide rate with no indication as to which local governments receive the revenue or for what purpose the funds are used. In general, county auditors allocate revenue from the 1 percent rate to a variety of local governments within the county pursuant to a series of complex state statutes.\nMore Than 4,000 Local Governments Receive Revenue From the 1 Percent Rate. All property tax revenue remains within the county in which it is collected to be used exclusively by local governments. As shown in Figure 8, property tax revenue from the 1 percent rate is distributed to counties, cities, K–12 schools, community college districts, and special districts. Until recently, redevelopment agencies also received property tax revenue. As described in the nearby box, redevelopment agencies were dissolved in 2012, but a large amount of property tax revenue continues to be used to pay the former agencies’ debts and obligations.\nFigure 8\nHow Many Local Governments Receive Revenue From the 1 Percent Rate?\n|\nType of Local Government\n|\nNumber\n|\n|\nCounties\n|\n58\n|\n|\nCities\n|\n480\n|\n|\nSchools and Community Colleges\n|\n|\n|\nK–12 school districts\n|\n966\n|\n|\nCounty Offices of Education\n|\n56\n|\n|\nCommunity college districts\n|\n72\n|\n|\nSpecial Districts\n|\n|\n|\nFire protection\n|\n348\n|\n|\nCounty service area\n|\n316\n|\n|\nCemetery\n|\n241\n|\n|\nCommunity services\n|\n201\n|\n|\nMaintenance\n|\n136\n|\n|\nHighway lighting\n|\n117\n|\n|\nCounty water\n|\n100\n|\n|\nRecreation and park\n|\n85\n|\n|\nHospital\n|\n64\n|\n|\nSanitary\n|\n60\n|\n|\nIrrigation\n|\n46\n|\n|\nMosquito abatement\n|\n43\n|\n|\nPublic utility\n|\n43\n|\n|\nOthera\n|\n400\n|\n|\nRedevelopment Agenciesb\n|\n422\n|\n|\nTotal\n|\n4,254\n|\nFigure 9 shows the share of revenue received by each type of local government from the 1 percent rate and voter–approved debt rates. (As described later in the report, however, these shares vary significantly by locality.)\nRedevelopment and Successor Agencies\nMore than 60 years ago, the Legislature established a process whereby a city or county could declare an area to be blighted and in need of redevelopment. After this declaration, most property tax revenue growth from the redevelopment “project area” was distributed to the redevelopment agency, instead of the other local governments serving the project area. As discussed in our report, The 2012–13 Budget: Unwinding Redevelopment, redevelopment agencies were dissolved in February 2012. Prior to their dissolution, however, redevelopment agencies received over $5 billion in property tax revenue annually. These monies were used to pay off tens of billions of dollars of outstanding bonds, contracts, and loans.\nIn most cases, the city or county that created the redevelopment agency is managing its dissolution as its successor agency. The successor agency manages redevelopment projects currently underway, pays existing debts and obligations, and disposes of redevelopment assets and properties. The successor agency is funded from the property tax revenue that previously would have been distributed to the redevelopment agency. As a result, even though redevelopment agencies have been dissolved, some property tax revenue continues to be used to pay redevelopment’s debts and obligations. Over time, most redevelopment obligations will be retired and the property tax revenue currently distributed to successor agencies will be distributed to K–14 districts, counties, cities, and special districts.\nProperty Taxes Also Affect the State Budget. Although the state does not receive any property tax revenue directly, the state has a substantial fiscal interest in the distribution of property tax revenue from the 1 percent rate because of the state’s education finance system. Each K–12 district receives “revenue limit” funding—the largest source of funding for districts—from the combination of local property tax revenue under the 1 percent rate and state resources. Thus, if a K–12 district’s local property tax revenue is not sufficient to meet its revenue limit, the state provides additional funds. Community colleges have a similar financing system, in which each district receives apportionment funding from local property tax revenue, student fees, and state resources. In 2010–11, the state contributed $22.5 billion to K–12 revenue limits and community college apportionments, while the remainder ($14.5 billion) came from local property tax revenue (and student fees).\nState Laws Direct Allocation of Revenue From the 1 Percent Rate. The county auditor is responsible for allocating revenue generated from the 1 percent rate to local governments pursuant to state law. The allocation system is commonly referred to as “AB 8,” after the bill that first implemented the system—Chapter 282, Statutes of 1979 (AB 8, L. Greene). In general, AB 8 provides a share of the total property taxes collected within a community to each local government that provides services within that community. Each local government’s share is based on its proportionate countywide share of property taxes during the mid–1970s, a time when each local government determined its own property tax rate and property owners paid taxes based on the sum of these rates. (The average property tax rate totaled about 2.7 percent.) As a result, local governments that received a large share of property taxes in the 1970s typically receive a relatively large share of revenue from the 1 percent rate under AB 8. (More detail on the history of the state’s property tax allocation system—including AB 8—is provided in the appendix of this report.)\nRevenue Allocated by Tax Rate Area (TRA). The county auditor allocates the revenue to local governments by TRA. A TRA is a small geographical area within the county that contains properties that are all served by a unique combination of local governments—the county, a city, and the same set of special districts and school districts. A single county may have thousands of TRAs. While there is considerable variation in the steps county auditors use to allocate revenue within each TRA, typically the county auditor annually determines how much revenue was collected in each TRA and first allocates to each local government in the TRA the same amount of revenue it received in the prior year. Each local government then receives a share of any growth (or loss) in revenue that occurred within the TRA that year. Each TRA has a set of growth factors that specify the proportion of revenue growth that goes to each local government. These factors—developed by county auditors pursuant to AB 8—are largely based on the share of revenue each local government received from the TRA during the late 1970s.\nFigure 10 shows sample growth factors for TRAs in two California cities. As the figure indicates, 23 percent of any growth in revenue from the 1 percent rate in the sample TRA for Norwalk would be allocated to the county, 7 percent would go to the city, and the rest would be allocated to various educational entities and special districts. The percentage of property tax growth allocated to each type of local government can vary significantly by TRA. For example, Walnut Creek’s K–12 school district receives 33 percent of the growth in revenue within its TRA while Norwalk’s school district receives only 19 percent from its TRA. As noted above, this variation is based largely on historical factors specified in AB 8.\nFigure 10\nAllocation of Property Tax Growth in Sample Tax Rate Areas\n|\nNorwalk, Los Angeles Countya\n|\nPercent Share\n|\n|\nLos Angeles County\n|\n23%\n|\n|\nEducational Revenue Augmentation Fund\n|\n20\n|\n|\nNorwalk–La Mirada Unified School District\n|\n19\n|\n|\nLos Angeles County Fire Protection District\n|\n18\n|\n|\nCity of Norwalk\n|\n7\n|\n|\nNorwalk Parks and Recreation District\n|\n3\n|\n|\nLos Angeles County Library\n|\n2\n|\n|\nLa Mirada Parks and Recreation District\n|\n2\n|\n|\nCerritos Community College District\n|\n2\n|\n|\nLos Angeles County Flood Control District\n|\n1\n|\n|\nLos Angeles County Sanitation District\n|\n1\n|\n|\nGreater Los Angeles County Vector Control\n|\n—b\n|\n|\nWater Replenishment District of Southern California\n|\n—b\n|\n|\nLittle Lake Cemetery District\n|\n—b\n|\n|\nLos Angeles County Department of Education\n|\n—b\n|\n|\n|\n100%\n|\n|\nWalnut Creek, Contra Costa Countyc\n|\nPercent Share\n|\n|\nMount Diablo Unified School District\n|\n33%\n|\n|\nEducational Revenue Augmentation Fund\n|\n17\n|\n|\nContra Costa County\n|\n13\n|\n|\nContra Costa County Fire\n|\n13\n|\n|\nCity of Walnut Creek\n|\n9\n|\n|\nContra Costa Community College District\n|\n5\n|\n|\nEast Bay Regional Park District\n|\n3\n|\n|\nContra Costa County Library\n|\n2\n|\n|\nCentral Contra Costa Sanitary District\n|\n2\n|\n|\nContra Costa County Office of Education\n|\n1\n|\n|\nContra Costa County Flood Control\n|\n1\n|\n|\nBay Area Rapid Transit\n|\n1\n|\n|\nContra Costa Water District\n|\n1\n|\n|\nContra Costa County Water Agency\n|\n—b\n|\n|\nContra Costa County Resource Conservation District\n|\n—b\n|\n|\nContra Costa County Mosquito Abatement District\n|\n—b\n|\n|\nContra Costa County Service Area R–8\n|\n—b\n|\n|\nBay Area Air Management District\n|\n—b\n|\n|\n|\n100%\n|\nSome Revenue Is Allocated to a Countywide Account—ERAF. Most of the revenue from the 1 percent rate collected within a TRA is allocated to the city, county, K–14 districts, and special districts that serve the properties in that TRA. State law, however, directs the county auditor to shift a portion of this revenue to a countywide account that is distributed to other local governments that do not necessarily serve the taxed properties. The state originally established this account—the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF)—to provide additional funds to K–14 districts that do not receive sufficient property tax revenue to meet their minimum funding level. State laws later expanded the use of ERAF to include reimbursing cities and counties for the loss of other local revenue sources (the vehicle license fee and sales tax) due to changes in state policy. For example, Figure 10 shows that 20 percent of any revenue growth within Norwalk’s TRA is deposited into ERAF. It is possible that some or all of this revenue could be allocated to a city or K–14 district in a different part of Los Angeles County.\nMost Revenue From Voter–Approved Debt Distributed to Schools\nVoter–approved debt rates are levied on property owners so that local governments can pay the debt service on voter–approved general obligation bonds (and pre–1978 voter–approved obligations). The state’s K–12 school districts receive the majority of the revenue from voter–approved debt rates ($3.1 billion of $5.2 billion in 2009–10). The amount received by cities ($520 million), special districts ($470 million), and counties ($320 million) is significantly less. The amount of taxes collected to pay voter–approved debt varies considerably across the state. For example, the average amount paid by an Alameda County property owner for voter–approved debt rates is about $2 for each $1,000 of assessed value, while the average amount paid in some counties is less than 10 cents per $1,000 of assessed value.\nLimited Information About Distribution Of Other Property Taxes and Charges\nLess information is available about the statewide distribution of the revenue from parcel taxes, Mello–Roos taxes, and assessments.\nParcel Taxes. Recent election reports and financial data suggest that parcel taxes represent a significant and growing source of revenue for some local governments. Specifically, between 2001 and 2012, local voters approved about 180 parcel tax measures to fund cities, counties, and special districts, and about 135 measures to fund K–12 districts. The most recent K–12 financial data (2009–10) indicate that schools received about $350 million from this source. We were not able to locate information on the statewide amount of parcel tax revenue collected by cities, counties, and special districts.\nMello–Roos Taxes. Mello–Roos districts are required to report on their bond issuance, which provides some information about the types of local governments that receive Mello–Roos tax revenue. It is likely that local governments issuing a large amount of Mello–Roos bonds also are collecting a large amount of Mello–Roos tax revenue. Between 2004 and 2011, cities issued about 50 percent of the bonds issued by Mello–Roos districts in California, followed by K–12 districts at about 30 percent. During the same time period, the issuance of Mello–Roos bonds was concentrated in specific regions, as more than 60 percent of the bonds were issued by local governments in four counties—Riverside, Orange, San Diego, and Placer.\nAssessments. Most of the property improvements funded by assessments are provided by cities and special districts. In 2009–10, cities and special districts reported receiving $760 million and $650 million, respectively, in revenue from assessments. In contrast, counties reported $11 million in such revenues.\nWhy Do Local Government Property Tax Receipts Vary?\nThe share of revenue received by each type of local government from the 1 percent rate varies significantly by locality. County governments, for example, receive as little as 11 percent (Orange) and as much as 64 percent (Alpine) of the ad valorem property tax revenue collected within their county. As shown in Figure 11, revenue raised from the 1 percent rate also varies considerably by locality when measured by revenue per resident. Orange County receives about $175 per resident, while four counties receive more than $1,000 per resident. Although cities, on average, receive about $240 per resident in revenue from the 1 percent rate, some receive more than $500 per resident and many receive less than $150 per resident. School districts also receive widely different amounts of property taxes per enrolled student, with an average of just under $2,000. (As noted above, the state “tops off” school property tax revenue with state funds to bring most schools to similar revenue levels.) Finally, special districts also receive varying amounts of property tax revenue, though data limitations preclude us from summarizing this variation on a statewide basis.\nFigure 11\nProperty Tax Receipts From the 1 Percent Rate for Selected Local Governments\n2009–10\n|\nCities\n|\nProperty Taxes per Resident\n|\nCounties\n|\nProperty Taxes per Resident\n|\nSchoolsa\n|\nProperty Taxes per Student\n|\n|\nIndustry\n|\n$2,541\n|\nSan Franciscob\n|\n$1,411\n|\nMono\n|\n$10,683\n|\n|\nMalibu\n|\n559\n|\nSierra\n|\n1,126\n|\nSan Mateo\n|\n5,432\n|\n|\nMountain View\n|\n344\n|\nInyo\n|\n876\n|\nMarin\n|\n5,213\n|\n|\nLos Angeles\n|\n332\n|\nNapa\n|\n522\n|\nSan Francisco\n|\n4,020\n|\n|\nLong Beach\n|\n268\n|\nEl Dorado\n|\n464\n|\nOrange\n|\n3,315\n|\n|\nOakland\n|\n250\n|\nLos Angeles\n|\n359\n|\nSan Diego\n|\n2,760\n|\n|\nState Average\n|\n242\n|\nState Average\n|\n320\n|\nState Average\n|\n1,960\n|\n|\nSan Jose\n|\n200\n|\nAlameda\n|\n301\n|\nYolo\n|\n1,765\n|\n|\nFresno\n|\n183\n|\nSacramento\n|\n286\n|\nSacramento\n|\n1,344\n|\n|\nAnaheim\n|\n167\n|\nContra Costa\n|\n271\n|\nSan Joaquin\n|\n1,163\n|\n|\nSanta Clarita\n|\n140\n|\nSan Diego\n|\n261\n|\nLos Angeles\n|\n1,142\n|\n|\nChico\n|\n129\n|\nRiverside\n|\n200\n|\nFresno\n|\n810\n|\n|\nModesto\n|\n119\n|\nOrange\n|\n174\n|\nKings\n|\n379\n|\nThree factors account for most of this variation in local government property tax receipts. We discuss these factors below.\nVariation in Property Values\nCalifornia has a diverse array of communities with large variation in land and property values. Some communities are extensively developed and have many high–value homes and businesses, whereas others do not. Because property taxes are based on the assessed value of property, communities with greater levels of real estate development tend to receive more property tax revenue than communities with fewer developments. For example, high–density cities generally receive more property tax revenue than rural areas due to the greater level of development. Coastal and resort areas also typically receive more property taxes due to the high property values. Certain high–value properties—such as a power plant or oil refinery—also increase property tax revenue. Alternatively, localities with large amounts of land owned by the federal government, universities, or other organizations that are not required to pay property taxes may receive less revenue.\nPrior Use of Redevelopment\nPrior decisions by cities and counties to use redevelopment also influences the amount of property tax revenue local governments receive. Prior to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies in 2012, most of the growth in property taxes from redevelopment project areas went to the redevelopment agency, rather than other local governments. A large share of property tax revenue now goes to successor agencies to pay the former redevelopment agencies’ debts and obligations. The use of redevelopment varied extensively throughout the state. In those communities with many redevelopment project areas, the share of property tax revenue going to other local governments is less than it would be otherwise. In places with large redevelopment project areas—such as San Bernardino and Riverside counties—more than 20 percent of the county’s property tax revenue may go to pay the former redevelopment agencies’ debts and obligations.\nState Allocation Laws Reflecting 1970s Taxation Levels\nFinally, the amount of property taxes allocated to local governments depends on state property tax allocation laws, principally AB 8. As discussed earlier in this report (and in more detail in the appendix), the AB 8 system was designed, in part, to allocate property tax revenue in proportion to the share of property taxes received by a local government in the mid–1970s. Under this system, local governments that received a large share of property taxes in the 1970s typically continue to receive a relatively large share of property taxes today. Although there have been changes to the original property tax allocation system contained in AB 8, the allocation system continues to be substantially based on the variation in property tax receipts in effect in the 1970s.\nThis variation largely reflects service levels provided by local governments in the 1970s. Local governments providing many services generally collected more property taxes in the 1970s to pay for those services. As a result, those local governments received a larger share of property taxes under AB 8. For example, cities and counties that provided many government services, including fire protection, park and recreation programs, and water services, typically receive more property tax revenue than governments that relied on special districts to provide some or all of these services.\nAre There Concerns About How Property Taxes Are Distributed?\nWhile no system for sharing revenues among governmental entities is perfect, the state’s system for allocating property tax revenue from the 1 percent rate raises significant concerns about local control, responsiveness to modern needs, and transparency and accountability to taxpayers. We discuss these concerns separately below and then address the question: Could the state change the allocation system?\nLack of Local Control\nUnlike local communities in other states, California residents and local officials have virtually no control over the distribution of property tax revenue to local governments. Instead, all major decisions regarding property tax allocation are controlled by the state. Accordingly, if residents desire an enhanced level of a particular service, there is no local forum or mechanism to allow property taxes to be reallocated among local governments to finance this improvement. For example, Orange County currently receives a very low share of property taxes collected within its borders—about 11 percent. If Orange County residents and businesses wished to expand county services, they have no way to redirect the property taxes currently allocated to other local governments. Their only option would be to request the Legislature to enact a new law—approved by two–thirds of the members of both houses—requiring the change in the property tax distribution. In other words, local officials have no power to raise or lower their property tax share on an annual basis to reflect the changing needs of their communities. As a result, if residents wish to increase overall county services, they would need to finance this improvement by raising funds through a different mechanism such as an assessment or special tax.\nLimited Transparency and Accountability\nThe state’s current allocation system also makes it difficult for taxpayers to see which entities receive their tax dollars. Property tax bills note only that a bulk of the payment goes to the 1 percent general levy. Even if taxpayers do further research and locate the AB 8 local government sharing factors for their TRA, it is difficult to follow the actual allocation of revenue because the fund shifts related to ERAF and redevelopment complicate this system.\nIn addition to making it difficult for taxpayers to determine how their tax dollars are distributed, the AB 8 system reduces government accountability. The link between the level of government controlling the allocation of the tax (the state) and the government that spends the tax revenue (cities, counties, special districts, and K–14 districts) is severed. For example, if a taxpayer believes the level of services provided by an independent park district is inadequate, it is difficult to hold the district entirely accountable because the state is responsible for determining the share of property taxes allocated to the district.\nLimited Responsiveness to Modern Needs and Preferences\nAn effective tax allocation system ensures that local tax revenue is allocated in a way that reflects modern needs and preferences. In many ways, California’s property tax allocation system—which remains largely based on allocation preferences from the 1970s—does not meet this criterion. California’s population and the governance structure of many local communities have changed significantly since the AB 8 system was enacted. For example, certain areas with relatively sparse populations in the 1970s have experienced substantial growth and many local government responsibilities have changed. One water district in San Mateo County—Los Trancos Water District—illustrates the extent to which the state’s property tax allocation system continues to reflect service levels from the 1970s. Specifically, this water district sold its entire water distribution system to a private company in 2005, but continues to receive property tax revenue for a service it no longer provides.\nChanging the Allocation System Is Difficult\nOver the years, the Legislature, local governments, the business community, and the public have recognized the limitations inherent in the state’s property tax allocation system. Despite the large degree of consensus on the problems, major proposals to reform the allocation system have not been enacted due to their complexity and the difficult trade–offs involved. Because California has thousands of local governments—many with overlapping jurisdictions—reorienting the property tax allocation system would be extraordinarily complex. Updating the AB 8 property tax sharing methodology would require the Legislature to determine the needs and preferences of each California community and local government. This would be a difficult—if not impossible—task to undertake in a centralized manner. Alternatively, the state could allow the distribution of the property tax to be carried out locally, but there is no consensus about what process local governments would use to allocate property taxes among themselves. Whether done centrally or locally, any reallocation is difficult because providing additional property tax receipts to one local government would require redirecting it from another local government or amending the Constitution. In addition, any significant change to the allocation of property tax revenue would require approval by two–thirds of the Legislature due to provisions in the Constitution added by Proposition 1A (2004). (These issues are discussed further in the appendix.)\nWhat Are the Strengths and Limitations of California’s Property Tax System?\nFor many years, California’s overall property tax system—the types of taxes paid by property owners and the determination of property owner tax liabilities—has evoked controversy. Some people question whether the distribution of the tax burden between residential and commercial properties is appropriate and whether the amount of taxes someone pays should depend, in part, on how long he or she has owned the property. Other people praise the financial certainty that the tax system gives property owners. From one year to the next, property owners know that their tax liabilities under the 1 percent rate will increase only modestly. In this section, we do not attempt to resolve this long–standing debate. Instead, we review property taxes by looking at how they measure according to five common tax policy criteria—growth, stability, simplicity, neutrality, and equity. Using this framework, we highlight particular aspects of the state’s property tax system, both its strengths and limitations, for policymakers and other interested parties.\nEconomists use the five common tax policy criteria summarized in Figure 12 to objectively compare particular taxes. These criteria relate to how taxes affect people’s decisions, how they treat different taxpayers, and how the revenue raised from taxes performs over time. In practice, all taxes involve trade–offs. Sometimes the trade–offs are between two tax policy criteria. For example, revenue sources that grow quickly may be less stable from one year to the next than other revenue sources. Other times, the trade–offs are between tax policy criteria and other governmental policy objectives that may not be directly related to one of the five tax criteria. For example, one such trade–off might be that ensuring that a property owner’s taxes do not increase dramatically from one year to the next (a reasonable governmental policy objective) can result in a tax system in which the owners of similar properties are taxed much differently (contrary to the equity criteria of tax policy).\nFigure 12\nCommon Economic Criteria for Evaluating Tax Systems\n- Growth—Does revenue raised by the tax grow along with the economy or the program responsibilities it is expected to fund?\n|\n- Stability—Is the revenue raised by the tax relatively stable over time?\n|\n- Simplicity—Is the tax simple and inexpensive for taxpayers to pay and for government to collect?\n|\n- Neutrality—Does the tax have little or no impact on people’s decisions about how much to buy, sell, and invest?\n|\n- Equity—Do taxpayers with similar incomes pay similar amounts and do tax liabilities rise with income?\n|\nWhat Factors Affect Property Tax Growth Each Year?\nMost of the annual change in property tax revenues is the result of large changes in assessed value that affect a small number of properties, including:\n- Recently Sold Properties. When a property sells, its assessed value resets to the purchase price. This represents additional value that is added to the tax base because the sale price of the property is often much higher than its previous assessed value.\n- Newly Built Property and Property Improvements. New value is added to the county’s tax base when new construction takes place or improvements are made—mainly additions, remodels, and facility expansions—because structures are assessed at market value the year that they are built.\n- Proposition 8 (1978) Decline–in–Value Properties. These properties contribute significantly to growth or decline in a county’s tax base because their assessed values may increase or decrease dramatically in any year. A particularly large impact on assessed valuation tends to occur in years when a large number of these properties transfer from Proposition 13 assessment to reduced assessment.\nAs shown by the dark bars in the figure below, recently sold, newly built, and decline–in–value properties typically account for more than two–thirds of total changes in countywide assessed value in Santa Clara County. Other properties, although they represent most of the properties in the county’s tax base, contribute less because the growth of these properties’ assessed values is limited to 2 percent per year.\nWhat Factors Affect Property Tax Stability?\nAcquisition Value Assessment System Contributes to Revenue Stability.The main reason California’s property tax revenue is stable is that the assessed value of most properties increases each year by a maximum of 2 percent. In any given year, only a small fraction of properties are sold and reset to market value. This means that real estate conditions affect a relatively small portion of the tax base each year, insulating property tax revenue from year–to–year real estate fluctuations.\nProposition 8 (1978) Decline–in–Value Properties Reduce Revenue Stability. As noted earlier in the report, county assessors may reduce a property’s assessed value in the event that its market value falls below its assessed value. Each year thereafter, the property is assessed at market value until it rises above what its assessed value would have been had it remained at its acquisition value adjusted upward each year at a maximum of 2 percent. During 2010–11, more than one in four properties in California was temporarily assessed to market value. Because these properties are assessed each year at market value, they link the property tax base more closely to the local real estate market than other properties, thereby reducing the property tax’s stability somewhat.\nRevenue Growth\nFrom government’s perspective, revenue sources that grow along with the economy are preferable because they can provide resources sufficient to maintain current services. This can help governments avoid increasing existing taxes or taxing additional activities in order to meet current service demands.\nThe Property Tax Has Grown Faster Than the Economy. Personal income in California—an approximate measure of the size of the state’s economy—has grown at an average annual rate of 6.3 percent since 1979. Over the same period, revenue from the 1 percent property tax rate has grown at an average annual rate of 7.3 percent. As we describe in the nearby box, much of the growth in property tax revenue depends on new construction and property sales.\nThe Growth of Parcel and Mello–Roos Tax Revenues Depends on the Structure of the Tax. The terms of parcel taxes and Mello–Roos taxes vary by locality. Some local governments have taxes with escalation clauses or other provisions that modify the amount of the tax as local government costs change. Other parcel taxes and Mello–Roos taxes are set at fixed amounts per parcel. Depending on their structure, these taxes may or may not provide local governments with a growing source of revenue.\nRevenue Stability\nRevenue sources that remain relatively stable from one year to the next help governments manage economic downturns, which tend to reduce revenue and at the same time increase demand for certain public services. Stable revenue sources also may help governments plan more effectively for future needs, including long–term investments in transportation, education, and public safety.\nThe Property Tax Is a Stable Revenue Source. Despite being linked to the volatile real estate market, the property tax is California’s most stable major revenue source. Since 1979, as shown in Figure 13, personal income tax revenue has been three times more volatile, on average, than property tax revenue from the 1 percent rate. During the same period, statewide property tax revenue has declined in only three years, 1994–95, 2009–10, and 2010–11.\nThe Property Tax Was More Stable Than Other Revenue Sources During the Recent Recession. As shown in Figure 14, revenue from the 1 percent property tax rate fared comparatively well during the most recent recession. (In the nearby box, we discuss why the property tax is stable.) Changes in property tax revenue tend to lag economic trends by one or more years because of the state’s acquisition value assessment system and the lengthy period between when most properties are assessed (January) and when property tax payments are due (December of that year and April of the next).\nParcel Taxes and Mello–Roos Taxes Also Are Stable. Because most parcel and Mello–Roos taxes are set at fixed amounts per parcel, there is minimal year–to–year fluctuation in the revenues that they raise.\nAssessed Valuation in Some Counties, However, Has Declined Significantly. Though statewide property tax revenue has remained comparatively stable throughout the recent recession, some areas of the state have experienced considerable declines in their property tax base. These counties tend to have a large proportion of their properties under Proposition 8 decline–in–value assessments and have high foreclosure rates. For example, Riverside County had the second highest number of foreclosures (17,000) among counties and more than 400,000 decline–in–value properties in 2011. Partly as a result of these trends, total assessed value in Riverside County declined by 15 percent between 2008 and 2011.\nSimplicity\nA well–designed tax system should be simple for taxpayers to understand and easy and inexpensive for governments to administer. Complex tax systems can be expensive for governments to administer effectively and may be confusing, time–consuming, and costly for taxpayers.\nMost of the costs associated with administering the state’s property tax system (ad valorem property taxes, parcel taxes, and Mello–Roos taxes) reflect the activities by county assessors, tax collectors, and auditors. While comprehensive data on these costs are not available, total property tax administration costs likely are between 1.5 percent and 2 percent of collections, a somewhat higher level than that of state tax agencies that perform similar functions. A significant component of the property tax’s administrative cost is from counties’ responsibility to allocate property taxes to local governments pursuant to increasingly complex state laws. County costs related solely to determining property values, the other main component of administration, were slightly less than 1 percent of total revenues collected in 2010–11—a percentage similar to that of state tax agencies.\nFrom the taxpayers’ perspective, the property tax is generally a simple tax with which to comply. Tax payments are due in equal installments twice per year. And, in most years, the assessed value of real property grows automatically by a maximum of 2 percent. Reassessments based on market value (which taxpayers are more likely to appeal) occur infrequently for most property owners.\nThe property tax assessed on personal property is typically more administratively cumbersome for owners and assessors. This is because personal property is assessed annually at market value using complex depreciation schedules. These assessments, therefore, are more likely to be appealed, a process that can take more than a year to resolve.\nNeutrality\nNearly all taxes alter taxpayer behavior to some degree. Economists agree, however, that in most cases the ideal tax system is one that alters decisions—about what goods to buy, what products to make, and where to work or live—as little as possible. Economists prefer these “economically neutral” taxes because they assume that people and businesses are in the best position to make consumption, savings, and investment decisions that meet their economic and personal needs. Tax policies that influence what people buy and what businesses produce tend to distance people and businesses from their preferred choices, leaving them less well off than they would be if the tax system were economically neutral. Policymakers design some taxes, on the other hand, to influence taxpayer behavior in a way that promotes or discourages particular activities. In general, these should be well targeted and have strong justifications so that they achieve their policy goals with as little interference as possible in other personal decision making. Below, we describe how ad valorem property taxes may influence taxpayer behavior and then discuss the possible effects of parcel and Mello–Roos taxes.\nSome Homeowners and Businesses May Move Less Frequently. California’s ad valorem property taxes may affect an individual’s decision to move because longer ownership results in a lower effective property tax rate. (An effective property tax rate differs from the 1 percent basic rate in that it is the amount of property taxes paid divided by the current market value of the property.) As shown in Figure 15, effective tax rates can vary considerably. New Owner A, for example, has an effective tax rate of 1 percent because the assessed value of his or her property is the same as its market value. Owners B and C, who have owned their properties longer than Owner A, have assessed values below their market values because their market values increased by more than 2 percent each year (and therefore faster than assessed values). As a result, most owners who have owned a property for many years pay an effective tax rate well below 1 percent. For those choosing to move, however, their effective tax rate is reset to 1 percent, producing a moving penalty that may influence some property owners’ relocation decisions. For example, established firms that benefit from their comparatively low effective property tax rates could be dissuaded from relocating—decisions that, absent the moving penalty, could benefit the companies financially. (As we discuss below, differing effective tax rates also affect the equity of the property tax.)\nFigure 15\nHypothetical Effective Property Tax Rates for Three Property Owners\n|\n|\nYear Purchased\n|\nMarket Value\n|\nAssessed Value\n|\nProperty Tax Rate\n|\nProperty Tax Paid\n|\nEffective Tax Rate\n|\n|\nOwner A\n|\n2012\n|\n$300,000\n|\n$300,000\n|\n1%\n|\n$3,000\n|\n1.0%\n|\n|\nOwner B\n|\n2002\n|\n300,000\n|\n180,000\n|\n1\n|\n1,800\n|\n0.6\n|\n|\nOwner C\n|\n1986\n|\n300,000\n|\n110,000\n|\n1\n|\n1,100\n|\n0.4\n|\nHomeowners and Businesses May Invest Less in Property Improvements. When a property undergoes improvements, the newly constructed portion of the property is assessed at its full market value. The existing property, on the other hand, is typically assessed below its current market value, meaning that improvements are taxed at a higher effective rate than existing property. Because improvements are subject to higher effective tax rates, the return on investment that businesses receive from new improvements is lower and the taxes that homeowners pay on them are higher than they would be if all property—new and existing—were taxed uniformly. This may lead some businesses and homeowners to invest less than they otherwise would in new property improvements.\nHomeowners May Change Behavior in Response to Assessment Exclusions. Voters have approved ballot propositions that exclude some types of property transfers from triggering reassessment to market value. (These exclusions are summarized earlier in this report in Figure 2.) For example, residential property transfers between certain family members do not trigger reassessment. These exclusions could alter decisions homeowners make about their property. For example, a homeowner might transfer property to his or her child (thereby passing on his or her low effective property tax rate) when, absent the exclusion, the owner might have sold the property to a nonrelative. In turn, that child could find it more economical to rent the property (and benefit from the low effective property tax rate) than to sell (and forego the benefit of his or her low effective rate).\nEquity\nEquity relates to how taxes affect taxpayers with different levels of income or wealth. Economists use two different standards of equity—vertical and horizontal—to evaluate taxes. Vertical equity occurs when wealthier taxpayers pay a greater amount in taxes than less wealthy taxpayers. Horizontal equity, on the other hand, occurs when similar taxpayers—those with similar incomes or wealth—pay the same amount in taxes. Under an equitable property tax system (1) owners of highly valuable property pay more in taxes than owners of less valuable property and (2) the owners of two similar properties pay a similar amount in property taxes. Put differently, an equitable system would tax property owners at the same effective rate. As we discussed in the previous section, however, property owners often are subject to different effective tax rates. Therefore, California’s ad valorem property taxes, parcel taxes, and Mello–Roos taxes often do not meet these standards of equity.\nEquity Reduced by Acquisition Value Assessment and 2 Percent Assessed Value Cap. California’s property tax system does not consistently meet the standards of horizontal or vertical equity. As discussed earlier in this report, two owners with identical properties may pay different amounts of property taxes if one owner bought the property a decade before the other. In a tax system with horizontal equity, both owners would pay similar amounts. In relation to vertical equity, the tax system’s reliance on acquisition value and the 2 percent cap on assessed valuation growth can result in owners of valuable property paying less than owners of (recently acquired) less valuable property. In a tax system with vertical equity, owners of valuable property would pay more in taxes because owners of valuable property generally are wealthier than owners of less valuable property.\nHomeowners Who Are Mobile Pay Higher Effective Tax Rates. Homeowners who move often—military families, younger homeowners, or those with jobs that require them to relocate frequently—tend to have higher effective ad valorem tax rates than homeowners who move less frequently because newly purchased properties are assessed at market value. Relocation decisions may result from circumstances that households may not have foreseen, such as employment changes, divorce, or other changes in family composition. Under horizontal equity, in contrast, taxpayers pay similar taxes unless their household income, wealth, or consumption patterns differ.\nFixed–Rate Taxes Do Not Meet Vertical Equity Standard. Parcel taxes and Mello–Roos taxes typically meet the criteria of horizontal equity but not vertical equity because property owners typically are charged the same amounts—regardless of their wealth or their properties’ value.\nSummary\nOur comparison of California’s property tax system with common tax policy criteria found mixed results. The ad valorem taxes generally meet the goals of administrative simplicity and providing governments with a growing source of stable revenue, but often do not meet the goals of neutrality and equity. Specifically, California’s ad valorem tax system (1) may influence decisions property owners make about relocations and expansions and (2) treat similar taxpayers differently and wealthier taxpayers the same as less wealthy taxpayers.\nCalifornia’s other property taxes (parcel taxes and Mello–Roos taxes) generally perform well relative to the goals of stability, administrative simplicity, and horizontal equity, but may perform less well in regard to the other objectives.\nAppendix 1: The History of California’s Property Tax Allocation System\nCalifornia’s system for allocating property tax revenue from the 1 percent rate among local governments is complex and has changed over time. The most significant change was voter approval of Proposition 13 in 1978, which shifted the control over the allocation of property taxes from local communities to the state. Since that time the state has made several major changes that affect the amount of property tax revenue from the 1 percent rate distributed to counties, cities, K–14 districts, and special districts. Some of these changes have benefited the state fiscally (by indirectly reducing state costs for education). Others have benefited local governments or taxpayers. This appendix describes the evolution of the state’s property tax allocation system. The key events are highlighted in Figure A–1, and described in more detail below.\nFigure A–1\nHistory of California’s Property Tax Allocation\n|\n1972   \n|\nSB 90—Establishes school “revenue limit” funding system, giving the state a significant fiscal interest in the allocation of local property tax revenue.\n|\n|\n1978\n|\nProposition 13—Voters cap the basic property tax rate at 1 percent and give the state new responsibilities for allocating property tax revenue.\n|\n|\n|\nSB 154—State’s first law allocating property tax revenue.

Over time, their share of the property tax will revert to other local governments.\n|\nTax Allocation Prior to Proposition 13\nTax Allocation Determined Locally Until 1978. Prior to voter approval of Proposition 13 in 1978, each local government authorized to levy a property tax set its own rate (within certain statutory restrictions). Each local government annually determined the amount of revenue necessary to finance the desired level of services and set its property tax rate to collect that amount. A property owner’s property tax bill reflected the sum of the individual rates set by each taxing entity. Under this system, schools and community colleges received over 50 percent of statewide property tax revenue, counties about 30 percent, and cities about 10 percent. (At the local level, however, the share of property tax revenue supporting each type of local government varied. Some communities, for example, provided a greater percentage of total property tax revenue to schools and others provided more to their county or city.)\nProperty Tax Allocation Linked to State Budget in 1972. Although local governments had control over the property tax during this period, property tax revenue had an effect on the state’s budget beginning in 1972. Chapter 1406, Statutes of 1972 (SB 90, Dills), started an education finance system in which the state guarantees each school district an overall level of funding. For K–12 districts, each district receives an overall level of funding—a “revenue limit”—from local property taxes and state resources combined. Community college districts receive apportionment funding from local property taxes, student fees, and state resources. Thus, if a district’s local property tax revenue (and student fee revenue in the case of community colleges) is not sufficient, the state provides additional funds. If a district’s nonstate resources alone exceed the district’s revenue limit or apportionment funding level, the district does not receive state aid and can keep the excess local property tax revenue for educational programs and services at their discretion. These districts are commonly referred to as “basic aid” districts because historically they have received only the minimum amount of state aid required by the California Constitution (known as basic aid). This system of school finance gives the state a significant fiscal interest in the distribution of local property tax revenue.\nProposition 13 and the State’s Response\nProposition 13 fundamentally changed local government finance and assigned the state responsibility for property tax allocation. Property tax receipts fell by more than 60 percent because Proposition 13 lowered the statewide property tax rate to a constitutional maximum of 1 percent. Additionally, the measure required the state, rather than local communities, to determine the allocation of property tax revenue among the local governments within a county. In response to Proposition 13, the Legislature enacted two major bills: Chapter 292, Statutes of 1978 (SB 154, Petris) and then Chapter 282, Statutes of 1979 (AB 8, L. Greene). In general, these bills established methods for allocating the new lower amount of property tax revenue and shifted certain county and school district costs to the state.\nFirst State Allocation System—SB 154\nShortly after the passage of Proposition 13, the Legislature approved SB 154 in an effort to avoid major local government service reductions and significant fiscal distress from the decrease in property tax revenue. Senate Bill 154 was the state’s first attempt to allocate property taxes among counties, cities, special districts, and K–14 districts. Under SB 154, a local government’s share of the 1 percent property tax rate in 1978–79 was based on the share of countywide property tax revenue going to that local government before Proposition 13. For example, if a city received 10 percent of the property taxes collected by all local jurisdictions in the county prior to the passage of Proposition 13, the city would receive 10 percent of the property taxes collected in the county at the 1 percent rate. This was a significant change from the allocation of property taxes prior to Proposition 13, when a local government received property tax revenue only from the properties located within its jurisdiction. In addition, to partially offset the revenue loss resulting from the reduction in the property tax rate, SB 154 used state funds to relieve counties of a portion of their obligation to pay for certain health and welfare programs and to provide block grants to counties, cities, and special districts.\nThe Current Property Tax Allocation System—AB 8\nA year after enacting SB 154, the Legislature adopted AB 8, a long–term policy to allocate property taxes and provide fiscal relief to local governments. The legislation (1) directed county auditors to allocate 1979–80 property tax revenue in a manner similar to SB 154 but with some modifications and (2) established a method for allocating property tax growth in future years.\nNew Base Property Tax Allocation. Assembly Bill 8 established a new base property tax allocation for 1979–80. The new base allocations in AB 8 resembled those in SB 154—a local government’s share was based on the share of the countywide property tax going to that local government before Proposition 13—with some modification. Specifically, rather than continue the state block grants included in SB 154, AB 8 increased the base share of property taxes allocated to most counties, cities, and special districts by reducing the base share going to K–14 districts. (Under the state’s school finance system, K–14 district losses were in turn made up with increased state funds for education.) For cities and special districts, the increase in the base property tax allocation was derived from the block grant amount provided in SB 154. Cities received increased property taxes equivalent to about 83 percent of their SB 154 block grant amount and special districts 95 percent of their block grant amount. Counties received a combination of increased property taxes, reduced expenditure obligations for health and social services programs, and a state block grant for indigent health programs. The reduced county expenditure obligations included complete state assumption of the costs for Medi–Cal and the State Supplementary Payment Program, as well as an increased state share of costs for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (the predecessor to California Work Opportunities and Responsibility to Kids). (These changes resulted in an increased share of property tax revenue for most counties. As discussed in the nearby box, six counties ended up as so–called negative bailout counties.) In summary, AB 8 shifted property tax revenue away from K–14 districts in order to provide cities, special districts, and most counties with a greater amount of property tax revenue than they received the previous year under SB 154. As shown in Figure A–2, this greatly reduced K–14 districts’ share of the statewide property tax.\nWhat Are “Negative Bailout Counties?”\nAssembly Bill 8 did not provide additional property tax revenue to six counties (Alpine, Lassen, Mariposa, Plumas, Stanislaus, and Trinity). Under the provisions of AB 8, the increased share of the base property tax allocation to counties was calculated as the value of the SB 154 block grant plus a small adjustment for the cost of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program less the amount of the indigent health block grant. In these six counties, the value of the indigent health block grant was so great that it exceeded the value of the adjusted SB 154 block grant. In order for these counties to be treated in the same way as all other counties, the amount of property taxes allocated to these counties was reduced. Because these counties received a smaller percentage of total property taxes collected after implementation of AB 8 relative to their pre–Proposition 13 shares, these counties are termed negative bailout counties.\nNew Method for Allocating Property Tax Growth. Assembly Bill 8 also established a new process for allocating growth (or decline) in property tax revenue in future years. In contrast to the property tax allocation process in 1978–79 and 1979–80 (that distributed revenue on a countywide basis without regard to where the property was located), the legislation specified that future growth in property tax revenue would be allocated only to those local governments serving the property where the revenue increase took place. Accordingly, beginning in 1980–81, AB 8 required that each local government receives the same amount of property tax it received in the prior year plus its share of any growth or decline in property tax revenue that occurred in its jurisdiction.\nTo ensure that each local government receives the property tax growth from the properties it serves, each county is divided into tax rate areas (TRAs). Each local government represented in a TRA receives a share of the property tax growth that occurs within that TRA. As required by AB 8, county auditors developed a methodology to determine the percentage of property tax growth—known as TRA factors—to allocate to each local government in each TRA. These TRA factors were based largely on the 1979–80 base allocation established by AB 8 (including the shift of property tax revenue from K–14 districts to other local governments). In most counties, these TRA factors remain constant. Thus, if a city received 25 percent of the property tax revenue growth generated in a TRA in 1980–81 (the first year TRA factors were used to distribute property tax revenue growth), it continued to receive 25 percent of the growth in property taxes in future years. As a result, the distribution of property tax revenue among local governments continued to closely resemble the 1979–80 distribution until the first major changes to the AB 8 system occurred in the 1990s.\nIn summary, the AB 8 property tax allocation system provides each local government with the same amount of property tax revenue it received in the prior year (the base), plus its share of any growth or decline in property tax revenue that occurred in its jurisdiction in the current year.\nChanges to the AB 8 System\nThe state property tax allocation system set up in AB 8 continues to be the basis for property tax allocation among local governments today. Since 1979, however, there have been some significant changes to the original property tax allocation system contained in AB 8. In most cases, the changes reflect the complex fiscal relationship between the state and local governments. Because of the state’s role in allocating property tax revenue after Proposition 13 and in funding K–14 districts and other local programs, decisions regarding the state budget and other policy issues have led the Legislature and Governor to occasionally change how property tax revenue is distributed. We highlight the major changes in property tax allocation below. It is important to note, however, that these changes in property tax allocation do not explain the entire scope of the state–local fiscal relationship—a relationship that also has involved the realignment of many government programs and changes in other revenue sources such as the sales tax and the vehicle license fee (VLF). Some of these decisions have benefited the state fiscally, and others have benefited local governments or taxpayers.\nNo and Low Property Tax Cities\nOne change in property tax allocation relates to so–called “no and low property tax cities.” Cities that did not levy a property tax, levied only a very low property tax, or were not incorporated as cities prior to the passage of Proposition 13 typically received few property taxes under AB 8. During the 1980s the Legislature directed county auditors to modestly increase the amount of property taxes going to some of these cities by shifting a share of county property tax revenue to them.\nProperty Taxes Shifted to Schools\nOngoing Property Tax Shifts Started in 1990s. In 1992–93 and 1993–94, in response to serious budgetary shortfalls, the Legislature and Governor permanently redirected almost one–fifth of statewide property tax revenue—over $3 billion in 1993–94—from cities, counties, and special districts to K–14 districts. (The legislation also temporarily required redevelopment agencies to make payments to K–14 districts.) Under the changes in property tax allocation laws, the redirected property tax revenue is deposited into a countywide fund for schools, the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF). The property tax revenue from ERAF is distributed to non–basic aid schools and community colleges, reducing the state’s funding obligation for K–14 school districts.\nThe amount transferred into ERAF from each city, county, and special district was based on many factors, including the magnitude of the fiscal relief that the state provided the local government in AB 8 and, for counties, the level of taxable sales within its borders. As a result, individual local government ERAF obligations varied widely. For example, the ERAF shifts from cities formed after 1978 typically were lower than those for older cities because the newer cities did not receive any AB 8 benefits. Similarly, counties with many retail developments typically had larger ERAF shifts than rural counties because the state anticipated that extensively developed counties would receive more relief from the state’s primary ERAF mitigation measure: a half–cent sales tax for local public safety (Proposition 172, 1993). As shown in Figure A–2, after the ERAF transfer of the early 1990s, schools and community colleges once again received more than 50 percent of the state’s property tax revenue, while other local governments received less.\n“Excess ERAF” Shifted Back. In the late 1990s, some county auditors reported that their ERAF accounts had more revenue than necessary to offset all state aid to non–basic aid K–14 districts. In response, the Legislature enacted a law requiring that some of these surplus funds be used for countywide special education programs and the remaining funds be returned to cities, counties, and special districts in proportion to the amount of property taxes that they contributed to ERAF. The ERAF funds that are returned to non–education local governments are known as excess ERAF.\nAdditional Temporary Property Tax Shift. The 2004–05 budget package also shifted $1.3 billion of property taxes from noneducation local agencies (cities, counties, special districts, and redevelopment agencies) to ERAF in 2004–05 and again in 2005–06. This temporary ERAF shift reduced the state’s funding responsibilities for K–14 districts to help address the budget shortfalls in those two years.\nChanges to ERAF\nThe Triple Flip. In 2004, state voters approved Proposition 57, a deficit–financing bond to address the state’s budget shortfall. The state enacted a three–step approach—commonly referred to as the triple flip—that provides a dedicated funding source to repay the deficit bonds:\n- Beginning in 2004–05, one–quarter cent of the local sales tax is used to repay the deficit–financing bond.\n- During the time these bonds are outstanding, city and county revenue losses from the diverted local sales tax are replaced on a dollar–for–dollar basis with property taxes shifted from ERAF.\n- The K–14 tax losses from the redirection of ERAF to cities and counties, in turn, are offset by increased state aid.\nThe triple flip increases the amount of property tax revenue going to cities and counties and reduces the amount of ERAF provided to K–14 districts. Overall, however, cities, counties, and K–14 districts do not experience any net change in revenue from the triple flip. Cities and counties receive more property tax revenue, but this revenue gain is offset by the reduction in sales tax revenue. K–14 districts receive less property tax revenue, but this is offset with increased state aid. The flip of sales taxes for property taxes ends after the deficit–financing bonds are repaid (currently estimated to occur in 2016).\nThe VLF Swap. The VLF—a tax on vehicle ownership—provides revenue to local governments. In 1999, the state began reducing the VLF rate and backfilling city and county revenue losses from this tax reduction with state aid. The 2004–05 budget package permanently replaced the state VLF backfill by diverting property tax revenue from ERAF and, if necessary, non–basic aid K–14 districts to cities and counties. In 2004–05, cities and counties did not experience a change in overall revenue from the VLF swap, as the amount of property tax shifted to them was equal to the VLF backfill amount. In subsequent years, state law specifies that each local government’s VLF swap payment grows based on the annual change in its assessed valuation. As a result, most cities and counties benefit fiscally from the VLF swap because assessed valuation typically grows more quickly than VLF revenue. Similar to the triple flip, K–14 districts’ property tax revenue losses are made up with increased state aid.\nDistributing ERAF\nThe triple flip and VLF swap further expanded the use of ERAF and changed the priorities governing how its resources are used. As shown in Figure A–3, the original purpose of ERAF was to supplement the property tax revenue of non–basic aid K–14 districts. Under current law, however, funding K–14 districts falls to the fourth priority. As a result, non–basic aid school districts do not receive any ERAF resources unless additional funds remain after the county auditor (1) returns excess ERAF, (2) reimburses the triple flip, and (3) make payments for the VLF swap. This change in priorities has a significant effect on the amount of ERAF available for school districts. In 2010–11, for example, auditors in 33 counties reported using all ERAF resources for the first three priorities, leaving no ERAF for schools.\nFigure A–3\nUses of ERAF Listed in Priority Order\n|\nPriority\n|\nEarly 1990s\n|\nLate 1990s to 2004\n|\n2004 to Present\n|\n|\nFirst\n|\nFund non–basic aid K–14 districts\n|\nReturn excess ERAF\n|\nReturn excess ERAF\n|\n|\nSecond\n|\n|\nFund non–basic aid K–14 districts\n|\nReimburse triple flip\n|\n|\nThird\n|\n|\n|\nMake payments for VLF swap\n|\n|\nFourth\n|\n|\n|\nFund non–basic aid K–14 districts\n|\nFigure A–4 displays the complex process county auditors follow to allocate ERAF and to reimburse cities and counties for the triple flip and VLF swap. This figure also shows that, under certain circumstances, it is possible that the auditor could determine that there are not enough funds to fully compensate cities and the county for the triple flip and/or the VLF swap. These funding insufficiencies are referred to as “insufficient ERAF.”\nStep 1: Return Excess ERAF. As shown in the figure, the first step is for each county auditor to determine whether the funds deposited into the countywide account exceed the amount needed by all non–basic aid K–14 districts in the county, plus a specified amount for special education. If so, the excess ERAF is returned to cities, special districts, and the county in proportion to the amount of property taxes they contributed to ERAF. This calculation of excess ERAF was modified recently to reflect the increased revenue that K–14 districts and ERAF receive from the dissolution of redevelopment agencies. Specifically, to maximize the state fiscal benefit related to redevelopment dissolution, Chapter 26, Statues of 2012 (AB 1484, Committee on Budget) directs county auditors to exclude property taxes related to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies in the calculation of excess ERAF.\nStep 2: Reimburse Triple Flip. Following the calculation and distribution of excess ERAF, state law directs county auditors to reimburse local governments for their revenue losses associated with the triple flip. This reimbursement is shown in the figure as step two. If the county auditor uses all available ERAF, but determines that the local governments have not been fully reimbursed for the triple flip, the county has insufficient ERAF. In this situation, additional state action is required if cities and counties are to be fully reimbursed for the triple flip.\nSteps 3 and 4: Pay for VLF Swap. After reimbursing the triple flip, the next use of ERAF is to make payments to local governments for the VLF swap. If the county auditor determines that ERAF resources are not sufficient to fully pay cities and the county for the VLF swap, the county auditor redirects some property taxes from non–basic aid K–14 districts for this purpose, as shown in step 4. The redirection of school property taxes is commonly referred to as negative ERAF because it decreases K–14 property taxes rather than supplementing them (the original purpose of ERAF). If the amount of property taxes deposited in ERAF and allocated to non–basic aid school district is not enough to make the payments required under the VLF swap, then the county has insufficient ERAF. In this situation, additional state action is required for cities and counties to receive the full VLF swap payment. In 2012–13, the first time this issue came before the Legislature, the state included $1.5 million in the budget to compensate the county and cities in Amador County for insufficient ERAF.\nStep 5: Distribute Remaining ERAF to K–14 Districts. Any funds remaining in ERAF after the other uses have been satisfied are distributed to schools and offset state education spending.\nLimits on the State’s Authority Over Property Tax Allocation\nThe state’s use of property tax shifts to help resolve its severe budget difficulties—as well as other actions affecting the state–local fiscal relationship—have been a source of considerable friction between state and local government. In response, local government advocates have sponsored initiatives to limit the state’s authority over local finances, including two constitutional measures reducing the state’s authority over property tax allocation. As a result, much of the authority granted to the state in Proposition 13 and used to establish AB 8, ERAF, the VLF swap, and the triple flip is now restricted.\nProposition 1A (2004)\nIn 2004, voters approved Proposition 1A, amending the State Constitution to prohibit the state from shifting property tax revenue from cities, counties, and special districts to K–14 districts. The measure, however, provided an exception to its restrictions. Beginning in 2008–09, the measure allowed the state to shift a limited amount of local property tax revenue to schools and community colleges provided that the state repaid local governments for their property tax losses, with interest, within three years. The measure also specified that any change in how property tax revenue is shared among cities, counties, and special districts must be approved by two–thirds of both houses of the Legislature (instead of by majority vote). For example, state actions that shift a share of property tax revenue from one local special district to another, or from the county to a city, require approval by two–thirds of both houses of the Legislature.\nThe state utilized Proposition 1A’s exception for shifting property tax revenue to provide state fiscal relief in its 2009–10 budget package. Specifically, the state borrowed $1.9 billion of property tax revenue from cities, counties, and special districts—revenue equal to roughly 8 percent of each local agency’s property tax revenue. (Under Proposition 1A, the state was required to repay these funds by 2012–13. Companion legislation, however, allowed local governments to borrow against the state’s future repayments so that local government budgets were not negatively affected in 2009–10.) The 2009–10 budget package also required redevelopment agencies to make payments totaling $1.7 billion (2009–10) and $350 million (2010–11) to K–12 school districts serving students living in or near their redevelopment areas. Unlike the borrowing from cities, counties, and special districts, the state did not reimburse redevelopment agencies for these required payments.\nProposition 22 (2010)\nIn 2010, voters approved Proposition 22, which, among other things, prohibits the state from redirecting property tax revenue as it did in 2009–10. Specifically, Proposition 22 eliminates the state’s authority to borrow property tax revenue from local governments as previously allowed under Proposition 1A and prohibits the state from requiring redevelopment agencies to shift revenue to K–14 districts or other agencies. As discussed in the nearby box, the prohibition on shifting redevelopment funds contributed indirectly to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies in February 2012.\nProposition 1A and Proposition 22 limit the state’s authority to change property tax allocation laws. Measures that reallocate property tax revenue among counties, cities, and special districts require a two–thirds vote of the Legislature and measures that change state laws to increase the percentage of property taxes allocated to schools are prohibited. Even without additional legislative action, however, the distribution of property tax revenue will change in the near future for two reasons.\nDiscusses the role of property tax agents in appealing property assessments.\nExamines the problems in the current property tax allocation system and discusses the tensions and trade–offs inherent in five reform proposals.\nExplains the mechanics of the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund shift and the formulas which implemented it.\nProvides a timeline summarizing major changes in the state–local relationship.\nAddresses some common questions about the Chapter 9 process for local governments.\nReviews the history of redevelopment agencies, the events that led to their dissolution, and the process communities are using to resolve their financial obligations.\nExamines the Governor’s proposal to end redevelopment.\nDiscusses key events and measures that influenced state–local relations.\nSummarizes key issues related to local government.\nExamines the constitutional requirements related to property assessments and fees.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Between 2000 and 2016, the number of deaths from heart disease due to working long hours increased by 42%, and from stroke by 19%.\nThis work-related disease burden is particularly significant in men (72% of deaths occurred among males), people living in the Western Pacific and South-East Asia regions, and middle-aged or older workers. Most of the deaths recorded were among people dying aged 60-79 years, who had worked for 55 hours or more per week between the ages of 45 and 74 years.\nWith working long hours now known to be responsible for about one-third of the total estimated work-related burden of disease, it is established as the risk factor with the largest occupational disease burden. This shifts thinking towards a relatively new and more psychosocial occupational risk factor to human health.\nThe study concludes that working 55 or more hours per week is associated with an estimated 35% higher risk of a stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from ischemic heart disease, compared to working 35-40 hours a week.\nFurther, the number of people working long hours is increasing, and currently stands at 9% of the total population globally. This trend puts even more people at risk of work-related disability and early death.\nThe new analysis comes as the COVID-19 pandemic shines a spotlight on managing working hours; the pandemic is accelerating developments that could feed the trend towards increased working time.\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the way many people work,“ said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"Teleworking has become the norm in many industries, often blurring the boundaries between home and work. In addition, many businesses have been forced to scale back or shut down operations to save money, and people who are still on the payroll end up working longer hours. No job is worth the risk of stroke or heart disease. Governments, employers and workers need to work together to agree on limits to protect the health of workers.”\n“Working 55 hours or more per week is a serious health hazard,” added Dr Maria Neira, Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health, at the World Health Organization. “It’s time that we all, governments, employers, and employees wake up to the fact that long working hours can lead to premature death”.\nGovernments, employers and workers can take the following actions to protect workers’ health:\n- governments can introduce, implement and enforce laws, regulations and policies that ban mandatory overtime and ensure maximum limits on working time;\n- bipartite or collective bargaining agreements between employers and workers’ associations can arrange working time to be more flexible, while at the same time agreeing on a maximum number of working hours;\n- employees could share working hours to ensure that numbers of hours worked do not climb above 55 or more per week.\nNote for editors:\nTwo systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the latest evidence were conducted for this study. Data from 37 studies on ischemic heart disease covering more than 768 000 participants and 22 studies on stroke covering more than 839 000 participants were synthesized. The study covered global, regional and national levels, and was based on data from more than 2300 surveys collected in 154 countries from 1970-2018.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Summary\n- Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 is the world’s largest standalone public opinion survey on climate change.\n- The survey examined how people are experiencing the impacts of climate change and how they want world leaders to respond.\n- More than half of people globally said they were more worried about climate change now than last year, and four out of five want their countries to strengthen commitments to address climate change.\n- Survey results show high levels of support for a range of climate actions, including nature restoration, rapid transition from fossil fuels and climate education in schools.\n- The results provide decision-makers with a reliable, inclusive and comprehensive snapshot of how climate change is affecting the world’s population.\nHow do people around the world view climate change?\nAs climate change continues to drive a rise in record-breaking heat and more frequent and intense extreme weather events, people around the world are becoming increasingly concerned.\nAccording to Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024, the world’s largest standalone public opinion survey on climate change, people everywhere are experiencing climate change in increasingly disruptive ways.\nThe results of the survey, which statistically represent 87 percent of the world’s population, show that climate change is on people’s minds everywhere. Globally, 56 percent said they were thinking about it daily or weekly.\nAdditionally, 53 percent of people worldwide are more worried about climate change now than they were a year earlier. This is most likely linked to the increasing number of climate change impacts that people hear about or have experienced themselves. More than two out of five people (43 percent) think extreme weather events were worse this year than last. Nearly eight in 10 people (78 percent) want more protection for people at risk from extreme weather.\nStrikingly, almost two thirds (63 percent) are starting to take climate change impacts into consideration when making decisions like where to live or work and what to buy. A third of people (33 percent) said climate change is affecting their big life decisions a lot.\nHow do people think leaders should respond to the climate crisis?\nFour out of five people around the world (80 percent) want more climate action from their country. They also seek global unity in responding to the crisis, with 86 percent agreeing that their countries should set aside geopolitical differences, such as those regarding trade and security, and work together on climate change.\nThere is a clear expectation that governments need to lead and strengthen their commitments to address climate change, with a resounding 89 percent of people wanting to see more climate action from their governments. At the same time, only 39 percent of people think big businesses are doing well in addressing climate change.\nWhen asked about different measures to respond to the climate crisis, 81 percent of people support the protection and restoration of nature, highlighting the importance of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems in limiting climate change. Climate education is another measure that received a lot of public support, with 80 percent of people backing the role of schools in increasing awareness.\nMost people agree that business-as-usual is no longer an option to keep the world on a safe path. Worldwide, 72 percent support a quick transition away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. Even in the world’s biggest producers of fossil fuels, the majority of people support a quick transition away from coal, oil and gas.\nLast but not least, four in five people (79 percent) expressed support for climate justice, agreeing that rich countries should increase the help given to poorer countries to address climate change and its impacts.\nAre there any differences in the way people think about climate change based on their background?\nThere is a large consensus on the results of Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024. That is to say, the vast majority of people agree the climate crisis is here and that the world needs to act now.\nStill, there are a few exceptions.\nGiven that climate change impacts are most acutely felt in countries will less resilience – who are often the least responsible for causing the crisis – more people in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) think about climate change regularly (63 percent) than the global average (56 percent).\nFurthermore, as the climate crisis is an existential threat to Small Island Developing States (SIDS), it is not surprising that 71 percent of people in SIDS are more worried about climate change now than last year, a much higher percent than the global average (53 percent).\nThe survey revealed support for stronger climate action in 20 of the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters, but majorities range from 66 percent in the United States and Russia, to 67 percent in Germany, 73 percent in China, 77 percent in South Africa and India, 85 percent in Brazil, 88 percent in Iran and up to 93 percent in Italy.\nWhen it comes to differences based on gender, in five of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters (Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United States), women are more in favor of strengthening their country’s climate action commitments by 10 to 17 percentage points. This gap was biggest in Germany, where women were 17 percentage points more likely than men to want more climate action (75 percent compared to 58 percent).\nHow does understanding people’s views on climate change help in addressing it?\nThe results of Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 can help national decision-makers develop ambitious policies to address climate change and engage key stakeholders by helping them understand which challenges are affecting people and what is expected of them. As the survey shows, some of these expectations include acting fast to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, offering increased protection from extreme weather events, protecting and restoring nature, closing gaps in climate education and offering increased support for the world’s most vulnerable.\nThe results should serve as a resource for national and local leaders to develop inclusive and ambitious climate strategies and action plans tailored to the specific needs, concerns and challenges of their citizens – including through updating their national climate pledges (known as Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs). International climate summits, such as the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), are also great opportunities for governments to translate the survey results into pathways to climate action.\nIn many of the places surveyed by Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024, this type of data can be difficult to collect due to barriers such as conflict, limited access to technology or geographic inaccessibility. Many of the countries polled have never been asked for their views on climate change in such depth before, especially developing countries that have contributed the least emissions and are on the frontlines of the crisis.\nHow can you use Peoples’ Climate Vote?\nWhile government campaigns and initiatives are critical for enacting climate action at scale, citizen’s climate movements can pressure leaders to keep their ambitions high. The Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 is an important tool that you can use to urge climate action.\nHere are some suggestions on how you can make best use of Peoples’ Climate Vote:\n- Share the link to the Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 with friends, family, faith and community members, professional networks and business leaders, so they can see the findings for themselves.\n- Start a conversation at the dinner table. See what people around you think and tell them how they compare to the rest of the world.\n- Inform and involve people on climate issues by using your social media channels as an amplifier for the results from the Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024.\n- Incorporate the survey results in letters, petitions and other correspondence to urge elected officials to support and drive increased climate action.\n- Cite the Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 data and results in your own campaigns and research.\nAbout Peoples’ Climate Vote\nThe Peoples’ Climate Vote is the world’s largest standalone public opinion survey on climate change, created to deliver people’s perspectives on climate change to world leaders. Launched in 2020, the first edition of the Peoples’ Climate Vote was developed as a pillar of UNDP’s Mission 1.5 campaign to connect people and their policymakers.\nThe Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 is the second edition of this global survey, bigger and more inclusive than before. More than 73,000 people speaking 87 different languages across 77 countries participated in the survey, which was conducted for UNDP by the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom and GeoPoll, a global leader in remote research.\nThe 2024 edition aimed to find out exactly how people are experiencing climate change in their day-to-day lives. The 15 questions were designed specifically so that they could be easily understood across different education levels and cultural backgrounds in 77 countries. They focused on people’s personal experiences with the impacts of climate change, what they would like the world to do about it, and how much further or faster they want leaders to go in responding to it.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Concerned Americans demand an explanation of how this happened and leadership that will walk us back from the cliff. But in the White House and along the campaign trail, the purported leaders fail to recognize or refuse to acknowledge the clear and present threat to our economy: the Great Deflation.\nThe failure to differentiate between an economic recession and this Great Deflation will cause an economically doomed generation.\nBut this need not happen. The strength of our economy -- its capacity to generate employment, opportunity, and growth -- is determined by the quality of its factories and its technology and innovation; by the depth and freedom of its marketplace; and by the ingenuity and efforts of its people. By these measures, we Americans should continue to have the strongest economy in history, and one which continues to grow.\nSo while our economic challenges are daunting, they can be surmounted. It is only a question of our will to take action.\nCrux of our problem\nFor many years, a cancer grew in our economy -- a rapid rise in government spending and debt; an explosion of debt in our banking system spawned by irresponsible leveraging and fueled by in-flows of savings from China and elsewhere; and a rapid rise in home-mortgage debt driven by unsustainable increases in home prices wrought by a massive increase in leverage and lending by government-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and by unscrupulous lending practices. In 2008, this debt cancer decimated our financial system.\nPanicking amid this crisis, Washington got it wrong. Instead of reining in government spending, requiring banks to reduce their indebtedness, and providing a plan to help struggling homeowners cope with their debt, Washington made matters worse by:\n- Using taxpayer money to bail out the managers, shareholders, and creditors of banks, and not requiring the failed, bailed-out banks to restructure to reduce their indebtedness. Washington passed TARP to protect bank bondholders and shareholders from suffering losses -- and used your money and the money printed by the Federal Reserve to do it. As a result, while bank bondholders and shareholders were made whole (by the taxpayer), the banks remain over-indebted and cannot lend to new businesses. In fact, since 2008 we have been living through the very first period in modern American history in which banks have actually reduced the amount of money they lend. Now, small businesses, innovators, and workers -- the primary job generators -- lack sufficient access to credit to finance economic expansion and job creation.\n- Massively expanding the federal government's size and spending on misguided and failed \"fiscal stimulus.\" In consequence, ratings agencies have downgraded the once premier \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government. Now, it will cost our government much more to borrow money to pay its bills. This is a national disgrace, and it will cost us dearly if we do not fully restore our credit rating.\n- Ignoring the problems created by massive home foreclosures. These include the devastating impact on families who lost their homes, falling home values in neighborhoods blighted by foreclosures, and the negative impact on the economy of families forced to drastically reduce their purchases of goods and services from our producers.\n- Ignoring our trade deficit with Communist China and its predatory, mercantilist trade practices -- including selling us subsidized manufactured goods and, instead of buying our goods, hoarding our money and lending it to our government and our banks.\n- Engaging in a policy of \"quantitative easing.\" While we are in a period of \"debt-deflation\" -- a vicious circle of falling asset prices begetting debt defaults, and requirements for more collateral on loans begetting yet further asset-price declines -- the Federal Reserve's policy of monetary expansion has not spurred the economy and risks eventually igniting inflation, with all of its ill effects.\nThe solution\nWith our stagnant economy burdened by Washington's failed responses to the Great Deflation, we must immediately commence rectifying these mistakes:\n- We must rein in government spending in a transparent and credible way. A good start would be to immediately convene the deficit-reduction committee appointed as part of the debt-ceiling deal, and ask them to quickly adopt a no-gimmicks, honest set of cost reductions that will restore investor confidence in the fiscal responsibility of the U.S. government. The members of this committee should rise above partisanship and perform their task as patriotic Americans in a time of crisis. This will inspire confidence and increase investment in the U.S. economy, which will spur job growth.\n- We must require our banks to immediately reduce their indebtedness -- so they have the capital to resume lending to our small businesses -- and without any more taxpayer money. If a bank cannot raise more equity capital by selling shares, then it must convert some of its non-depositor debt into equity -- even if this causes bondholders and shareholders to suffer losses. Banks should be required to have 20 percent of their assets in the form of readily available capital (tier 1 capital, Basel III definition), 15 percent of it in the form of shareholder equity. Once the banks have achieved this goal, they will not only have sufficient non-debt capital to resume lending, but they will have a large equity cushion that will make taxpayer bailouts unnecessary in the future.\n- We need to resolve our mortgage crisis. Nearly 30 percent of homeowners have mortgages that exceed the value of their home. This is not necessarily their fault, as we have lived through the largest decline in home values in our history. Life savings have been wiped out. We need to take action to stop this devastation. When lenders foreclose on homes, they typically suffer losses that exceed 30 percent of the value of the home Therefore, we need a voluntary program to offer homeowners a deal whereby, in exchange for reducing their mortgage debt to a level equal to 90 percent of home value, they would commit to pay their lender half of any future sale or refinance proceeds they receive.\nThis should not cost the lenders anything, because they would save on foreclosure costs (through reduced foreclosures), and gain from future appreciation in the value of the homes. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently own over half of home mortgages and are controlled by the federal government, should immediately make this offer to all their customers, and our bank regulators should adopt a rule assuring any bank that makes this offer to its mortgage borrowers that it will not suffer a reduction in the regulatory capital value of the mortgage. Any issues arising from implementing this proposal for mortgage-securities pools should be addressed so as to remove the obstacle. This plan will end the devastating foreclosure fever and stem the erosion of home values, once and for all.\n4. We need to comprehensively combat Communist China's predatory trade practices, including its currency manipulation, which unfairly enables its manufacturers to undercut our manufacturers and allows the PRC to accumulate savings that fuel debt in our financial system.\nOnce implemented, these urgent reforms will mark the beginning of the end of the Great Deflation; and the end of the beginning of restoring our prosperity and affirming American exceptionalism in the 21st century.\nBio: U.S. Representative Thaddeus McCotter represents the 11th District of Michigan, and is seeking the Republican nomination for president.

In the face of income losses and unexpected expenses, households are not able to quickly adjust housing consumption. Homeowners cannot immediately sell homes and face large transaction costs in refinancing and modifying mortgages. While renters are more mobile, they typically hold leases that commit them to paying rent over a full year. Furthermore, low-income housing production programs in the United States tend to be pro-cyclical.\nThis paper proposes a set of policy reforms that would add automatic stabilizers to federal housing programs, helping both renters and homeowners stay in their homes during economic downturns and ensuring continued support for the construction and renovation of affordable housing. Specifically, we propose creating new emergency rental assistance accounts for low-income households to address the income and financial shocks that can trigger housing instability; an automatic homeownership stabilization program, consisting of a three-month forbearance period for vulnerable mortgage borrowers in response to a triggering event of elevated local unemployment; and a permanent tax credit exchange program that allows states to exchange tax credits for direct subsidies at a fiscally neutral price when demand from tax credit investors falls. We discuss several design and implementation questions, and acknowledge limitations. Nevertheless, and despite these limitations, these proposals would go a long way toward stabilizing households and housing markets during the next crisis.\nIntroduction\nMost of the research and policy discussion around housing concerns long-term affordability. This focus is understandable. Housing costs account for a far more significant part of a household’s budget today than they did even a few decades ago. In 1960, just one in four renters in the United States and in 1980, just one in seven homeowners paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs (the standard measure of housing cost burden). By 2016 nearly half of renters and a quarter of homeowners were housing cost burdened (see figure 1). These shares are down slightly from their peak following the Great Recession, but they remain far higher than they were in the past century. Cost burdens have not only risen in New York, San Francisco and other coastal, high-cost metro areas; the share of renters burdened by housing costs has also risen by more than 13 percentage points between 1970 and 2016 in every one of the 50 largest metropolitan areas (Ellen, Lubell, Willis 2021).\nBut the focus on long-term affordability misses another critical challenge for housing policy: the occurrence of cyclical (and idiosyncratic) shocks to income and expenses that strain households’ short-term budgets and their ability to cover housing costs. In other words, many households who can afford their homes over the long run could face individual months when they are unable to afford them. To be sure, long-run and short-term affordability are related. The secular decline in affordability makes it more difficult for households to accumulate savings and makes covering monthly housing bills more onerous. Few households have the savings needed to easily smooth consumption through income or financial shocks. The Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) asks respondents whether they would be able to cover three months of expenses by borrowing money, using savings, selling assets, or borrowing from friends and family. As shown in figure 2, the share of respondents saying they would not be able to cover three months of expenses using all available sources was nearly a third in 2014, and fell only slightly to 29 percent in 2019. With such limited resources, even small shocks to income or expenses can put households at risk of eviction, foreclosure, or other involuntary moves.\nUnfortunately, such shocks are common. McKernan et al. (2016) analyze data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and find that, during 2012, about one in four families suffered some type of income disruption such as job loss, a health-related work limitation, or an income drop of at least 50 percent. Low-income families appear to be more vulnerable to income declines. More than a fifth of low-income families experienced a drop in income of 50 percent or more over a four month period, compared with 15.8 percent of middle-income and 15.9 percent of higher-income families. Using data on financial transactions from JPMorgan Chase from 2012 to 2015, Farrell and Greig (2016) also report substantial volatility and find that the lowest earners experienced the most volatility in their income. Looking over time, Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel (2012) find that household income volatility grew between the early 1970s and the late 2000s, with the share of households experiencing an income decline of at least 50 percent over a two-year period rising from about 7 percent in the early 1970s to more than 12 percent in the early 2000s.\nIncome declines are of course even more pronounced during economic downturns like the one we are currently experiencing. As shown in figure 3, the unemployment rate in the United States rose to 14.7 percent in April 2020, and although it fell in the subsequent months, it remained at 6.2 percent in February 2021, substantially elevated above the less than 4 percent unemployment rate seen throughout 2019. Unemployment rates were far higher for Black and Hispanic populations: as of February 2021, the unemployment rates for Black and Hispanic adults were 9.9 and 8.5 percent, respectively, compared to 5.6 and 5.1 percent for white and Asian adults.\nExpense or financial shocks are even more common than unemployment spells or income shocks. According to Pew’s Survey of American Family Finances, 60 percent of households had experienced a financial shock—such as unexpected home maintenance, car repairs, or medical expenses— in the past year (Pew Charitable Trusts 2015). For the median household earning less than $25,000, these shocks amounted to about a month of income, compared to 10 days of income for households earning more than $85,000. And these financial shocks appear to have serious consequences. About two-thirds of low-income households facing financial shocks also experienced financial shortfalls over the year, such as missing a housing payment or other bill.\nOne of the expenses many households are unable to cover is housing payments. According to the American Housing Survey (AHS), 7 percent of renters were unable to pay their full rent in 2017, and cost-burdened renters were nearly twice as likely to report being unable to pay their full rent. More than 800,000 renters reported being threatened with an eviction in just the three months prior to the survey date, suggesting that as many as 3 million were threatened with an eviction over the course of that year. And this distress was during 2017, when the economy was relatively strong. Between December 9 and 21, 2020, 19 percent of renter households responding to the Census Pulse Survey reported being behind on their rent payments.\nHomeowners face instability too, though not as many of them. In 2017 6 percent of homeowners with mortgages who responded to the AHS reported being somewhat or very likely to be forced out of a home within two months due to a foreclosure. Figure 4 shows the time series of loans in serious delinquency (90 days or more) and foreclosure from 2000 through 2020. This figure highlights the dramatic increase in homeowner distress and foreclosure during the housing boom and bust, the post-crisis recovery period, and the recent spike in defaults during the COVID-19 pandemic. While foreclosures did not rise as much as many feared they would during 2020 (thanks to the policy responses discussed below), the December Census Pulse Survey suggests that 11 percent of homeowners with mortgages were behind on their mortgage payments.\nUnfortunately, these evictions and foreclosures carry collateral consequences; for instance, they make it more difficult for people to obtain new homes and even new jobs. Housing instability can depress earnings, undermine health, and worsen credit (Collinson et al. 2021). Furthermore, during downturns, such housing stresses can have systemic effects. Finally, evictions and foreclosures have a racially disparate toll. Eviction and foreclosure risks appear to be heightened for households of color. Consider that, of the 806,000 renters who reported being threatened with an eviction in the past three months in the 2017 AHS, 39 percent were Black (and no other race), while only 21 percent of surveyed renters were Black (and no other race). Regarding foreclosures, research by Houghwout et al. (2020) finds sharply higher foreclosure rates in predominantly Black and Hispanic ZIP codes, especially during the Great Recession; those high rates have persisted thereafter.\nWhile many social insurance programs in the United States are countercyclical, with support automatically rising with demand, housing programs are not. We make the case for three sets of policy reforms that would help to automatically stabilize the housing market during downturns, permitting renters and homeowners to stay in their homes, and allowing the construction and renovation of affordable housing to continue during downturns.\nBackground: Justifications for Intervention\nUnemployment insurance and other social insurance programs are critical in helping to buffer the effect of economic downturns. But these programs have many gaps in coverage: they fail to cover everyone and fail to protect against many common shocks such as lost hours at work, the dissolution of a relationship, or an emergency expense, which are often triggers to housing instability. When people face income losses or unexpected expenses, they can cut back on much of their consumption. But households are not able to quickly adjust housing consumption. Renters typically hold leases that commit them to paying rent over a full year. Even if they are able to get out of their lease, they face high transaction costs in finding and moving to a new home. Transaction costs for homeowners are even higher. Selling and buying homes are lengthy and costly processes. Furthermore, homeowners face substantial frictions in refinancing or modifying their mortgages or in requesting forbearance from their lender.\nGrowing evidence shows that housing instability is costly to individual families, neighborhoods, and even the overall economy. Most housing instability stems from economic distress. This fact makes it difficult to disentangle the role of unstable housing from adverse events that typically trigger it. Two recent studies shed new light on the effects of eviction and foreclosure on the outcomes of individuals and families facing such hardship. Collinson et al. (2021) link housing court records from two major urban centers to administrative data and use a quasi-experimental research design leveraging the random assignment of eviction cases to judges to study the causal consequences of eviction. They find that although eviction is preceded by a variety of markers of economic distress—including falling earnings and employment, and rising unpaid bills—eviction itself also contributes to lower earnings, reduced access to credit, increased hospital visits, and a spike in homeless shelter use in the two years following a case.\nRelated work by Diamond, Guren, and Tan (2020) uses a similar research design examines the effects of foreclosure on residential mobility, financial and household strain for homeowners, renters that are foreclosed upon, and landlords. For homeowners, those authors find that foreclosure increases divorces, financial strain, and moves to lower-income neighborhoods. There is also evidence that foreclosure may contribute to adverse health events and undermine children’s educational progress (Been et al. 2011; Currie and Tekin 2015). These papers suggest substantial costs to individuals and families from losing their homes.\nBeyond the direct effects on individuals and families, housing instability can also generate spillover effects on the surrounding community. A number of studies have explored the effects of foreclosures on the nearby properties and the surrounding neighborhood. This work finds that concentrated foreclosure increases neighborhood crime (Ellen et al. 2013) and lowers the value of nearby property (Anenberg and Kung 2014; Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak 2011; Gerardi et al. 2015).\nFinally, acute housing instability such as eviction or foreclosure can generate a sizable fiscal externality borne by local governments. Increases in homelessness as a result of eviction or foreclosure can be quite costly for local communities, and can lead to increased expenditures on homeless shelters, emergency medical care, criminal justice, and potentially elementary and middle schools that are strained by student mobility. Additionally, reduced rental revenues and foreclosures can depress housing values and the local property tax base, making it more difficult for communities to finance basic public services.\nThe housing market’s enormous size and interconnectedness with so many segments of the economy, including financial markets and real construction activity, have led some macroeconomists to conclude that the housing sector is the critical driver of the business cycle (e.g., Leamer 2015). The mass foreclosure episode of the Great Recession revealed weaknesses in the financial system when opaque credit losses in mortgage-backed securities triggered the near collapse of the banking system and a global recession. In short, the highly levered housing sector poses a systemic risk to the macroeconomy.\nAddressing this systemic risk requires further government intervention in a market already heavily influenced by federal participants. During the Great Recession, the federal government covered losses suffered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), in addition to other financial institutions, in part because of limited options for dealing with large volumes of distressed borrowers and an inability to systematically prevent widespread default-price spirals. The costs to taxpayers were enormous (on the order of $370 billion, according to Lucas 2019), so finding automatic approaches to avoid or attenuate further housing crises would reduce taxpayer exposure.\nChallenge: Inadequacy of Current Policies\nUnfortunately, our current suite of housing policies is simply not up to the task of addressing housing insecurity and its follow-on costs. Below we explain how low-income rental assistance, support for homeowners, and affordable housing production programs all fall short in stabilizing households and markets during economic downturns.\nLow-Income Renters\nMuch federal housing support for low-income renters is devoted to long-term subsidy programs that provide recurring assistance to participants through programs such as housing choice vouchers, public housing, and project-based rental assistance. These programs serve only a small fraction of the eligible households—typically around one in four—and are massively oversubscribed. Since these programs are not entitlements, their expansion or contraction depends not on changing needs or macroeconomic conditions, but rather on the whims of discretionary federal spending. As a result, nominal spending on rental assistance has remained essentially flat for the past 18 years, despite large swings in the national economy (see figure 5).\nWhile real rents tend to stagnate or fall in periods of economic downturn, this softening rarely offsets the impact of lost wages, unemployment, or rising poverty, leaving demand for housing assistance elevated during recessions (Lens 2018). Moreover, as the economy weakens fewer households exit the major housing programs voluntarily, resulting in fewer new vouchers being issued or subsidized units becoming available. This pattern, coupled with stagnant per capita spending, means that housing assistance is typically scarcer during a recession than in periods of greater economic prosperity. By contrast, other parts of the safety net strengthen during recessions, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which grows or contracts in response to local economic conditions (Ganong and Liebman 2018); or unemployment insurance, which automatically expands when joblessness rises (see figure 5).\nThe current system of administering housing assistance is not responsive to changing macroeconomic needs, and it is also not designed well to adjust to changing individual circumstances. Individuals and families facing acute needs often must wait years to get an offer of federal housing assistance. Therefore, the timing of when households actually receive assistance rarely lines up with the period when assistance is needed most. Forcing prospective clients to endure long waits could lead some applicants to drop off waiting lists because they are unable to maintain contact with a housing authority. The prospect of multiyear waits might deter those with the most immediate need for housing from applying for assistance altogether.\nFor households already receiving housing assistance, programs are theoretically set up to increase the aid provided to such households when they encounter economic setbacks. Rent rules for vouchers, public housing, and project-based rental assistance programs all tie the amount of subsidy a family receives to their most recently certified income. This means that, if a household experiences a meaningful loss of income, they can recertify their income with their housing authority, and reduce the size of their required rent contribution (thereby increasing their housing subsidy). Additionally, for individuals lucky enough to be issued a voucher, it may be easier to find a landlord willing to lease to them during an economic downturn, when vacancy rates are typically higher (Finkel and Buron 2001).\nAlthough the current system of administering the major rental assistance programs is not tailored to address individual-level shocks, the federal government does attempt to provide some housing assistance for vulnerable individuals and families experiencing economic insecurity, assistance that responds to more-urgent needs. The Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) program, which is part of the larger suite of block grants that the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) uses to address homelessness, provides funds to local communities to support rapid rehousing programs as well as the operations of emergency shelters. The ESG is a relatively small block grant, however, and local communities must divide it across several important uses: emergency shelter operation, homelessness prevention, rapid rehousing, street outreach, and management of homeless information systems.\nDue to funding constraints, the availability of emergency assistance for clients applying for such assistance often fluctuates dramatically over time (Evans, Sullivan, and Wallskog 2016). The ESG program could be expanded to cover a wider segment of vulnerable renters. The CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act allocated $4 billion for the ESG program to prevent housing instability and homelessness during the early stages of the pandemic. As a part of this allocation, HUD waived or altered existing program requirements for ESG such as lifting the income eligibility from 30 percent to 50 percent of the area median income (AMI) and expanded the allowable length of rapid rehousing assistance.\nHomeowners\nHomeowners experiencing an income shock confront the same challenges with making regular mortgage payments as renters. However, homeowners face a different set of incentives for maintaining housing stability relative to renters. Unlike renters, homeowners have a long-term obligation, often consisting of a 30-year fully amortizing mortgage that they are paying off gradually. They may also have equity built up in their homes, as the difference between the home value and the outstanding mortgage often represents many families’ largest asset. This long-term commitment, combined with the incentive to protect equity in their homes, makes it essential for homeowners to find ways to continue making payments and avoid foreclosure (or forced sale) in the midst of a temporary disruption to household income.\nHomeowners also face a different institutional context when they encounter difficulties with making their mortgage payments. Rather than interacting directly with a landlord, homeowners instead interact with mortgage servicers as intermediary representatives. These servicers sometimes have discretion over temporary payment leniency or more permanent modifications, but are often constrained and incentivized by the contractual relationship (called a pooling and servicing agreement, or PSA) between the servicer and the financial entity that holds the mortgage. These agreements often limit renegotiation options for borrowers and set forth strict timelines for initiating foreclosure proceedings. In addition to federal policy and guidelines, the rules of foreclosure also depend crucially on state laws regarding the judicial process.\nThe experience of the Great Recession revealed enormous failures of both policy and imagination; few expected that house prices would fall nationwide, overwhelming servicer capacity for workouts and triggering a wave of foreclosures. Prior to the Great Recession, there were no programs of a meaningful size to protect homeowners who fell behind on payments (Amromin, Bhutta, and Keys 2020). Instead, distressed homeowners had to seek payment adjustments on their own in a one-off renegotiation with their servicer.\nServicers most commonly can provide some form of forbearance, which allows a borrower to pause or reduce payments temporarily. In some instances, servicers can offer a temporary or permanent modification to features of the mortgage contract, such as reducing the interest rate or extending the loan term.\nHomeowners thus had to engage in idiosyncratic workout arrangements, each negotiated separately. Many servicers refrained from offering generous workouts, or homeowners were not aware of their options, and foreclosure rates rose between 2005 and 2007, and then spiked in 2010 (see figure 4).\nThe federal government plays an outsized role in the mortgage market in the United States even in good times, but during periods of distress government programs played a crucial role in keeping families in their homes. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) was set up in 2009 to expand and standardize modifications for homeowners experiencing financial hardship. The program reduced borrowers’ payments and provided substantial financial incentives to encourage renegotiation. As shown by Agarwal et al. (2017), while the program indeed prevented a sizable number of foreclosures, enrolling more than 1 million homeowners into permanent modifications, its overall effectiveness (intended to help 3 million to 4 million homeowners) was hampered by servicer-specific capacity issues and general reluctance to fully participate in this voluntary program. The parameters of the program were relaxed in 2012 to broaden the set of renegotiations considered to have positive net present value from the perspective of the servicers, but by this point the foreclosure wave had already crested, with devastating results.\nIn addition to being dependent on the capacity and inclination of servicers, the program was only available to owner-occupied properties, neglecting small landlords. HAMP was also only an option for homeowners with a mortgage owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, leaving roughly one-third of all homeowners excluded from federal modification assistance. An additional limitation of the program was the focus on permanent modification to a temporary problem, including in some cases the writing down of the principal balance outstanding on the mortgage (discussed in more detail below).\nOn homeownership, the swift and near-universal COVID response represents the smart implementation of lessons learned from the Great Recession. Rather than setting up a complex voluntary program that was too slow and too limited to prevent millions of foreclosures, the FHA, Veterans Affairs (VA), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac quickly rolled out a forbearance program that paused payments and froze foreclosure proceedings among these federally backed loans. The program was timely, generous, and widespread, providing an initial forbearance of up to 180 days with the possibility of extending for another 180. Servicers have been directed to report to the credit bureaus that loans that were current prior to the forbearance period continue to report loans as current, preventing any harm to borrowers’ credit scores. The government mortgage providers have largely given consistent guidance and have adjusted their timelines, extending forbearance lengths and foreclosure moratoria to align with the duration of the COVID crisis thus far.\nIn all, COVID relief for homeowners provided by government mortgage agencies has been a success. Forbearance programs expanded sharply at the onset of the COVID pandemic, peaking at 8.5 percent of all outstanding mortgages in June, gradually declining to 5.5 percent of all mortgages in December (DeSantis 2020, ibid 2020). Some questions remain regarding whether the relief will continue until the economy is fully recovered, and what form repayment will take when forbearance expires.\nThe relief has been incomplete for the mortgage market on two critical dimensions, however. First, the relief helps only those borrowers with federally backed loans. As discussed by Kaul (2020), roughly 3 million mortgage loans that are not federally backed are held in either bank portfolios or private-label securities. In the absence of access to federal COVID relief, these borrowers must renegotiate with their servicers, who are again constrained by capacity and the requirements of their pooling and servicing agreements. These agreements may provide servicers with only limited discretion or guidance for enacting large-scale forbearance, as during the Great Recession. While reportedly the private market has improved the design of these agreements, receiving relief during COVID remains an idiosyncratic process for these borrowers with privately held loans, although the borrowers are not at fault for the lack of standardized procedure.\nSecond, and importantly for our context, receiving COVID relief requires action on the part of the mortgage borrower, who must actively request forbearance from their servicer. As of September 28, 2020, an estimated 400,000 mortgage borrowers were “needlessly delinquent”—meaning they were eligible for COVID-related relief but were not receiving it because enrollment requires active participation (Neal and Goodman 2020). The Urban Institute’s examination of Ginnie Mae data (which covers FHA/VA loans) of loans that were current in March 2020 but at least 30 days delinquent by July 2020 found no observable mortgage contract characteristics that predicted which homeowners were failing to respond to generous federal relief offers and repeated outreach (Neal and Goodman 2020).\nWhile forbearance has been widely available to mortgage borrowers, survey evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of borrowers remain confused about both eligibility requirements and the benefits of forbearance. Analyzing the January 2021 COVID-19 Survey of Consumers conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Consumer Finance Institute, Lambie-Hanson, Vickery, and Akana (2021) find that 17 percent of those surveyed who did not use forbearance may have needed forbearance but did not understand how to apply for it or how it would affect their total payment due, their credit records, or their payment schedule. A lack of understanding, combined with the necessity of action on the part of the borrower, has represented a substantial barrier to take-up for many struggling homeowners.\nThis failure to take up generous mortgage relief benefits parallels findings in other settings, including mortgage refinancing opportunities. During downturns, monetary policy creates a valuable option for homeowners to refinance at lower mortgage interest rates (see, e.g., Beraja et al. 2019; Berger et al. 2020; Bhutta and Keys 2016). Refinancing requires substantial effort on the part of homeowners, however, and many do not qualify during a downturn because of income, credit score, or home value re-underwriting (DeFusco and Mondragon 2020). Additional studies have found support for behavioral explanations of failing to refinance, including issues related to misinformation, lack of trust, inattention, and inertia (Andersen et al. 2020; Johnson, Meier, and Toubia 2019; Keys, Pope, and Pope 2016).\nAn alternative approach to temporary homeowners’ assistance was explored in the Great Recession when the US Treasury created the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) in February 2010. The HHF targeted homeowners who had experienced an employment or income shock and offered temporary payment assistance directly to servicers until the homeowner was reemployed, or had exhausted available benefits. Participation in the program required homeowners to actively apply for assistance and required servicers to actively cooperate. Moulton et al. (2020) provide the first evaluation of the HHF, and find that the program spent nearly $7 billion on direct assistance to struggling homeowners, and that it sharply reduced the rate of foreclosures and produced a net social benefit of $2 billion (not incorporating the spillover effects on the prices of nearby properties, which could be substantial). The program appears to be a significant success story; it provided targeted support to the population that needed it at the time in order to avoid the worst outcome, but nonetheless it required substantial outlays and active decision-making on the part of both homeowners and servicers.\nIn sum, the past two recessions have seen significant expansions of stabilizing programs for homeowners, who can now receive federal support, renegotiate independently with servicers, or exercise refinance options. These programs, especially at the federal level, have been expanded during the COVID crisis, although there is uncertainty about what will happen when foreclosure moratoria and forbearance programs run out, and what types of modifications will be available for homeowners.\nCrucially, all this support requires action on the part of policymakers to develop and administer programs in the midst of a crisis, and requires action on the part of homeowners to either reach out to servicers in order to arrange for relief or to contact mortgage providers to initiate a refinancing of their mortgage. Furthermore, this support is not universally available to all mortgage borrowers, many of whom are unaware of whether their mortgage loan is federally backed. These limitations and active requirements create meaningful delays in provision and problematic gaps in support.\nProduction and Preservation of Low-Income Housing\nAs unemployment rates rise and incomes fall, the need for affordable housing naturally grows, and so does the need for the jobs that housing production and renovation create. Yet, if anything, our current affordable housing programs provide less support for the production and renovation of affordable housing during downturns. The private credit market, which affordable housing developers rely on for credit, typically tightens underwriting and cuts back on lending during downturns. And the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), the primary source of public subsidy for producing and preserving affordable housing, also tends to be pro-cyclical.\nEnacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, LIHTC supports the construction or rehabilitation of more than 100,000 units every year (HUD 2020). The federal government issues tax credits to states, who then allocate them to developers of affordable housing projects. Developers typically sell tax credits to corporate investors, which reduces the amount of debt their projects need to support and allows them to charge lower rents. Unfortunately, during downturns, when those corporate investors anticipate less taxable income and therefore less ability to use tax credits, demand for tax credits falls.\nIndeed, during the Great Recession the price of tax credits plummeted to about $0.60 per dollar of tax credits, creating significant gaps in funding for thousands of projects that had unsold tax credit allocations and had counted on a price of about $0.90 per dollar (Joint Center for Housing Studies 2009). Tighter underwriting and reduced lending on the part of private lenders further amplified the subsidy shortfalls.\nThe vulnerability of the tax credit is arguably compounded by the fact that the investor base is narrow. While individual taxpayers and privately owned businesses can technically purchase credits, they rarely do so, in part because of the long duration of tax credits and rules that make it difficult for them to make full use of those credits to offset their tax liability. Perhaps more importantly, tax credit yields are low, since lending institutions have an incentive to pay high prices for tax credits as a way to boost their Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 grades. Other businesses are simply not willing or able to pay the same prices. In recent years, more than 80 percent of LIHTC purchases have been from banks (73 percent in 2016–18) and the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) (7 percent) (CohnReznick 2019). Strong demand from large financial institutions has meant more subsidy dollars for qualifying projects, but it has also led to a narrowing of the base of investors, leaving the credit vulnerable to fluctuations in demand from financial institutions. Furthermore, demand is regionally uneven, with areas without large banks concerned about their Community Reinvestment Act rating seeing far less demand and lower prices. Notably, demand has remained relatively stable during the current downturn, since financial institutions (at least to date) have not seen the same losses that they did during the Great Recession.\nCongress has taken some important steps to help ensure that the tax credit continues to be attractive during downturns. First, during the Great Recession, Congress launched the Tax Credit Exchange Program, which temporarily allowed state allocating agencies to swap unused or returned 9 percent tax credits for a grant from the federal government. The Tax Credit Exchange Program provided support to 911 LIHTC developments with more than 70,000 units during this period (Scally et al. 2018). State allocating agencies received $0.85 for every dollar of tax credit they exchanged, a price deemed to be fiscally neutral for the federal government. Because the program was designed to make up for the exit of the GSEs from the tax credit market, every allocating agency was allowed to swap up to 40 percent of their 2009 allocation, which was the average GSE market share at the time. Second, Congress established minimum tax credit rates for both the 9 percent tax credit (through the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008) and the 4 percent tax credit (through the recent COVID relief bill) rather than letting them float with interest rates and becoming less valuable as interest rates fall.\nWhile these actions have been helpful, LIHTC is still vulnerable to reductions in both credit supply and investor demand. Evidence suggests that the Tax Credit Exchange Program was helpful in keeping the production pipeline going during the Great Recession, but it was only temporary and required congressional action. There is no mechanism in place to allow such exchanges in the next downturn that hits the financial sector.\nFinally, another issue is the debt side of the multifamily market. Developers depend on mortgage loans to complete developments, but during downturns, lenders tend to tighten underwriting and cut back on lending, and investors withdraw from private label mortgage-backed securities. During the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the GSE share of the multifamily market rose to approximately 70 percent of debt, up from about 35 percent during the early 2000s. The increase in GSE share resulted largely from private sources pulling back, not because the GSEs invested more (Kaul 2015). The continued purchase of multifamily loans by the GSEs helped to keep some construction going.\nSince the housing crisis, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has established caps that limit the ability of GSEs to purchase multifamily loans and fill credit gaps when private lenders and investors withdraw. From 2015 through 2018, the annual caps were set at a flat $30 billion or $35 billion per GSE, which would have been binding but for an exception for green loans (i.e., loans that support energy and water efficiency improvements). The carve-outs for green loans permitted the GSEs to collectively purchase more than $140 billion worth of loans in 2018, well above their joint $70 billion official cap. The FHFA lifted each GSE’s cap to $100 billion for the five quarters starting in October of 2019 ($80 billion on an annualized basis), but it eliminated exceptions and mandated that more than a third of multifamily purchases be directed to affordable housing (Ackerman 2019). The FHFA recently lowered caps slightly to $70 billion per GSE for 2021 and required that half of the loans support affordable housing, which should drive more credit to LIHTC deals. While it is difficult to assess the degree to which the caps have restricted GSE purchases in practice, they clearly have the potential to do so, depending on the dollar amount. Significantly, changes in the caps do not move automatically with the market but instead depend on the discretion of the FHFA director.\nProposal: Bolstering the Housing Safety Net\nIn this section we propose a set of three policy reforms to make housing support more countercyclical. We propose (1) emergency rental assistance accounts that would provide renters with a buffer to help them manage both systemic and idiosyncratic shocks, (2) an automatic homeownership stabilization program for low- and moderate-income homeowners, and (3) an automatic tax credit exchange program that would allow allocating agencies to convert LIHTCs to direct subsidies when investor demand falls.\nIn order to maximize the countercyclicality of these automatic policy tools, we propose tying their activation to increases in local unemployment. Measures of metropolitan statistical area (MSA)–level unemployment are available for roughly 400 MSAs, and those residing outside of these MSAs could receive support based on nearest-MSA or state-level unemployment indices. Given that housing conditions vary greatly across regions, a one-size-fits-all approach based on a national trigger would, in our view, neglect many struggling communities even when aggregate metrics suggest that the economy is healthy.\nSpecifically, these programs could be tied to local unemployment using the threshold recommended by Sahm (2019). Using a three-month moving average of local unemployment rates, these policy tools would be activated when unemployment rises by 0.5 percentage points above the past 12-month minimum. Figure 6 shows the Sahm threshold rule for the United States from 2000 to 2021, with time periods where the unemployment changes (relative to the prior year’s minimum) exceed 0.5 percentage points as those where these programs would automatically spring to life. As Sahm (2019) shows, this threshold is an outstanding early indicator of subsequent macroeconomic contractions, predicting recessions in a fast, accurate, and transparent way.\nOur proposal takes the Sahm threshold rule trigger from the national to the local level. Figure 7 shows the share of MSAs (out of nearly 400 that the BLS estimates monthly unemployment rates for) that would be above the Sahm threshold in any given month from 2000 to 2020. While the COVID crisis and the Great Recession plunged all US MSAs into recession based on this indicator, a notable aspect of this figure is that around the dot-com recession of the early 2000s, some MSAs never reached the recession threshold. On the other hand, some MSAs’ local economies struggle even when the national economy is no longer officially in recession, with more than 30 percent of MSAs above the threshold in 2003–4. Since these stabilizers are inherently focused on local housing markets, we believe it makes sense to pair the policies with locally oriented thresholds for action. We discuss some of the trade-offs of a local calculation of the triggering event below. Nonetheless, our analysis here suggests that focusing on local variation will direct support to those who need it most.\nEmergency Rental Assistance Accounts\nAs described above, the current landscape of assistance options for low-income renters is largely inadequate to address either deteriorating macroeconomic conditions or idiosyncratic shocks that destabilize individual households. A more-reliable, more-responsive system of assistance to address the volatility in the financial circumstances of low-income renters is needed. To this end, we propose the creation of new emergency rental assistance accounts for individual tax units to address the broad range of negative shocks that can trigger acute housing instability such as eviction and resultant homelessness.\nThe accounts would be prepopulated by the US Treasury with a balance equal to four or five times the local Fair Market Rent at the time of account opening. The IRS would automatically create these accounts for any tax unit that is renting with an income less than 80 percent of the AMI. The size of the subsidized initial deposit would be determined by the size of the tax filing unit.\nThe emergency rental assistance account would be available to all renter households earning less than 80 percent of AMI.1 After an account is created for an eligible household, the household would continue to have access to the account as long as their annual income in any of the previous three tax years is below 80 percent of AMI. Unused funds in the account could be rolled into a down payment at any time if the household purchases a home.\nPayments from the account would be required to go toward housing, to ensure that households (at a minimum) remain stably housed, as well as to enhance political feasibility. The tenant would enter details for their landlord, such as name, address, and other details such as tax identification number, into an IRS website. The tenant would then control when payments are made, and the amount to be dispersed. When the tenant requests a payment through the IRS website, the IRS would then mail a check to the listed landlord.\nImportantly, households would not have to provide a reason for drawing from the account. This design feature would have a number of potential benefits. First, it would provide greater administrative simplicity. Second, it would ensure that vulnerable households can receive immediate assistance before their financial woes compound. Third, by not tying payments to a particular event, it would allow individuals to use assistance to address housing instability triggered by a wide variety of circumstances. To discourage tenants from aggressively drawing down the entirety of the account unrelated to an urgent need, the accounts would feature a saving incentive.\nLimiting the accounts to a finite amount of assistance reflects a recognition that this tool is not a replacement for housing programs designed to address the problem of persistently low incomes (such as housing vouchers, public housing, or project-based rental assistance). The accounts are intended to provide a flexible buffer for low-income renters to keep them housed through periods of temporary difficulties. Previous research suggests that evictions are typically preceded by short-term drops in income (Collinson et al. 2021). And the available research suggests that even short-term rental assistance can achieve persistent reductions in homelessness when administered to clients before they lose their housing (Evans, Sullivan, and Wallskog 2016). Using a fixed amount for the account also limits concerns that some might have of strategic rent nonpayment.\nIt is not entirely clear from existing research how large the account balances should be to address the most common shocks to low-income households. Many households facing eviction owe between two and three months of back rent (Collinson et al. 2021; Desmond et al. 2013). Piloting the intervention could be quite informative to determine details including the size of the accounts and the savings incentive. A significant concern with the proposed structure is that periods of prolonged economic downturn could lead many households to exhaust their accounts. To address this, the account balances could be replenished when the local Sahm threshold rule is triggered.\nThis raises the concern that households would strategically withdraw all funds in anticipation of replenishment during a local economic downturn, however. An alternative to replenishing the account with fully subsidized payments once it has been exhausted is to convert the account to a source of zero-interest loans for households to borrow against through future tax refunds. For example, after the household has withdrawn all funds from their account, they could borrow an amount up to an additional four times their Fair Market Rent to make emergency housing payments, with any amount that the household borrows from the account applied to their future tax liability in subsequent tax years.\nWe do not expect the accounts to have a major effect on the overall rental market. Conceivably, the accounts could increase demand for housing, which could push up rents in markets with inelastic housing supply. The size of the subsidy and the fact that the amount is finite, however, leads us to expect only a small effect on overall demand for rental housing. Federal rental assistance—such as housing vouchers—offers a much larger ongoing subsidy, and vouchers have little impact on overall rents (Eriksen and Ross 2015). The accounts could impact landlord behavior on other margins such as tenant screening. For example, some landlords might be more willing to rent to tenants with volatile income, but landlords might also request information on account balances from prospective tenants. It is possible that by reducing nonpayment risk that the accounts could conceivably lower rents—particularly on units likely to be rented by tenants at high risk of nonpayment—by lowering costs to the landlord.\nWhile this proposal is not feasible to stand up in response to the accumulated arrears from the COVID-19 economic crisis, creating a new structure to provide timely assistance to the housing insecure will ensure that the policy response to future crises is swifter and more effective.\nAutomatic Homeownership Stabilization Program\nSimilar to the purpose of the automatic program described above for renters, the primary goal of the automatic stabilizer program we propose for low- and moderate-income homeowners is to keep homeowners in their homes, reduce housing instability, and prevent negative spillovers from episodes of mass foreclosure. The program should be broad based, with eligibility for all mortgages for low- and moderate-income borrowers with household incomes below 100 percent of AMI in the pre-distress period (or at origination).2 The program should help households smooth negative shocks and minimize housing disruptions over the business cycle.\nRelative to landlord-tenant relationships, the long-term duration of mortgages presents both a challenge and an opportunity. On the one hand, substantial short-term adjustments need to be provided in a timely and universal manner by an industry that is typically relatively slower moving. On the other hand, the length of the mortgage obligation provides ample time for temporarily paused or reduced payments to be made up, either as higher monthly payments thereafter or a longer loan term needed to fully pay off the debt.\nThe design of an automatic homeownership stabilization program (AHSP) should build on lessons learned from the successes and limitations of HAMP during the Great Recession and COVID-related housing relief. The main successful elements have been rapid deployment of forbearance, avoiding servicer discretion and capacity issues, and adjusting the generosity and parameters of the programs as necessary. The primary limitations have been the lack of universality, the lack of standardization of guidelines for private modifications, the need for active participation on the part of servicers, and the need for active responses on the part of borrowers, creating a group of needlessly delinquent homeowners.\nIn order to capture these elements of success and address these prior weaknesses, we propose that all mortgages eligible for the AHSP automatically enter a three-month forbearance period in response to a triggering event of elevated local unemployment. This forbearance would be “opt out” rather than “opt in” from the borrower’s perspective and be as automatic as a change to payments that occurs when an adjustable-rate mortgage resets: the servicer could simply send a letter one month in advance telling the borrower that no payment is due the following month.\nPrior research has made clear that these stabilizers should be temporary to reflect temporary shocks, rather than to address the debt overhang of principal balances. Principal reductions have been shown to be far too costly and to deliver far less bang for the buck in terms of preventing default relative to reductions in monthly payments (Ganong and Noel 2020; Scharlemann and Shore 2016).\nA standardized automatic initial forbearance period would give borrowers and servicers much needed breathing room to assess subsequent need for continued forbearance, further modification, or additional support. If combined with a streamlined refinancing or modification program (along the lines proposed in Golding et al. 2021), servicers would have the time to determine what changes to the mortgage contract, if any, are appropriate. The three-month forbearance period would also provide all parties with time to collect information regarding the severity and permanence of the downturn, and would guide subsequent adjustments accordingly.\nThis AHSP has many proposed policy antecedents, in particular echoing and amplifying the recommendation of Piskorski and Seru (2018), who propose the indexation of mortgage payments to local economic conditions. Our proposal is an easily implemented simplification based on forbearance and local unemployment rates, but exploring more-sophisticated stabilizers that incorporate indexation would be worthwhile. Eberly and Krishnamurthy (2014) provide a relevant theoretical framework and discuss the trade-offs between reductions in mortgage payments and principal write-downs, supporting the deferment or reduction of mortgage payments in a recession. Guren, Krishnamurthy, and McQuade (2020) build a quantitative equilibrium lifecycle model to examine alternative mortgage designs, and find that contracts that automatically embed countercyclical payments dramatically outperform modification options that spread relief when liquidity constraints are less likely to be binding. Three months of forbearance at precisely the point when the constraints are likely to be most acute would greatly reduce homeowner distress.\nImportantly, Guren, Krishnamurthy, and McQuade (2020) find that the front-loading of relief to households sharply reduces the dynamic spiral between defaults and house prices. An extensive literature has documented substantial feedback effects from foreclosed properties on neighboring homes (e.g., Anenberg and Kung 2014; Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak 2011). Forestalling a tidal wave of foreclosures would benefit not only the neighborhoods where distress is frequently concentrated, but also any potential ripple effects faced by the broader financial system (Greenwald, Landvoigt, and Van Nieuwerburgh 2021). A thorough cost-benefit analysis would need to incorporate these dynamic effects to fully assess the value of automatic countercyclical support for the housing market.\nA natural concern for introducing an automatic forbearance rule into mortgage contracts is that this clause may affect the profitability of the contract for investors. Given the discussion above, the net social effect is likely positive since the temporary pause in payments for a large number of borrowers would be offset by the reduction in the severity of recessions and the probability of a wave of foreclosures that starts a downward spiral in house prices. In addition, this policy would finally remove the need for active behavior on the part of homeowners, who are often difficult for servicers to contact when they fall behind on payments. It is ambiguous what the overall financial consequences would be, but we expect that equilibrium mortgage rates would not increase very much once accounting for the total proposed benefits, and would recommend that these costs be borne by a broader pool of homeowners than just the low- and moderate-income borrowers who receive the benefits.\nA related concern with increased use of forbearance would be the burden faced by mortgage servicers, who generally have to forward payments to investors even if the borrower is in forbearance (Kim et al. 2018). During COVID, the Mortgage Bankers Association and a number of other trade groups have advocated for the creation of a federal liquidity facility to support mortgage servicers as they forward missed payments to investors. Since there is an increasing share of non-banks active in lending and servicing in the mortgage market, we believe a public-private liquidity facility, combining a line of government credit with a fund contributed to in good times by originators and servicers, would provide an additional level of stability in the mortgage finance system and allow servicers to be confident that they can continue to meet their full obligations to investors when briefly pausing borrowers’ payments in a downturn.\nGiven the potential benefits for a policy of this type, we recommend that a government agency, which already bears the bulk of the loans’ default risk, experiment with contract features such as introducing an automatic stabilizer program to newly originated or existing mortgages. Investors in government-backed securities are concerned only with prepayment risk and should not be particularly harmed by this program, since these stabilizers would presumably have much larger effects on default risk. The sizable government-backed mortgage market represents a largely untapped laboratory for experimentation. We encourage the agencies operating in this market to innovate on new ways to provide automatic temporary relief for distressed borrowers, and test the efficacy of these innovations through controlled experimental settings. During the pandemic, all federal student loans and federal disaster loans have been automatically placed into forbearance without needing action from borrowers; a system should be in place to do the same for federally backed mortgages.\nAutomatic Tax Credit Exchange Program\nAs noted above, our system of support for low-income housing production and renovation fails to expand as needs grow; indeed, both loans and subsidies available through the LIHTC may actually decline as credit tightens and investor demand dries up. We recommend two key reforms to boost—or at least sustain—construction and preservation of affordable housing during downturns.\nThe first recommendation is to make the LIHTC Exchange Program that was enacted through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) automatic and permanent. Specifically, this change to the tax credit would allow states and other allocating agencies to exchange up to half of their allocated 9 percent tax credits at a discounted, fiscally neutral price, up from 40 percent in the ARRA program. For example, the standing offer price might be 80 cents for a dollar of tax credits. States could exercise this option to exchange their allocated, unused tax credits at this price at any time, but they would have an incentive to do so only when the tax credit price falls below $0.80 as a result of reduced demand from investors.\nWe also recommend a few other extensions to the 2009 exchange program. First, we would open up the exchange option to 4 percent tax credits too. (See below for discussion on determining exchange volume.) Second, we encourage Congress to give states—at least states in high-vacancy, soft market regions—the flexibility to use the dollars that they receive from exchanging their tax credits for demand-side subsidies as well as for construction subsidies. Congress might restrict such rental assistance to households living in LIHTC developments to create a tighter nexus. Such rental subsidies would allow developers of LIHTC developments to serve more residents that earn less than 60 percent of the AMI. Demand-side subsidies would do less to keep construction going, but in many parts of the country the rental affordability problem is less about a lack of supply than it is about stagnant incomes.\nThe strengths of such an exchange program are clear. Most obviously, it would keep subsidies flowing to affordable housing, even when corporate investors have little, if any, taxable income to offset. In doing so, it would allow for the production and preservation of more affordable housing when investor demand falls and create jobs in the process. Although markets soften and rents can fall on average during recessions, rents at the low end of the market tend to remain stable, both because demand for lower-cost housing can rise and because owners are reluctant to reduce rents, given the need to cover operating and maintenance costs. Figure 1 shows that the share of cost-burdened renters tends to rise, not fall, during economic downturns. Furthermore, by keeping the production and preservation pipeline going (perhaps during periods when NIMBY opposition wanes), the program would also help to address the general shortage of housing in many markets.\nThe second strength of this proposal is that it would be fiscally neutral. More costs would fall on the appropriations side of the budget, but the tax credit exchange price could be set such that the impact on net tax revenues is neutral. Finally, making the program automatic would add certainty to the market and help to avert temporary disruptions.\nThese exchanges would mean that some developments would go forward only with public subsidy, losing the discipline of limited, private partners who have a strong incentive to monitor projects and ensure effective compliance. But we believe that the benefits outweigh these potential costs.\nOur second recommendation addresses the debt side of the market, since developers need both equity support and reasonably priced loans to produce housing at affordable rents. As noted above, lenders tend to tighten underwriting and cut back on lending during downturns, and investors withdraw from private-label mortgage-backed securities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can help to make up the shortfall, but they are bound by caps limiting their lending. While the FHFA director has the power to adjust caps as market conditions change, there is no guarantee that they will do so.\nThus, we propose to automatically raise caps on GSE purchases of affordable, multifamily loans during downturns when the rest of the commercial real estate industry cuts back on lending activity. Tying adjustments of those caps to increases in local unemployment rates would remove any political considerations and provide certainty to the market. Of course, our proposed automatic adjustment to the GSE multifamily lending caps will have a limited impact if regular caps are raised further and thus are no longer binding.\nFinally, both this proposal and the tax credit exchange program would disproportionately benefit households of color, a greater percentage of whom live in rental housing and affordable rental housing in particular. HUD (2018) estimated that 36 percent of LIHTC renters in 2015 were Black and 19.5 percent were Hispanic.\nQuestions and Concerns\nThere are naturally details to work out with all three of these sets of proposals, and each has potential risks. In this section, we provide a non-exhaustive discussion of issues around these programs’ designs and implementation challenges.\nWould the rental accounts be very expensive?\nThe initial creation of the accounts would require a large upfront outlay because the accounts are created for every eligible household before they might experience a need for assistance. According to the 2017 AHS, there were approximately 27 million renter households in the United States earning less than 80 percent of AMI. If we limit accounts to those not already receiving federal rental assistance, there are roughly 21 million households that would receive an account. We estimate that prepopulating the account with four times the relevant Fair Market Rent for these households would cost about $5,275 per household. Once the accounts have been created for all eligible households, ongoing costs arise from two sources: new household formation, and saving subsidies on account balances. New household formation is projected to add about 1.1 million households per year for the next decade (McCue 2018). Many of these households will be renters, and a large fraction will be eligible for an account.3\nWithout accounting for the additional costs of any savings incentives in the accounts, we estimate the 10-year cost of subsidizing the accounts would be $141 billion, or an annualized cost of $14.1 billion. Limiting eligibility more narrowly to households with incomes below 50 percent of AMI would produce a 10-year cost of $8.8 billion, or an annualized cost of just under $9 billion, which is comparable to the annual cost of LIHTC. While this expenditure is significant, the social costs associated with acute housing instability are also sizable—meaning the net cost of the intervention is likely to be much lower.\nIs four months of rent really enough?\nIt is challenging to anticipate the size of subsidy necessary to prevent acute housing instability for a substantial segment of low-income renters. While not all housing instability is captured by eviction court activity, it is instructive to consider the typical amount of arrears that landlords seek in eviction cases. Previous research finds that the typical tenant in housing court owes roughly two months in back rent, according to the landlord (Collinson et al. 2021; Desmond et al. 2013). Additionally, there is strong evidence that even one to two months of emergency rental assistance can be effective at preventing homelessness (Evans, Sullivan, and Wallskog 2016). Undoubtedly, some households will remain housing-unstable even with an emergency account, but the policy is not intended as a replacement for deeper federal rental assistance subsidies.\nWould households simply exhaust their accounts immediately to build cash savings?\nWe do not think this will be especially common for a few reasons. First, the accounts will feature a competitive rate of return on the unused funds, which encourages households to keep funds unspent unless they are faced with an urgent need. Next, there is compelling evidence that low-income households do not treat in-kind benefits as fungible with cash (Hastings and Shapiro 2018). Finally, since the payment must be initiated each month by the tenant, the program will have an implicit default of not making payments. Surely some households might arrange prepayment with their landlords and accrue cash savings from redirecting spending on rent.\nThese households would still be potentially accumulating savings, however, and those savings could be used to prevent future housing instability.\nWhat is the appropriate local trigger for replenishing the rental accounts and turning on the automatic forbearance for eligible homeowners?\nAbove, we proposed using the Sahm threshold rule when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points above the past 12-month minimum, as a potential trigger for local policies to activate or replenish. This threshold has been shown to be strongly predictive of subsequent distress at a macroeconomic level. Issues may arise when mapping a national rule like this one to a local context, however. First, local unemployment rates are inherently noisier than the national average. Thus, to reduce noise, it might make sense to use a different threshold size for the increase (say, 0.75 percentage points instead of 0.5 percentage points). Next, using a threshold related to the minimum of a series may additionally increase volatility of the programs’ activation. Using a more stable summary statistic, such as the Bolstering the Housing Safety Net: The Promise of Automatic Stabilizers 17 median or 25th percentile of the past 12 months, would lead to smoother transitions. Finally, MSA unemployment may not be reflective of neighborhood conditions, since some parts of the MSA could be in severe distress when the overall MSA unemployment rate remains high. Data limitations might preclude fine-tuning this threshold at a geographic level smaller than the MSA, but we encourage policymakers to explore whether there are sufficiently high-quality and high-frequency granular unemployment data that could be used for the purpose of automatically connecting local distress to local support.\nShould the homeowner forbearance program be triggered instead by a qualifying event?\nA natural first concern with the AHSP is how to design an appropriate trigger for the program. There is a trade-off between using individual outcomes, such as job loss or income shocks to initiate the forbearance period, and a trigger based on aggregate conditions, such as a rise in local unemployment. While the use of individual outcomes would more narrowly tailor the program to those who can demonstrate need, it also requires active outreach on the part of homeowners in distress who must know about the existence of the program, satisfy the eligibility requirements, and complete the verification and documentation to begin benefit receipt, leading to delays and gaps in take up. An automatic trigger based on the local unemployment rate would obviate the need for action on the part of homeowners to participate, and would be universal and immediate. We believe designing an automatic trigger that removes the decision-making on the part of both homeowners and servicers would greatly enhance the effectiveness of the forbearance period.\nWhich homeowners should be eligible for the AHSP?\nOne approach would be to require that all new mortgages (purchase or refinance) written to homeowners with household incomes below 100 percent of local AMI include this automatic forbearance option. This threshold would target those households most at risk of distress and foreclosure, namely the 10–15 percent of most at-risk homeowners. Alternatively, given the direct participation of the federal government in the single-family mortgage market, the FHA, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac could include the AHSP as part of any loan they originate. Given the FHA’s focus on first-time buyers (in FY 2020, more than 83 percent of all purchase loans were to first-time buyers), this would be a particularly suitable population to benefit from temporary forbearance, giving them time to explore and determine repayment solutions with their servicers.\nWould targeted payment assistance, in the style of the HHF, be preferable to automatic forbearance?\nWe believe that targeted payment assistance in conjunction with—rather than instead of—forbearance would be the most cost-effective way to address temporary repayment difficulties. Indeed, it is likely that a form of targeted assistance (potentially funded through the proposed Emergency Housing Protections and Relief Act of 2020) will support many homeowners once the national forbearance policies currently in place expire. Forbearance is much less expensive, and, when combined with a servicer liquidity facility, can provide a bridge for many households to a mortgage restructuring that still amortizes the full amount of principal and interest. For some households with extended repayment difficulties, payment assistance may help keep these borrowers in their homes. Regardless, at the expiration of both types of assistance, additional help should be provided to streamline mortgage modifications.\nWill a standing offer from the Treasury Department for tax credits crowd out private investors?\nWhile a LIHTC exchange program might potentially crowd out investors who would be willing to purchase credits, this will occur only if the federal government offers to pay a price equal or above the price that investors are willing to pay. To avoid crowd-out, the government can simply set a price that is below typical market levels. States will have an incentive to exchange credits only when investor demand dries up, and the market price falls below this level.\nHow much subsidy should states receive for four percent credits?\nUnlike the competitive 9 percent tax credits, rental developments automatically qualify for the 4 percent LIHTC as long as at least 40 percent of their units are rented at affordable rates to households earning less than 60 percent of the local AMI (or 20 percent are rented at affordable rates to families earning less than half the local AMI) and at least half of their financing comes from tax-exempt, private activity bonds.\nWithout a clear cap, it is less clear how Congress should decide how many 4 percent credits states should be allowed to exchange, but Congress could base the allowable amount on some percentage of the private activity bond volume caps each state faces, since those caps effectively constrain the use of 4 percent tax credits.\nShould states be allowed to convert unused tax credits to demand-side assistance?\nWe recommend that states be given flexibility to convert unused tax credits to demand-side assistance. A risk of affording such flexibility is that states in supply-constrained markets will convert credits to demand-side assistance when construction is warranted. One potential response would be to restrict the option of conversion to demand-side subsidies to soft markets. That said, we believe the risk of states over-converting to demand-side subsidies is low. Rather, we suspect that states will err on the side of using supply-side subsidies, given the strong support from politically powerful developers and home builders.\nWould raising GSE multifamily lending caps add risk to GSE portfolios?\nIncreasing the multifamily lending caps would add some risk to the GSE portfolio and might crowd out other investors, but we believe risks would be fairly minimal given the historically low default rates for GSE multifamily loans. Even in the wake of the Great Recession, serious delinquency rates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac multifamily loans peaked at 0.8 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively (Housing Finance Policy Center 2020). Congress could require that the majority of the loans GSEs support are for affordable housing, which tend to have even lower default rates than market-rate, multifamily loans.\nWhy not ask the FHA to fill gaps when the volume of private lending to multifamily housing shrinks?\nWhile the FHA has historically played an important role in stabilizing the multifamily market through providing credit when other lenders pull back, the GSEs have far greater capacity. In the wake of the Great Recession, the volume of FHA mortgages rose to $13 billion, as compared to a peak of $67 billion in 2007 for the GSEs (Golding Szymanoski, and Lee 2014; Kaul 2015).\nFHA multifamily loan requirements are more complicated and more restrictive than those for GSE products, and fewer lenders participate in the FHA multifamily market. Thus, raising GSE caps to address private multifamily gaps should encourage more multifamily lenders to continue to offer products during downturns.\nConclusion\nThe brutal inequality of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the value of automatic stabilizers that can help people manage income and financial shocks without losing their homes. When sheltering in place is the best way to protect against a raging virus, being without a home is clearly costly. Yet even without a spreading virus, housing instability is costly to individuals, to communities, and to broader society. Unfortunately, without congressional or regulatory action, our federal housing policies do little to protect against such instability.\nWe propose three sets of strategies to help make our housing policies and programs more countercyclical. We argue that these adjustments should be automatic, following simple, transparent rules that trigger support, such as when increases in national or local unemployment rates exceed some prespecified threshold. This automation would insulate these decisions from political debates and speed the rate at which money is delivered to struggling households. While each of our strategies has some risks, we believe that their benefits outweigh these potential costs.\nTo be clear, while we see these proposals as useful and even necessary to address volatility in housing needs, they would do little to address the long-term structural barriers to affordable housing in the United States. Even with these reforms put in place, too many low-income renters would still face unsustainable cost burdens, and restrictive land-use regulations would continue to exclude many homeowners and renters from the markets that offer the greatest opportunities for employment and upward mobility. Regulatory reform at the local level, expansions to the housing voucher program, and other investments in affordable housing would be needed to address these longer-term affordability challenges. But the relatively low-cost proposals we offer here would help to create new safeguards to address the next crisis more quickly.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Ford and the Shah of Iran confer over a map during the Shah's May 1975 visit to Washington, D.C. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger sits in the background. (Photo courtesy of Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library) |\nWashington, D.C., January 13, 2009 - During the 1970s the Shah of Iran argued, like current Iranian leaders today, for a nuclear energy capability on the basis of national \"rights,\" while the Ford and Carter administrations worried about nuclear weapons possibilities, according to newly declassified documents published today by the National Security Archive for the first time. Uranium enrichment capability is now the major point of controversy between Tehran and the world community, while during the 1970s Washington's greatest concern was that Iran sought a capability to produce plutonium, but in both instances the implication was that a nuclear weapons option might not be far away.\nThe documents, obtained by the Archive through a mandatory review request, show that two U.S. presidents dealing with the Shah of Iran, Ford and Carter, put concerns over proliferation and the Shah's possible desire to build a nuclear bomb front and center when they approved negotiating positions for a deal to sell nuclear reactors to Iran. While Iranian officials argued then, as they do today, that Iran had \"rights\" under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to develop nuclear technology, the U.S. government successfully sought an agreement that put nonproliferation controls over U.S.-supplied nuclear material.\nThe 1979 Iranian Revolution derailed the agreement, but the approach that the Ford and Carter administrations took shows significant continuity with contemporary U.S. and world policy, which holds that Iran must not use its technological capabilities to produce nuclear weapons. The documents contradict the 2005 claim by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that non-proliferation was not an issue in the 1970s negotiations; this was a \"commercial transaction,\" Kissinger told The Washington Post.\nThe 1970s nuclear negotiations have other parallels with the current situation. The Bush administration has raised questions about Iranian claims that its interest in a nuclear energy program are peaceful, while the declassified record indicates that U.S. policy-makers during the 1970s were also skeptical of, but ultimately willing to accept, the Shah's similar claims, as long as a nuclear agreement with Iran restricted its freedom of action in the nuclear field. Significantly, the Bush administration also disparages Iran's assertion that it needs to develop alternative fuels in anticipation of the eventual decline in the country's extensive oil reserves. But the Shah and his government made the exact same statements in the 1970s.\nThe record also shows that the Shah's regime and the current Iranian government have made the same claims that their pursuit of nuclear technology was an inherent national entitlement. No country \"has a right to dictate nuclear policy to another,\" said the Shah's chief atomic energy official in 1977.\nAmong the disclosures in the new documents:\nDrawing on the new documents, National Security Archive senior analyst William Burr has written an article to give perspective to the nuclear talks: \"A Brief History of U.S.-Iranian Nuclear Negotiations,\" now appearing on-line in the January-February 2009 issue of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. While the documents available so far illuminate the negotiations, more needs to be learned from U.S. government files. To a great extent the intelligence side of the story remains an unknown. So far, the Central Intelligence Agency has denied all documents gleaned from the Archive's mandatory review request, although they are presently under appeal.\nThe Iranian Nuclear Program, 1974-1978\nEdited by William Burr\n| Next to a statement by the Shah disavowing an interest in reprocessing plutonium, a staffer at the Pentagon's Office of International Security Affairs drew a little picture of a bull to express his skepticism. (See Document 30) |\nTo provide some historical background on the current controversy over the Iranian nuclear program, National Security Archive senior analyst William Burr has written an article, \"A Brief History of U.S.-Iranian Nuclear Negotiations,\" now appearing in the January-February 2009 issue of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The Iranian nuclear controversy makes it worth looking at the years before the 1979 revolution, when the Shah of Iran was setting his sights on major nuclear power investments. Seeking a huge electrical power generating capability, Shah Mohammad Rez Pahlavi negotiated nuclear reactor deals with France and West Germany and wanted to buy eight reactors from the United States. This nuclear power initiative overlapped with Washington's growing concern over nuclear proliferation triggered by India's \"peaceful nuclear explosion\" in May 1974. While the Shah had publicly disavowed a nuclear weapons capability, the Iranians declared that they had the \"right\" to a full nuclear fuel cycle, including reprocessing of spent fuel. Not sure about the Shah's ultimate purposes, neither the Ford nor the Carter administrations would sell reactors without strings attacked.\nWashington policymakers tried to use the nuclear negotiations as leverage to minimize the extent to which Iran could develop any of the critical elements of a nuclear weapons capability. The Carter administration would go further than its predecessor in attempting to reduce Iran's freedom of action, but both Presidents insisted on the tightest controls possible over Iran's ability to use U.S.-supplied nuclear technology and fuel for producing plutonium. While the Iranians made nationalist arguments asserting their \"rights\" to reprocessing and other activities under the NPT, by the summer of 1978, the two sides had reached an agreement, which the Iranian revolution effectively nullified.\nInterestingly, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who presided over the negotiations during 1974-1976, has downplayed the role of proliferation during the nuclear negotiations with Iran. In a 2005 Washington Post interview, he said that \"I don't think the issue of proliferation came up\"; \"They were an allied country, and this was a commercial transaction. We didn't address the question of them one day moving toward nuclear weapons.\" (Note 1) Certainly no one saw an Iranian nuclear weapons capability as a likely near-term possibility, but Kissinger and the State Department never treated the agreement as simply a \"commercial\" proposition. First, Ford administration officials wondered whether the Shah of Iran would move toward a nuclear weapons option, should the regional balance of power change. Second, Kissinger and his senior advisers would only sign off an agreement that constrained Iran's capability to use U.S.-supplied resources for producing nuclear weapons material. This was no less true of the Carter administration; both Ford and Carter wanted to ensure that the terms of the agreement met U.S. nuclear nonproliferation goals. (Note 2)\nWhat made the The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists article possible is the ongoing declassification of documentation on the nuclear negotiation from the Ford and Carter administrations--State Department and Tehran embassy cables, Defense Department papers, and White House and National Security Council memoranda and studies—that provide significant insight into the positions that Washington and Tehran took on the nuclear deal. All of the documents cited in the footnotes of the article, as well as a few more items, are reproduced in this briefing book (see below). As rich as the documentation is, however, more needs to be learned from U.S. government files, including materials at the Ford and Carter presidential library. For example, to a great extent the intelligence side of the story remains an unknown. So far, the Central Intelligence Agency has denied all documents gleaned from a mandatory review request to the Department of Defense, although they are current under appeal.\nRead the Documents\nDocuments 1a-d: The Shah's Statements on Nuclear Weapons: \"Without Any Doubt\"\n1a: U.S. Embassy Paris cable 15305 to Department of State, \"Interview with Shah,\" 24 June 1974, Unclassified\n1b: U.S. Embassy Paris cable 15445 to Department of State, \"Further Remarks by Shah on Nuclear Weapons,\" 25 June 1974, Unclassified\n1c: U.S. Embassy Tehran cable 5192 to Department of State, \"Shah's Alleged Statement on Nuclear Weapons,\" 25 June 1974, Confidential\n1d: U.S. Embassy Tehran cable 5389 to Department of State, \"Iran's Intentions in Nuclear Matters,\" 1 July 1974, Confidential\nSources: Mandatory review (MR) request to Department of Defense and Access to Archival Documentation (AAD), National Archives and Records Administration\nNot long after the Indian \"peaceful nuclear explosion,\" the Shah of Iran caused a flap when asked by a journalist whether Iran would have nuclear weapons: \"without any doubt, and sooner than one would think.\" Iranian officials quickly denied that the Shah had said any such thing; instead, \"HIM (His Imperial Majesty) actually said Iran is not thinking of building nuclear weapons but may revise its policy … if other non-nuclear nations do.\" In another statement, this one to Le Monde, the Shah ridiculed the nuclear arms race, but observed that if other nations in the region acquired nuclear weapons, \"then perhaps the national interests of any country at all would demand the same.\" Ambassador (and former CIA chief) Richard Helms was satisfied with the corrections offered by the Shah and his advisers. In a cable to the Acting Secretary of State, Helms wrote that \"I want to emphasize to you personally that there has been no change in Iran's declared policy not to acquire nuclear weapons.\"\nLater in 1974, CIA analysts suggested that under some circumstances, Iran's declaratory policy could change. In light of the Shah's \"ambition to make Iran a power to be reckoned with,\" if he \"is alive in the 1980s, if Iran has a full-pledged nuclear power industry and all the facilities necessary to make nuclear weapons, and if other countries have proceeded with nuclear weapons development, we have no doubt that Iran will follow suit.\" (Note 3)\nDocument 2: Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs to Secretary of Defense, \"Nuclear Energy Cooperation with Iran (U) – Action Memorandum,\" n.d. [Late June 1974], enclosing Atomic Energy Commission and Department of State memoranda, Confidential, with handwritten note attached\nSource: Mandatory Review\nThese memoranda provide a sense of the concerns that shaped the U.S. position throughout the nuclear negotiations with Iran. Not only did Defense Department officials observe that the nuclear power plants sought by the Shah would provide a capability to produce hundreds of nuclear weapons, Department of State officials worried that should the Shah's dictatorship collapse and Iran became unstable, \"domestic dissidents or foreign terrorists might easily be able to seize any special nuclear material stored in Iran for use in bombs.\" Moreover, \"an aggressive successor to the Shah might consider nuclear weapons the final item needed to establish Iran's complete military dominance of the region.\" It was those concerns that made the Ford administration seek special controls to ensure that U.S.-supplied nuclear materials in Iran were safeguarded for peaceful uses only.\nThe agencies raised legitimate issues, but the Ford administration had ample incentive to make nuclear sales to Iran. When the nuclear deal was first proposed the United States was heading toward a deep recession, so reactor sales would be a plus. Moreover, just like the Nixon administration, the Ford White House saw the Shah and Iran as a critically important ally in the volatile Middle East, and not only as a source of oil, but as a major proxy in support of U.S. interests in the region. Despite the notoriety of the Shah's police state, the importance that Ford and Kissinger attached to a stable Iran made them willing to conciliate the Shah by keeping their eyes blind to the human rights abuses associated with the dictatorship. For his part, the Shah sought close relations with Washington to strengthen his domestic position as well as to counter the Soviet Union, such rivals as Iraq, and radical forces in the region generally. No puppet, the Shah was relatively impervious to U.S. importuning against oil price increases, although he recycled billions of petrodollars in arms purchases from the United States. Indeed, the White House maintained a \"green light\" for arms sales to improve the balance of payments. In light of the varied interests at stake, U.S. senior officials worked hard at cementing the relationship, to the point where Vice President Nelson Rockefeller compared \"His Imperial Majesty\" to Alexander the Great. (Note 4)\nDocument 3: \"The Proliferation Problem is at a Crucial Juncture\"\nNSC Under Secretaries Committee to Deputy Secretary of Defense et al, \"US Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy,\" 4 December 1974, enclosing Memorandum for the President from Robert S. Ingersoll, Chairman, 4 December 1974, and NSSM 202 Study, \"Executive Summary,\" Secret\nSource: National Archives, CIA Research Tool (CREST)\nOther priorities, including an ongoing interagency nuclear proliferation policy review, put the Iranian nuclear deal on the backburner. The policy review completed in early December 1974 recommended an \"intensified program to inhibit the further spread of independent nuclear explosives capabilities.\" Worried that inhibitions to nuclear proliferation and security guarantees were weakening, the NSC Under Secretaries recognized that it might be possible only to delay proliferation, but that even a \"partially effective strategy\" could serve U.S. national security policy. Any action taken, however, had to be cooperative because the United States was beginning to lose its dominant position as a nuclear exporter.\nTo meet non-proliferation goals, the report called for 1) concerted action by nuclear industrial states to tighten controls on nuclear exports, especially to \"sensitive regions\" (e.g., Middle East), 2) intensified efforts to support the NPT and to secure treaty ratification by Japan and EEC countries, among others, 3) multilateral efforts to discourage further proliferation in South Asia (e.g., discourage further Indian tests and encourage India to place IAEA safeguards on nuclear exports), and 4) a U.S. interagency mechanism to \"formulate and oversee future U.S. nonproliferation policies.\"\nOne of the key proposals in the report was for a conference of nuclear exporters; this was the germ of the idea of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which has played a key role since the mid-1970s in decisions on exports of sensitive technology. Another cooperative approach was to consider the possibility of \"regional multinational plants …offering favorable terms for reprocessing services to smaller countries,\" thus avoiding independent national reprocessing capabilities. Some of the ideas in the report, for example on \"peaceful nuclear explosive\" (PNEs), represented a compromise. While emphasizing the need to prevent non-nuclear states from developing PNEs, which was the same as a weapons capability, some language in the report suggested that Washington should support Article V of the NPT encouraging the accessibility of \"potential benefits of peaceful applications of nuclear explosions\" to signatory states so that Moscow did not get an advantage in that area.\nDocument 4: \"Minimize Proliferation Risks\"\nExecutive Secretary Samuel R.

Department of State Records. Executive Secretariat Records. Memorandums of the Executive Secretariat, 1964-1975, box 11, S/S memos - December 74\nAmong his other ambitions, the Shah of Iran wanted a \"full-pledged nuclear power industry\" to power new industries when petroleum resources began to decline. Toward that end, the Shah negotiated the purchase of reactors and other technology with a number of nuclear exporters: France, West Germany, and the United States. The Ford administration also encouraged the Bechtel Corporation to propose to the Shah an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in a U.S.-based uranium enrichment plant. On the U.S. side, the Nixon, and then the Ford, administration, wanted to initial a nuclear cooperation agreement that would set the policy conditions for the sale of eight rectors to Iran; it could not be simply a commercial sale. Necessarily, the Indian PNE was part of the backdrop for the negotiation and Congressional concern about nuclear proliferation had grown exponentially, especially because New Delhi had used a Canadian-supplied reactor as its source of plutonium. These conflicting pressures led senior State Department officials to recommend a position that was not so \"strong\" that it would encourage the Shah to buy elsewhere, but not so \"weak\" that Congress would reject it. Secretary of State Kissinger accepted the recommendation for option three, giving Washington \"veto rights\" so that it could insist either on \"external processing and storage\" of spent fuel or set standards \"for internal disposition and possible construction of a multilateral reprocessing plant.\" Nevertheless, plainly irritated that his subordinates had already told Congress that the agreement would \"include additional bilateral provisions that go beyond IAEA requirements,\" Kissinger wanted them to explain why they had limited his freedom of action.\nDocuments 5a-d: National Security Study and Decision Memoranda: Balancing Proliferation Concerns and Export Interests\n5a: \"Report of the NSSM 219 Working Group [,] Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with Iran,\" [April 1975], Secret\n5b: U.S. Embassy Tehran cable 3437 to Department of State, \"Draft Agreement on Atomic Energy,\"15 April 1975, Secret\n5c: Deputy Secretary of State Robert Ingersoll to Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs [Kissinger], \"Department of State Response to NSSM 219 (Nuclear Cooperation with Iran),\" 18 April 1975, Secret\n5d: National Security Decision Memorandum 292, \"U.S.-Iran Nuclear Cooperation,\" 22 April 1975, signed by Henry Kissinger, Secret\n5e: Secretary of Defense James R.

Bush, Jeffrey Richelson, editor. (Except B which is AAD)\nWhile Kissinger already had signed off on a policy position, the Iranian deal had to go through a major review so that it would have the support of all of the relevant agencies. During the early spring of 1975, before the Shah's scheduled visit to the United States in May, the agencies considered possible approaches to the reactor sale, trying to secure an optimal balance between proliferation \"principles and objectives\" and such goals as export business and good relations with the Shah. After reviewing a number of options, ranging from a veto over reprocessing to allowing Iran to \"perform reprocessing\" with adequate safeguards, the White House issued a National Security Decision Memorandum, signed by Henry Kissinger on 22 April 1975. While Kissinger took a flexible position on fuel supply issues, the initial negotiating position on reprocessing would be hard: \"Continue to require U.S. approval for reprocessing of U.S. supplied fuel,\" with the establishment of a multinational reprocessing facility an \"important factor\" for securing such approval. For a fallback position, the U.S. would approve reprocessing in Iran so long as the supplier of technology and equipment was a \"full and active participation in the plant,\" with the possibility of U.S. participation to be held \"open.\" As long as the U.S. was able to ensure additional safeguards, the possibility of a binational option was generally consistent with Richard Helms' advice that Washington work for a tacit veto by acquiring \"a voice in management decisions\" in a reprocessing plant.\nDocument 6: Department of State Briefing Paper, \"Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation,\" May 1975, Confidential\nSource: National Archives, Record Group 59, State Department Briefing Books, box 215, State Visit of the Shah of Iran May 15-18, 1975\nRecords of the late April 1975 nuclear talks in Tehran are not yet available, but apparently the Shah's representatives wanted more give on reprocessing: If they made a \"strenuous\" effort to get a supplier involved in a reprocessing plant, but it did not work out, they should not be penalized. U.S. negotiators, however, insisted that the Iranians get suppliers involved: \"the added assurances against [proliferation] which accompany supplier involvement depend on its actually being achieved.\" The Ford administration had to take into account Congressional concerns, which strongly opposed concessions that could weaken non-proliferation and the White House could not even be sure that its fallback would satisfy the Hill. The nuclear issue did not come up during the Shah's May visit and the negotiations would continue.\nDocument 7: The Shah's Motives Are \"Not Entirely Clear\"\nTehran Embassy cable 5939 to State Department, \"Multinational Nuclear Centers: Assessment of Iranian Attitudes toward Plutonium Reprocessing,\" 17 July 1975, Secret\nSource: AAD\nDeputy chief of mission (DCM) Jack Miklos explored the Shah's interest in nuclear power and why Iranian officials objected to the U.S. proposal for a multinational reprocessing facility. He did not rule out the possibility that the \"interest in acquiring nuclear know-how and plutonium is, in part, motivated by the desire to preserve [the nuclear option] should the region's balance of power shift toward the nuclear [states].\" Whatever the Shah's intentions were, Miklos argued that Iran wanted to develop uranium enrichment capabilities and to \"possess [its] own fuel reprocessing facility.\" In light of those objectives, it was possible that the Iranian's opposed proposals for a multinational reprocessing facility because of an \"unwillingness to submit their plant to foreign surveillance.\"\nDocument 8: Lewis A.

Dunn was an analyst at Herman Kahn's Hudson Institute, where he worked on nuclear proliferation issues. A major contract study, written with Kahn, for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, developed a \"proliferation chain\" argument, suggesting that the Indian PNE had unleashed a chain reaction that could lead to significantly widespread proliferation. (Note 5) Some talking points from Dunn's briefing at the Pentagon in July 1975 outlined the considerations that might influence an Iranian decision during the 1980s to develop a weapons capability as well as the various shapes that such a capability could take. A chart prepared for the briefing exemplified the proliferation chain approach by showing possible time-lines for national nuclear decisions influenced by the Indian PNE. The \"chain\" for Iran could be either a straight line from India or the influence of earlier decisions by Israel to develop an overt capability, by Egypt to announce an intent, and by Libya to develop a bomb in the \"basement.\"\nDocuments 9a-c: \"Incompatible with our Sovereignty\"\n9a: State Department cable 254826 to Embassy Tehran, \"Nuclear Agreement for Cooperation,\" 25 October 1975, Secret\n9b: Tehran Embassy cable 11089 to State Department, \"Shah's Interview by Business Week Given Prominent Coverage by English Language Kayhan,\" 13 November 1975, Confidential\n9c: Tehran Embassy cable 11539 to State Department, \"US/Iran Nuclear Agreement,\" 26 November 1975, Secret\nSources: A and B: AAD; C: Mandatory review request\nDiscussions at Vienna disclosed serious disagreements over the nuclear cooperation agreement, with Iranian atomic energy chief Etemad rejecting Washington's insistence that, through the multinational plant, it participate in decisions on reprocessing of U.S.-supplied spent fuel. Kissinger was not ready to back down from this position; a telegram that he approved asked Ambassador Richard Helms to explain U.S. motives to the Shah and to make the point that \"we are not in any way singling out Iran for special, disadvantageous treatment\"; the issues at stake were not technical ones but \"directly related to security and stability in the region.\" But Helms was worried \"how serious a problem the nuclear deadlock has become,\" especially after the Shah observed, in an interview, that the U.S. position conflicted with Iran's \"sovereignty\" and that Washington was asking for things \"that the French or Germans would never dream of doing.\" Given the Shah's frame of mind, Helms concluded that the proposal for a regional reprocessing facility could not be sold and that if Iran insisted on a reprocessing plant it should be under joint U.S.-Iran control with \"stringent safeguards.\nDocument 10: \"Focused Solely on Energy\"\nU.S. Embassy Tehran Cable 73 to State Department, \"Iranian Nuclear Policy,\" 6 January 1976, Confidential\nSource: Mandatory review request\nWhile the negotiations were in abeyance, Dr. Ahmad Etemad, the Chairman of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization traveled to India where he reportedly discussed Iran's nuclear program and mentioned his interest in \"peaceful nuclear explosions\" (PNEs). Meeting with DCM Jack Miklos, who was seeking clarification of the press coverage, Etemad confirmed that he was indeed interested in PNEs, but that Iran would seek them only in the context of an \"international agreement that nuclear explosions might be found economically useful and feasible to move mountains, dig canals, etc.\" To underline the point, he confirmed that Iran was not interested in building reprocessing facilities, which were necessary to develop PNEs. Assuring Miklos of Iran's commitment to the NPT, even a stronger version with more safeguards, Etemad stated that Iran sought nuclear power for economic reasons only. Nevertheless, Iran would not accept \"safeguard terms or conditions that go beyond its present commitments if they are dictated by nuclear-have nations.\" To dispel notions that the impasse on the nuclear cooperation agreement reflected larger problems in the U.S.-Iran relationship, Etemad suggested he visit Washington for technical discussions.\nDocument 11: \"To Set a World Example\"\nNational Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to President Ford, \"Letter to the Shah,\" n.d.

Ford Library, NSC Institutional Files, Box 64, NSSM 324, Nuclear Agreement with Iran\nReporting on the Seamans conversations with the Shah and the Shah's recent letter to President Ford, National Security Adviser Scowcroft observed that the sticking point was that the monarch remained \"unwilling to commit to … a joint [reprocessing] venture as the sine qua non for our approval of the reprocessing of U.S.-supplied fuel in Iran.\" Worried that the lack of a nuclear agreement \"represents a serious irritant in our relations with Iran, Scowcroft argued that it was pointless to press for the multinational option. Instead, he suggested that president Ford approve a second option, involving \"buy-back\" of spent fuel. If the Iranians rejected \"buy-back\", then the United States could, as a fall back, insist on bilateral measures that supplemented the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Authority. Ford approved that recommendation.\nDocument 17: \"[We Should] Not Fall on Our Own Swords to Push Others into Multinational Projects\"\nMemorandum of Conversation, \"Proposed Cable to Tehran on Pakistani Nuclear Processing,\" 12 May 1976, Secret/Nodis\nBesides negotiating an agreement with Iran that he could live with, Kissinger also faced dilemmas created by Pakistan's nuclear program and the German nuclear sale to Iran, which also raised concerns about reprocessing. While Kissinger believed it important to oppose national reprocessing, as the quote about \"falling on our own swords\" appears to suggest, he was doubtful about the viability of the multinational concept.\nDocuments 18a-b: Draft Nuclear Agreement\n18a: State Department cable 132760 to Embassy Tehran, \"Iranian Nuclear Power Agreement,\" 28 May 1976, Confidential\n18b: State Department cable 135220 to Embassy Tehran, \"Nuclear Power Agreement with Iran,\" 2 June 1976, Confidential\nSource: MDR request\nEven if Kissinger was getting sour over the concept of multinational processing, it had gone too far in the negotiations with Iran to be abandoned. During talks with Iran's atomic energy chief Etemad in April, the two sides appeared to converge on the basic principles of an agreement, including the new U.S. \"buy-back\" concept. Based on the talks with Etemad, on 28 May, ERDA and the State Department sent the Embassy a draft agreement and, a few days later, talking points to be used in discussions with the Iranians. Designed to serve as a model for future nuclear agreements with other countries, the text included complex requirements to ensure that the nuclear materials and technology were used only for purposes that were consistent with non-proliferation goals.\nThe key provisions concerned reprocessing and safeguards. In keeping with earlier discussion of the principle of \"consent,\" the draft stipulated that any reprocessing of Iran's spent fuel must be \"performed in facilities acceptable to the parties.\" But even before reprocessing could be a possibility, the U.S. proposed buying back spent fuel, with payment in money or in the equivalent value of reactor fuel. Alternatively, Iran could transfer spent fuel to another country or group of nations, as long as it was used for peaceful purposes under mutually acceptable safeguards. In addition to the safeguards imposed by the IAEA to prevent diversion into military applications, the U.S. draft spelled out additional arrangements to safeguard nonproliferation interests. For example, the United States would have right to review \"design of any reactor\" or other equipment and devices \"determined to be relevant to the effective application of safeguards.\" Moreover, the designated U.S. personnel would have \"access in Iran to all places and data necessary to account for … special nuclear material.\"\nBesides the agreement, the U.S. included a note designed to reflect \"special\" aspects of the U.S.-Iran relationship. If the U.S. did not exercise the buy-back option and Iran chose to establish reprocessing facilities, Tehran would be required to \"achieve the fullest possible participation in the management and operation of such facilities of the nation or nations which serve as suppliers of technology and major equipment.\" Moreover, Iran would invite the United States to \"participate fully and actively in [the] management and operation\" of the facilities. Nevertheless, if Iran's \"strenuous\" efforts to secure multinational participation failed for \"reasons beyond [its] control,\" and, again, Washington had not exercised the buy-back option, Iran could develop reprocessing facilities \"acceptable to the parties\" and following the rigorous safeguards spelled out in articles XI and XII of the agreement. While Etemad wanted the agreement to include the provisions of the note, U.S. negotiators did not want to change the procedure because they expected that agreements with other countries would include notes to reflect the circumstances of the negotiations.\nDocuments 19a-b: \"Proliferation is Anathema to Iran\"\n19a: U.S. Embassy Tehran cable 5735 to State Department, \"Iranian Nuclear Power Agreement,\" 7 June 1976, Confidential\n19b: U.S. Embassy Tehran cable 5765 to State Department, \"Iranian Views on Non-Proliferation and US/Iran Nuclear Cooperation,\" 7 June 1976, Secret\nSource: MDR release\nOn 6 June 1976, Ambassador Richard Helms and science attaché Albert Chapman presented atomic energy chief Etemad with the draft agreement and note. Once Tehran had digested the U.S. proposals, ERDA and the State Department could send a team for detailed negotiations. Helms stated that he supported Etemad's earlier proposal for a \"high-level exchange,\" once the agreement was finalized, during which the two parties could reaffirm non-proliferation commitments and \"announce our intentions to explore diligently the binational/multinational fuel reprocessing concept.\" Comments by Etemad suggested that the Shah was not interested in the high-level exchange, but he emphasized Iran's support for the NPT's goals, noting that \"proliferation can only weaken Iran's position vis-à-vis its neighbors, and therefore proliferation is anathema to Iran.\" He was especially concerned about Indian pressure on Pakistan and suggested that Washington provide a \"guarantee against nuclear attack by India,\" implying that such action would reduce pressure on Pakistan to go nuclear.\nDocument 20: The Iran-West German Agreement\nMemorandum of Conversation, \"The Secretary's Meeting with FRG Ambassador Von Staden on the FRG/Iran Agreement for Nuclear Cooperation,\" 2 July 1976, Secret/Nodis\nSource: Digital National Security Archive\nThe Iran-West German nuclear negotiations mentioned earlier (and related talks with Brazil) were a source of heartburn for Kissinger and the State Department because they believed that Bonn did not take a tough enough position on reprocessing. As Kissinger reminded Ambassador Von Staden, \"we had strongly urged that the FRG not transfer reprocessing to Iran.\" While Von Staden argued that the agreement included a number of safeguards designed to limit Iran's freedom of action, he conceded that the agreement did not prevent reprocessing in Iran. This prompted Kissinger to observe that \"This agreement is not greeted with enthusiasm by the US … [W]e cannot avoid saying that we did not approve of this agreement.\"\nDocument 21: \"Iran Shall Have Full Right to Decide\"\nU.S. Embassy Tehran cable 7485 to State Department, \"Iranian Counterproposals for Atomic Energy Agreement,\" 23 July 1976, Confidential\nSource: MR request\nOn 22 July, Etemad gave Helms his government's response to the U.S. draft agreement. Embassy officials later characterized Tehran's paper as \"extreme\", probably because it rejected the U.S. veto of Iranian reprocessing of the spent fuel supplied by the United States. The Government of Iran \"seriously intended to have [reprocessing] performed in facilities established in Iran\" and in \"all fairness [Washington should] be prepared to supply Iran with the means to establish all facilities which … constitute integral part of [Iran's] nuclear power program.\" So that Iran could control the entire nuclear fuel cycle, it should \"have the right to effective control of the management and operation of the reprocessing facilities.\" U.S. participation would be appreciated, but Washington would have only minority voting rights\" and no veto. \"Iran should have full right to decide whether to reprocess or otherwise dispose or treat the materials provided under the agreement.\" Nevertheless, the U.S. buy-back option remained on the table; if Iran did not want to reprocess the United States could either provide financial compensation or enriched uranium \"equivalent in energy value to the recoverable special nuclear material\" contained in the spent fuel.\nDocument 22: \"How We Gave the Farm Away\"?\nTehran Embassy cable 7886 to State Department, \"Nuclear Energy Discussions,\" August 3, 1976, Confidential, with annotations and cartoon by Pentagon official\nSource: Mandatory Review\nIn early August 1976, Henry Kissinger and other U.S. officials traveled to Iran for meetings of a joint U.S.-Iran Economic Commission for talks on the nuclear agreement, among other issues. Etemad held on to his position about a U.S. \"obligation to assist Iran in all areas of nuclear technology\" and his view that Iran would not \"accept discriminatory treatment.\" Nonetheless, he acknowledged that Washington was in no position to assist with reprocessing and conceded that the key issue for Iran was an \"assured fuel supply.\" U.S. officials could not make assurances about anything, but they explained that they wanted the agreement to reflect \"U.S. intent to perform,\" within \"necessary practical and legal limits.\" \"They also stressed that bottom line of U.S. May 31 draft enables reprocessing in Iranian national facilities, thus ensuring that Iran is not foreclosed from every solution to reprocessing problem.\" In the ensuing discussion, the Iranians showed readiness to consider the alternatives to the \"bottom line,\" e.g., the buy-back (\"fuel exchange\") or third-country reprocessing.\nWhile Ambassador Helms saw a \"promising basis for continuing discussion,\" a skeptical official at the Iran desk of the Pentagon's Office of International Security Affairs (ISA) was far from satisfied. Probably worried that the \"bottom line\" position enabling Iranian reprocessing under some circumstances was a danger (and unaware of Kissinger's position on buy-back), the official believed that Washington was giving the \"farm away\" and drew an amusing cartoon of the Shah standing in front of a prostrate Uncle Sam, with the latter saying \"Oh – please walk all over me.\"\nDocuments 23a-b: \"We'll Insist on Reprocessing in [the] US\"\n23a.

Robinson, \"Nuclear Negotiations with Iran,\" 18 August 1976, Secret/Nodis\nSource: RG 59, Records of Deputy Secretary of State Charles W. Robinson, Box 6, CWR- Memos to the Secretary, July 1976- Sept 1976\nBesides meeting with the Joint Economic Commission, Kissinger had meetings with the Shah to discuss the nuclear deal. Records of Kissinger's discussions with the Shah are not yet available, but State Department memos include some significant details on the negotiations. Apparently, Kissinger explained to the Shah that a \"purely national\" Iranian reprocessing plant would not be acceptable. The nuclear cooperation agreement would provide alternatives to national reprocessing--\"buy-back,\" binational reprocessing, and reprocessing in a third country (e.g., in Western Europe)--but the U.S., as Kissinger saw it, would consistently exercise the buy-back option. Thus, while Iran would have a theoretical right to reprocess U.S.-provided spent fuel as a \"last resort,\" it would never exercise it.\nFrom Tehran's perspective, one problem in the buy-back option was the possibility of \"commercial risks\" for Iran. If, at some point, the commercial value of enriched uranium and plutonium increased, the spent fuel rods would be worth more and the Iranians would have made money if they had held on to them. Under proposed new terms of the agreement, the U.S. would compensate Iran for \"any loss it has suffered as a result of our reprocessing of the spent rods.\" Deputy Secretary Robinson told Kissinger that he \"didn't believe that there would be any great financial burden to the U.S. in assuming the 'commercial risks.'\"\nA more significant complication was the extent to which Washington could provide \"ironclad assurances\" to Iran that it would be a reliable supplier of nuclear fuel under the agreement. For example, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would have to review each nuclear shipment to Iran separately; it had authority to block any nuclear export that it deemed inconsistent with U.S. security interests. While the Ford administration could explore the possibility of changing NRC procedures so that it could provide a blanket license to cover export commitments to Iran, the \"policy and institutional issues appear so profound\" that it would require major changes in nuclear export procedures to implement the agreement with Iran.\nWith the 1976 presidential campaign under way, the U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations came to a halt, although serious conflict with the Shah over petroleum prices, which exacerbated in November, probably contributed to the standstill. Nevertheless, an important policy development occurred during the final days of the campaign, when President Ford belatedly responded to Jimmy Carter's criticisms, as well as public concern generally, by issuing a major statement on nuclear proliferation policy. Consistent with the approach that the administration had been taking toward the negotiations with Iran, Ford took a highly restrictive stand on reprocessing: It \"should not proceed unless there is sound reason to believe that the world community can effectively overcome the associated risks of proliferation.\" To support that judgment Ford called for changes in domestic nuclear policies, cooperation between nuclear exporters on behalf of \"'maximum restraint in the transfer of reprocessing and enrichment technology,\" and international cooperation to ensure that \"customer nations have an adequate supply of fuel for their nuclear power plants,\" among other measures. (Note 6)\nDocument 24: \"We Should Move Heaven and Earth\"\nMemorandum of conversation, \"Secretary's Meeting with the General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament,\" 6 January [1977], Secret\nSource: Digital National Security Archive\nAs secretary of state, Kissinger held periodic meetings with the General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament (GAC), which was the statutorily-mandated advisory body to the late lamented Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). During this particular meeting, which included reviews of SALT policy and developments in China, the discussion turned to the problem of nuclear proliferation. Worried about loose command-and-control arrangements in new nuclear states and the possibility that nuclear use in an India-Pakistan conflict could \"increase temptations for their use elsewhere,\" Kissinger asserted that \"we should move heaven and earth\" to curb proliferation. \"Even if we can buy only a decade [it is] worth it to prevent it.\"\nDocuments 25a-b: The ENTEC Facility \"Bears Watching\"\n25a: U.S. Embassy Tehran Cable 1232 to State Department, \"Nuclear Power: Comments of Head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI),\" 7 February 1977, Unclassified\n25b: U.S. Embassy Tehran Cable 1437 to State Department, \"GOI/AEOI Plans for Isfhahan Nuclear Technology Center, ENTEC,\" 14 February 1977, Secret\nSource: Mandatory Review\nFollowing President Ford's electoral defeat, Richard Helms resigned from his post in Tehran in late 1976, and a void at the Embassy's top level ensued for some months. Nevertheless, with a new administration at the White House determined to make major changes in nuclear proliferation policy, the government of Iran was waiting with interest for a U.S. announcement. During a press conference in February 1977, Etemad, perhaps realizing that the Carter administration would also oppose reprocessing, declared that Iran had given up the option of a national reprocessing facility and was, instead, looking closely at binational and multinational options. In addition, Etemad said that he assumed that safeguards would be integral to the U.S. approach, but asserted that no country \"has a right to dictate nuclear policy to another.\" He also announced the beginning of construction of the third and fourth French-supplied nuclear power plants.\nOfficials at the U.S. Embassy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who had been visiting Iran, were not taking on faith Etemad's statements on reprocessing. When Oak Ridge officials received a briefing on the planned Esfehan Nuclear Technology Center (ENTEC), U.S. officials commented that the location reminded them of the geologically similar site (\"between two mountains\") of the Sandia Weapons Laboratory in New Mexico. According to the Oak Ridge scientists, the \"unusually large\" size of the facility \"makes it theoretically possible to produce weapons-grade material (plutonium)\", although it was not yet possible to make \"categorical statements.\" It would be just as possible for the facility to produce \"mixed oxide appropriate for reactor cores.\" In any event, that the plans for ENTEC included a \"large hot lab,\" the first step toward reprocessing, as well as a \"fuel nuclear fuel cycle … but only on a pilot plant scale\" encouraged the Oak Ridge officials to \"conclude that the … entire facility 'bears watching.'\"\nDocument 26: U.S. Policy Review\nState Department cable 42988 to Embassy Tehran, \"U.S.-Iran Bilateral Agreement for Nuclear Cooperation,\" 25 February 1977, Confidential\nSource: Mandatory Review\nThe nuclear negotiations with Iran could not be resumed until the Carter White House had finished its nuclear proliferation policy review. Realizing that the \"ball is in our court,\" the State Department asked U.S. diplomats in Tehran to assure Etemad that \"the new administration is moving along expeditiously in its comprehensive policy review\" and that decisions would be made in March or April.\nDocument 27: Carter's Nonproliferation Policy Announcement and Its Impact\nU.S. Consulate Shiraz Airgram A-16 to Department of State, \"The Persepolis Conference on Transfer of Nuclear Technology: A Layman's View,\" 18 April 1977, Confidential\nSource: Mandatory Review\nThe Carter administration's policy review took longer than anticipated, but on 7 April, President Carter issued his first official policy statement on nuclear proliferation. The key announcement was the decision to defer \"indefinitely\" commercial reprocessing in the United States in order to discourage other countries from reprocessing. While acknowledging that nuclear exporters like France and West Germany had a \"perfect right\" to reprocess spent fuel and that Washington did not want to \"impose [its] will on them,\" he wanted to reach a \"worldwide understanding\" with them to curb the risks of widespread reprocessing capabilities. To show that the United States would be a reliable supplier of nuclear fuel, President Carter announced that he would be proposing to Congress \"legislative steps to permit us to sign … supply contracts and remove the pressure for the reprocessing of nuclear fuels.\" In response to press questions about the multinational reprocessing option that the Ford administration had considered, Carter said that he had not made a decision but that \"regional plants under tight international control\" were a possibility that would be explored. (Note 7)\nCarter's statement came on the eve of an international conference on nuclear technology in Persepolis that the Iranian government sponsored. As Victor Tomseth, the U.S. consul in Shiraz later reported, the reaction at the conference was \"immediate and for the most part quite negative.\" U.S. businessmen in the atomic industry were nonplussed because they believed that White House policy would hurt them; Washington, they believed, should not worry about curbing sales of \"technology [that developing nations] can get from other sources.\" U.S. competitors in the nuclear field, for example, in West Germany, were disturbed because Carter's statements cast doubt on the \"wisdom of … reprocessing and the breeder reactor.\" Commercial competitors also believed that Carter's policy would have only a \"marginal\" impact on nonproliferation. Representatives of Third World countries agreed with that, but what especially worried them was that \"their lives had once again been impinged upon by policy decisions in the United States over which they had no control.\" This dovetailed with the views expressed by Iranian officials that \"no country had the right to dictate nuclear policy to another.\"\nDocument 28: Explaining Carter's Policy\nU.S. Embassy Tehran cable 4313 to State Department, \"US-Iran Nuclear Cooperation Agreement and US-Iran Energy Discussions,\" 16 May 1977, Confidential\nSource: Mandatory Review\nA visit to Tehran by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Sidney Sober provided an occasion for a discussion with Etemad on the Carter administration's nuclear nonproliferation policy, including its commitment to be a \"reliable supplier\" to countries that shared U.S. nonproliferation objectives. Commending Etemad for his statement disavowing reprocessing, Sober observed that Iran's decision would \"substantially facilitate our bilateral negotiations.\" Once Congress had finalized nuclear energy legislation, Tehran and Washington could resume the nuclear power negotiations. While Etemad suggested that Washington should be doing more to share nuclear technology as required under Article 4 of the Nonproliferation Treaty, Sober reminded him that such actions could not endanger NPT objectives.\nDocuments 29a-b: Request for Highly Enriched Uranium\n29a: U.S. Embassy Tehran cable 4198 to State Department, \"Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) Export to Iran,\" 12 May 1977, Confidential\n29b: State Department cable 115011 to Embassy Tehran, \"HEU Exports to Iran,\" 19 May 1977, Confidential\nSource: Mandatory Review\nThe State Department's decision to put on hold an Iranian request for 20.2 kilograms of highly-enriched uranium [HEU] for the Tehran Research Reactor met with a skeptical response from DCM Miklos, who worried that it might \"feed [Iran's] worst fears\" about the U.S.'s reliability as a nuclear supplier. The HEU at issue was slated to refuel, and help increase the power level of, the Tehran reactor. Under existing agreements with Iran, however, the limit was 6 kilograms; moreover, Washington's concern about overseas inventories of HEU and the \"special risk\" that they posed influenced new guidelines requiring presidential approval for exports. According to Deputy of State Warren Christopher, the United States did not want to \"impugn\" Iran's nonproliferation intentions and was confident that Iran would understand U.S. motives. Moreover, negotiation of the nuclear power agreement would provide an opportunity to address the problem of the ceiling of HEU exports to Iran.\nDocument 30: Waiting for the Iranians to \"Put All their Cards on the Table\"\nU.S. Embassy Tehran cable 5397 to State Department, \"Audience with Shah,\" 20 June 1977, Confidential\nSource: Mandatory Review\nIn June 1977, a new ambassador, career foreign service officer William Sullivan, arrived in Tehran, presenting his credentials to the Shah on 18 June. During their meeting, the Shah told Sullivan that he was ready to resume the nuclear power negotiations and expressed hope that the reactors would be sold. As Sullivan explained in his cable, he did not follow up on the Shah's observations because he wanted the Iranians to \"put all their cards on the table\" before using the guidance that President Carter had given him. Sullivan did not want to \"look too eager.\" Moreover, he was concerned that U.S. government agencies had not fully digested President Carter's new policies and needed time to \"catch up\" so they would be ready for the negotiations with Iran scheduled to begin on 25 July.\nThe Shah's \"specific disavowal of interest in reprocessing plant\" met with a skeptical response from the cartoonist at ISA's Iran desk who drew a little picture of a bull next to those words.\nDocuments 31a-b: Final Agreement\n31a: State Department cable 125971 to Embassy Tehran, \"U.S.-Iran Nuclear Cooperation Agreement,\" 17 May 1978, Confidential\n31b: Department of State cable 226045 to Embassy Canberra, \"Provisions of US-Iranian Nuclear Agreement,\" 6 September 1978, Secret/Limdis\nSource: Mandatory Review\nDocumentation on the U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations during 1977 and early 1978 is scarce, pending future declassifications. While State Department officials had hoped that early Congressional action on White House nonproliferation objectives would expedite the agreement with Iran, Carter did not sign the Nonproliferation Act until March 1978. The month before, U.S. and Iranian officials had completed the negotiations, perhaps expedited by a brief conversation that President Carter had with the Shah during his visit to Iran in late December 1977. (This was the visit where Carter had famously referred to Iran as an \"island of stability.\") (Note 8)\nIn May 1978, the State Department sent a draft agreement to Tehran. Like the 1976 agreement, the objective was to avoid proliferation risks, but the Carter administration took a slightly different approach to reprocessing. In article 6, Iran would not reprocess spent fuel or enrich uranium supplied by the U.S. \"unless the parties agree.\" This was not terribly different from the Ford administration's language that reprocessing must be \"performed in facilities acceptable to the parties.\" The United States retained a veto. The key differences were in the separate note, which was more detailed than the 1976 version. Besides including language on physical security, expeditious NRC action on licenses, and international fuel cycle studies, the note provided alternative arrangements for spent fuel resulting from U.S.-supplied material: 1) storage in Iran, 2) storage in the U.S., or 3) storage, processing, or other disposition … in accordance with internationally accepted arrangements.\" The latter could involve reprocessing in the UK, France, or \"other mutually agreed states and return of recovered plutonium in the form of fabricated fuel to Iran, under arrangements which are deemed to be more proliferation resistant than those which currently exist.\"\nThere would be no reprocessing in Iran under any circumstances and buy-back was no longer an option. Moreover, to a great extent, reprocessing in Western Europe could occur only if storage was not possible in Iran, the United States, or in Western Europe. According to a cable sent some months later, during the negotiations Washington wanted reprocessing in Western Europe to be \"an option of last resort,\" but Tehran wanted it to be an \"equal choice.\" What the Iranians feared was a discriminatory outcome: the \"US would strike a deal with others to allow commercial-scale reprocessing subsequent to US-Iran agreement.\" To accommodate the Iranians on that point, without sacrificing nonproliferation objectives, Washington agreed to a separate paragraph which spelled out circumstances under which non-discriminatory treatment would be possible and reprocessing in Europe would be more than a \"last resort.\" In any event, any such option would be \"subject to US law which includes determination of no significant increase in the risk of proliferation associated with approvals for reprocessing.\"\nDocuments 32a-b:\n32a: U.S. Embassy Tehran cable 7863 to State Department, \"Reassessment of Iran's Nuclear Energy Plans,\" 17 August 1978, Confidential\n32b: U.S. Embassy Tehran cable 9154 to State Department, \"Nuclear Activities in Iran,\" 21 September 1978, Confidential\nSource: Mandatory Review\nBy the early summer of 1978, senior U.S. and Iranian officials had \"initialed\" the nuclear agreement, but President Carter had not yet approved it, so it had not been formally signed by either party. State Department officials acted as if signing was a possibility, but the ongoing collapse of the Shah's regime put everything, including the Iranian nuclear program, up in the air. The Embassy interpreted an editorial on nuclear policy in Kayhan International as a sign that some in the government wanted to renegotiate the nuclear deal with Washington, partly because of the provisions on reprocessing. A month later, a new prime minister, Jafaar Sharif-Emami, was in charge and Etemad resigned his position as atomic energy chief, with other changes at the nuclear agency possible. Major cut-backs in government capital investment programs, the Embassy reported, have \"essentially paralyzed the decision-making process in both AEOI and Ministry of Energy on matters nuclear.\" Except for the four reactors under construction, \"Nuclear activity …has come to a halt.\" Nevertheless, Iranian officials told a local representative of the Westinghouse Corporation that the government wanted to work with the U.S. nuclear industry and that \"the bilateral would certainly not be scrapped.\" That, however, proved to be wishful thinking; with major cities under martial law, a revolutionary crisis was unfolding that put an end to any possibility of U.S.-Iran nuclear cooperation.\nNotes\n1.

I am Ira Flatow.\nThe flow of oil has been disrupted this week by Hurricane Katrina. And within a week we've seen--with the prices of gasoline skyrocketing at your pump, I'm sure you've seen that. So for the rest of the hour, we're going to get a report on the damage done by Katrina to the Gulf's oil operations. We'll talk about how that translates into higher prices at the pump and possibly how soon that might come down or what is the state of--how do you get out of the Gulf and where does it go to? Maybe you've been talking about that amongst yourselves. Well, you can talk about it with us. Our number: 1 (800) 989-8255.\nRayola Dougher (pronounced Dough-er) is a manager of energy market issues at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington. It's Dougher (pronounced do-er), I'm sorry. She joins us today by phone from her office there.\nWelcome to the program.\nMs. RAYOLA DOUGHER (American Petroleum Institute): Oh, thank you for inviting me.\nFLATOW: Oh, you're welcome. Your phone must be pretty busy these days.\nMs. DOUGHER: It sure is. It's ringing off the hook. It really is. We--it just doesn't even wait. The light just says red all day.\n(Soundbite of laughter)\nFLATOW: Let's talk about the oil. The president said today, and we saw some statistics, that the oil is beginning to flow a little bit more?\nMs. DOUGHER: Yes, it is. They're getting a number of platforms back up and operating. There's still a lot of shutting capacity, but the--relatively little damage done, well, compared to the magnitude of the storm. I think a number of people were pleased that it wasn't even worse than it was. But there's still significant production out in the Gulf. Every day it gets better. But still about 90 percent of the daily production in the Gulf of Mexico is shut in. And it's the equivalent of about, oh, I'd say almost 25 percent of total domestic production of crude oil shut in. So not only...\nFLATOW: Shut in means shut down?\nMs. DOUGHER: Not producing.\nFLATOW: Not produce...\nMs. DOUGHER: Not producing. And then we also have a lot of refineries out, shut down in the area. They're not turning out product. And they represent about 10 to 11 percent of US refining capacity of all the products put out there, the natural--I mean, the gasoline and distillates. And then we have another, oh, gosh, almost 16 percent of refineries around the nation operating on reduced runs because they're not getting the crude primarily from the Gulf. And that--a lot of it has to do with the electricity. And that's coming up. But there are huge pipelines that go up from the Gulf of Mexico into the central region in the country and up--a huge pipeline, Colonial Pipeline. It goes from the Gulf and feeds the whole Northeast all the way up into New Jersey. And that's been operating on reduced capacity. It's only starting to get back up and going. And as this electricity comes on especially over the weekend, I think we're going to see a lot of progress made quickly. At least everyone's very hopeful about that...\nFLATOW: Tell us what happens at an oil rig when you get a hurricane coming into the Gulf. What goes on? Do they shut it down? Do they close the pipes? You know...\nMs. DOUGHER: They do. They have all sorts of...\nFLATOW: ...what is going on there?\nMs. DOUGHER: They have all sorts of safety valves and pumps and you name it. They have to shut it off so that--and they evacuate these platforms, too. We have an estimated 30 to 35,000 workers on rigs in the Gulf. There are 4,000 oil rigs. So far, we have a an estimate that 41 of those 4,000 were damaged, most of them small rigs. So that's good. No injuries that we know of in terms of evacuating the employees from these rigs. But most of these people live and work in that region. And a big problem for the industry now is they're just searching for some of their employees too. And it's been very difficult...\nFLATOW: Yeah. Yeah.\nMs. DOUGHER: ...for a lot of people, and they're trying to reach them, you know, they're trying to...\nFLATOW: Yeah, I can understand that.\nMs. DOUGHER: Yeah.\nFLATOW: We've also seen pictures of a couple of oil rigs just washing up on the surface.\nMs. DOUGHER: Sure.\nFLATOW: What happens to the hole in the ground? Is oil coming out of the place they broke off at the bottom of the Gulf?\nMs. DOUGHER: They haven't even had time to really go underwater yet and see what's happened underwater to all those. But there's thousands of miles of pipeline underwater in the Gulf, and not all of those have been checked out yet either. The most they've gotten to do in some of these areas is get back on the rigs themselves, on the platforms, and start up some operations in some scattered areas. But they still have yet to determine the magnitude of the damage underwater. We really don't have a clear picture of that. There are a few slicks around, but we still don't know about that.\nFLATOW: Yeah, there were some--there were talks of a couple of oil spills today. Can you fill us in on those at all?\nMs. DOUGHER: You know, I don't know of any today. The other day there was a spill of 800 barrels of condensate. It's a very light petroleum product and it dissipates very quickly in the water. But the Marine Spill Response crew was there and looking after that one. And I haven't heard of any other major spills. We do have a spill person who was in touch with the Coast Guard and others in the past hour or so...\nFLATOW: Yeah.\nMs. DOUGHER: ...and they said nothing major, although there are smaller things going on that we're aware of.\nFLATOW: Would it be fair to say that under the Gulf itself, there are all bunches of kinds of pipelines running down there that we never see?\nMs. DOUGHER: Thousands of miles of it.\nFLATOW: Thousands of miles.\nMs. DOUGHER: Thousands of miles of it.\nFLATOW: Are these buried under or are they on the surface of the sea bed?\nMs. DOUGHER: Now that's a good question. I'm not sure about that, how they handle those pipelines.\nFLATOW: Yeah.\nMs. DOUGHER: I really don't know that question, if they bury them or...\nFLATOW: That's the kind of stuff we ask on SCIENCE FRIDAY, those tiny, nagging details that no one ever can answer.\nMs. DOUGHER: Shoot!\n(Soundbite of laughter)\nMs. DOUGHER: Got me!\nFLATOW: How big are those valves inside those pipes?\nMs. DOUGHER: Oh, gee...\nFLATOW: What's the diameter of the pipe, you know? All these geeky questions that we...\nMs. DOUGHER: Well, it's...\nFLATOW: Our listeners want to know those answers.\nMs. DOUGHER: I know. They're great questions. And it's just, you know, I've worked here 20 years and I'm just continually stunned by some of the things I don't know. It's like...\nFLATOW: It's a humbling experience, is it not? It certainly is for me. Are they any reports of damage to the pipeline that's down there at all? Do you know?\nMs. DOUGHER: I think the big pipelines, it's just really they have the reduced capacity because of the electricity. And they're not reporting any major damage. These are the big ones...\nFLATOW: Yeah.\nMs. DOUGHER: ...that pump the crude and the products to market. And for them, they're doing well. It's just getting the electricity on and going. So that's going to be very good because--especially for people in the Northeast, Atlanta, and some other areas where there's sporadic outages for some. And this should help alleviate this very soon.\nFLATOW: Let's talking about getting their refineries back on line again. You mentioned the employees that were evacuated...\nMs. DOUGHER: Yes.\nFLATOW: ...and you need to find them and hopefully you can get them back to work. What else needs to be done?\nMs. DOUGHER: It takes awhile...\nFLATOW: Do you need the electricity? Is it a power problem?\nMs. DOUGHER: You got electricity and you also--there are reports of some with saltwater damage. Now that can do a lot of damage if it's saltwater in terms of all the equipment and getting it back and running. You have to get rid of all the water in the area. And then you have to do all sorts of safety checks on every piece of equipment before you can start up again. And then it takes, from the time you get the barrel of crude oil into the refinery itself until you have a product, that would take about four days. So you're looking at, you know, possibly a week for some of these to get a really good picture of how much longer they're going to be out or will they all be back and up and running within the week? We just don't know.\nLast year when Ivan came through, one of the refineries--you know, they were flooded, of course. And one of them had to--in their control room, they had alligators and snakes they had to clear out first.\nFLATOW: Wow.\nMs. DOUGHER: So we just don't even know what some of them are going to face.\nFLATOW: Right.\nMs. DOUGHER: Others have skeleton crews around. So...\nFLATOW: Right.\nMs. DOUGHER: And we just don't have any picture of what really they've been going through for some of them.\nFLATOW: You don't--1 (800) 989-8255 is our number. We're talking about oil and pipelines this hour, last part of SCIENCE FRIDAY, with Ray Dougher, manager of energy marketing issues at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington.\nI'm about to ask you a question I haven't asked in 30 years.\nMs. DOUGHER: Uh-oh.\nFLATOW: When I was working at NPR in Washington...\n(Soundbite of laughter)\nFLATOW: And, you know, I'm going to get the same answer I got 30 years ago, I'm sure.\nMs. DOUGHER: What's that?\nFLATOW: The same question everybody's been asking you. Who's gouging our prices at the pump, you know? Remember that--deja vu all over again from me asking this question. As a reporter covering, you now, the energy crisis in the '70s, I was asking the same question.\nMs. DOUGHER: You know...\nFLATOW: And that's what everybody wants to know.\nMs. DOUGHER: Oh, sure. And, you know, what's happened, of course, is that we've had a severe supply disruption for a major portion of the industry, those statistics I just gave you. And the producers, the refiners, the operators, the retail outlets, they're all trying to adjust to this really big reduction in their supplies. They're scrambling to get supplies to their customers. But, you know, ultimately, there are about 168, almost 170,000 retail outlets in the United States...\nFLATOW: Yeah.\nMs. DOUGHER: ...and less than 10 percent of them are owned by refiners. The rest are independent businessmen and women. They're making their business decisions every day. And--you know, and many states have price-gouging...\nFLATOW: Yeah.\nMs. DOUGHER: ...laws.\nFLATOW: Yeah.\nMs. DOUGHER: And some of them have already instituted emergency procedures to halt any really sharp increase in price. But it really is a logical market response to a scarcity. And we're seeing that.\nFLATOW: From reading between the Washington lines here, it's basically you're saying that the individual owners are taking you for a ride.\nMs. DOUGHER: No.\nFLATOW: The gas station attendants, you know...\nMs. DOUGHER: No, I don't want to imply that. It's more complicated than that. You know, it's all the way up the distribution chain. If you think of first the producers are--their production is cut, and then you get to the refiners, they're output is cut. And then...\nFLATOW: But don't you pay for oil, like, a month in advance for what you know you're going to be getting? You pay a price for a certain future of oil, you know...\nMs. DOUGHER: Sure. Sure.\nFLATOW: ...what--and it's locked in for the next month?\nMs. DOUGHER: Sure, but then the scarcity occurs and then the customer whose source of supply is gone is going to someone else that might have supply and willing to offer a higher price for that same supply. And this is what's happening. People are scrambling in the marketplace. And it's lots of decisions, thousands and thousands made every day, that are pushing that price upward. It starts with the crude. Most of what we spend at the gasoline pump is the cost of the crude oil alone.\nFLATOW: Right.\nMs. DOUGHER: And that was what? That was around $70 this week, wasn't it? Something like that.\nFLATOW: Yeah. Yeah.\nMs. DOUGHER: So that brings you up to $1.67 is just the price of the crude. And...\nFLATOW: Now you work for the American Petroleum Institute.\nMs. DOUGHER: Sure.\nFLATOW: Are you ever going to include, like, biofuels in the petroleum institute, like biodiesel or anything of those kinds of alternative energies that...\nMs. DOUGHER: Well, the industry already makes...\nFLATOW: ...you could consider petroleum...\nMs. DOUGHER: Sure. They are already working, you know, on blending ethanol...\nFLATOW: Right.\nMs. DOUGHER: ...that's made out of corn and a lot of--and different alternative fuels, too. So that's already integrated into the industry. It's mandated by Congress. But they've been using ethanol around the country, in California and New York now for a couple of years. And it'll be coming on in a much bigger fashion over the next few years as we get out of other additives and start using more ethanol. And biodiesel, all of these fuels, some of these alternatives have become, you know, an option. They are heavily subsidized, you know, by federal tax incentive. And that's what makes them somewhat viable. But we are using them in our fuels today. About, oh, I'd say, how many? Five million barrels a day--I mean, a year--are ethanol. So we do use some ethanol and we will be using more. And I don't know about the biodiesel, how long that would take to...\nFLATOW: Yeah.\nMs. DOUGHER: ...get into the marketplace. But it's there.\nFLATOW: Yeah. I'm waiting for it to buy my diesel.\nMs. DOUGHER: Are you?\nFLATOW: Oh, yeah. I'm getting 40 miles a gallon, you know, so...\nMs. DOUGHER: Are you? Great.\nFLATOW: So--I drove round trip to Washington from New York on 25 bucks.\nMs. DOUGHER: Oh, see?\nFLATOW: 1 (800) 9--a week ago. 1 (800) 989-8255 is our number. We're talking about the energy crisis as part of the hurricane this hour on TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.\nLet's go to the phones, to Don in Howell, Michigan. Hi, Don.\nDON (Caller): Hi. How you doing?\nFLATOW: Hi there.\nDON: I was just wondering--I'm getting rather confused because I was watching a fair and balanced news report yesterday, and when Bush released some oil from the national oil reserves, they said this was more of a calming effect, that they really didn't need the oil. What the problem was was a lack of refinery capability. Now with seven of them down in the Gulf Coast, and they said it would reduce our flow by 10 percent, I guess my main question is when was the last refinery built in this country and why are they always operating at full capacity. Why don't we have some that are, like, on standby in case of emergency? This just doesn't make sense to me. It's almost like it's manufactured.\nMs. DOUGHER: OK. Why don't I start with the SPR first, releasing of that. There are 12 refineries in the Midwest now operating at reduced run because they can't get the crude from the Gulf of Mexico. So those refineries will be able to borrow the crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Five refineries during Ivan last year did the same thing and then they pay it back, the amount that they borrow. So this will help the marketplace because it'll help the refineries in the Midwest get up and running faster than they would've otherwise.\nAnd then in terms of the refineries in the United States, it's true we haven't built a new refinery since about 1976, but I think one of the points that gets lost sometimes is that over this period of time, we are producing record amounts, more than we've ever produced. We produce about 90 percent of the gasoline we consume. And each year, we continue to produce about 90 percent and we import about 10 percent, most of it in the Northeast, New York and the New England states. But having said that, we have a system that is maxed out. It's 97 percent capacity. It's running day and night. And this storm has been a big hit to that.\nAnd the reasons that it hasn't expanded faster are both economic and they're also political. The return on the investment in the refining sector has been very poor compared to other sectors of the industry for a long time now. But also it's been hard to build on the existing capacity or even build a new refinery. There's one new refinery trying to get up and running in Arizona for a long time now. They have spent 10 years trying to get permits to go through just the paperwork alone. Most areas don't want refineries in their back yard. And just this summer, the government suggested that maybe some of these closed military bases could be used for siting new refineries. And I think that that may be a really good option to explore, both with the communities and also with the oil industry. So that is what's going on in the refining sector.\nDON: I just don't understand that--I mean, this is basically--not basically, it really is--a matter of national security as far as economics and security. If some of those refineries were to be bombed or taken--I mean, I remember last summer, I think it was last year that we had a fire here in the Midwest in one of the refineries. And all of a sudden here in Detroit the prices went up by 15 cents a gallon just because one refinery went down. This...\nMs. DOUGHER: You're absolutely right...\nDON: ...is ridiculous in a country this size.\nMs. DOUGHER: We, the industry, agrees with you fully and really has been very active with Congress and trying to move legislation through to help facilitate the expansion of refineries in the United States. We recognize that we are a system stretched really, really thin. And all it takes now, as you said, one refinery going down and it's enough to send the prices skyrocketing. And that's--you know, because of that thin line--if we had more capacity and more we could bring on, you wouldn't see that kind of volatility. We see that in the crude marketplace, too, same thing. We do have a lot of resources here that are off-limits. And that's one of the reasons a lot of our industries concentrate in the Gulf of Mexico because that region welcomes the industry there. But there are a lot of resources in other areas around our nation that have been placed off-limits and they would be economic to explore.\nFLATOW: All right. Ray, I want to thank you very much. I'm still asking the same questions I did 30 years ago.\nMs. DOUGHER: It never changes.\nFLATOW: Getting the same answers. So I want to thank you for being consistent with me.\nMs. DOUGHER: I'm sticking to my story.\nFLATOW: There you go. Ray Dougher is manager of energy market issues at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington. Thank you for taking time to talk with us.\nMs. DOUGHER: Thank you.

Hammons Convention Center\nJoplin, Missouri\nAugust 11, 2004\n12:30 P.M. CDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Well, thank you very much, Lynne. We're delighted to be here this morning, and have an opportunity to spend some time with all of you in southwestern Missouri. Roy Blunt is a great friend of mine. We work very closely together. He does a superb job, I know, for all of you as your congressman, and a great job as Majority Leader in the House. (Applause.) Might I add that Kit Bond is no slouch either as United States senator. (Applause.)\nThe fact is that was a very impressive red dress. (Laughter.) But I often explain to people that Lynne and I got married because Dwight Eisenhower got elected President of the United States in 1952. It's a stretch to think that presidential elections have those kinds of consequences. But in 1952, I lived with my folks in Lincoln, Nebraska. Dad worked for the Soil Conservation Service. Eisenhower got elected, reorganized the Agriculture Department, and Dad got transferred to Casper, Wyoming -- which is where I met Lynne, and that's the famous red dress. And we grew up together and went to high school together, and we'll mark our 40th wedding anniversary in about two weeks. (Applause.) But I explained to a group the other night if it hadn't been for Dwight Eisenhower's election victory, Lynne would have married somebody else. (Laughter.) And she said, right, and now he'd be Vice President of the United States. (Laughter.)\nBut I don't know how many of you watched program out of Boston here a couple weeks ago. They had a political do up there that some of us watched. And it's official now -- I have an opponent. (Laughter.) I really do have an opponent. I heard my daughter's smart remark as she introduced me. And people keep telling me, they say, John Edwards got selected to be Vice President because he's sexy, charming, has great hair. And I said, \"How do you think I got the job?\" (Laughter and applause.)\nWhat we'd like to do this morning -- I've got a few remarks I'd like to share with all of you. And then we'd like to open it up to questions, have a chance to respond to your concerns. Lynne is here with me to respond to questions, as well, too. As I say, this is a somewhat experimental format. We've done several town hall meetings, but this is the first time that we've tried to do one together. So we are experimenting, so we think it might be interesting.\nMS. CHENEY: It's a test of our marriage. (Laughter.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: It is a test. (Laughter.) But what I'd like to do is just take a minute and talk about the enormous stakes in terms of the decision we're going to make on November 2nd. Because the -- I've been involved in politics, I guess, off and on now for over 30 years. And I can't think of a more important election during my lifetime in terms of the decision we're going to make about where we go as a nation, especially with respect to our national security policy.\nWe're in a situation now where if you think about it -- and I find it useful to go back and reflect on where we were on January 20th, of 2001, the day the President and I were sworn in, and what the world was like then, and what has transpired since. It helps put in perspective, and I think poses for us some of the issues that we will be deciding when we go to the polls and decide who is going to be President for the next four years -- and even bigger than that, I think who is going to set the course for the nation maybe for the next half century -- very, very important decision we're about to make.\nIf you reflect back on January 20th, of 2001, when we were sworn in that day, the planning for the attack of 9/11 was already well underway. Most of the terrorists had already been recruited. Many of them had been through the training camps in Afghanistan, where they trained to kill Americans. Some of them were already in the United States. They'd raised the money. They'd been planning that attack since 1996, five years before. It took them that long to get all the pieces put together. But they're very patient. They're absolutely lethal, and once they put their mind on a target like that, they operated according to their timetable, not ours or anybody else's. But all the planning for 9/11 was well underway.\nWe also had a situation in Afghanistan where the Taliban had taken over, and had turned Afghanistan into a training camp for terrorists, into a safe haven for terrorists -- specifically for the al Qaeda organization. So there were thousands of them there, including Osama bin Laden, the leader. And they had turned out sometime in the late '90s, between 1997 and about 2000, they'd trained -- 20,000 terrorists had gone through those camps, and then spread back out around the world to some 60 different countries, including here in the United States, where they set up terror cells.\nIn Iraq, Saddam Hussein was in power. He'd started two wars. He had provided safe haven and sanctuary for terrorists for many, many years. He was paying $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers. He provided a home for al Qaeda, and for Abu Nidal. He had generally been -- he'd also obviously developed and used weapons of mass destruction in the past, both against the Iraqis and the Iranians.\nAnd we had a couple of other developments in that part of the world that were not public at the time that were very important. The A.Q. Khan network was in business. Mr. Khan was a Pakistani, a man who had acquired and then developed the technology to develop nuclear weapons. He knew how to acquire the uranium feedstock, to design the centrifuges to enrich the uranium, and he had a weapons design. And he had, in fact, been the father of the Pakistan nuclear program. And once he completed that task, he had diverted this whole network to his own purposes. And he was selling nuclear weapons technology to North Korea, to Iran, and to Libya.\nMoammar Ghadafi in Libya was spending millions of dollars to acquire this capability and was well on his way. Once that whole process had been completed, he would have been in possession then of nuclear weapons. He wasn't there yet, but he was working on it.\nWe also had a situation in the fact that the terrorists had learned two unfortunate lessons, if you will, at our expense in the prior period of time before we were sworn in. They'd learned, first of all, that they could strike at the United States with relative impunity -- because they had, repeatedly. And the best response we usually came up with was to treat each attack as some kind of criminal enterprise. We'd go after the individuals who'd launched the attack. Sometimes we'd catch them, put them in prison. But we never really reached behind the individuals to look at the networks that had undertaken these attacks.\nOf course, we'd been hit in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983, when we lost 241 Marines, when they blew up the barracks; 1993, first attack on the World Trade Center; 1996, Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia; 1998, the East Africa Embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya; 2000, the USS Cole -- a whole sequence of attacks, most of which had gone unanswered, or the answer had been a law enforcement response. Once we fired off a few cruise missiles at a training camp in Afghanistan. But from the standpoint of the terrorists, they could strike us, and there was no real penalty to be paid.\nAnd the second lesson they'd learned was that if they hit us hard enough, they could change or policy -- because they had. After we got hit in Lebanon in 1983, in relatively short order we pulled out of Lebanon completely. In 1993, in Mogadishu -- there, they killed 19 of our soldiers, and within a matter of weeks, we'd withdrawn all of our forces from Somalia. And so those two lessons -- if you hit the U.S., and you won't be struck in return; and if you hit the U.S., and you can change U.S. policy if you do it -- and that was sort of the set of circumstances that were out there when we were sworn in.\nAnd then the attack of 9/11 came, and, of course, it changed everything. I think everybody came to realize at that moment that we were, in fact, at war -- that we'd been at war for some time. Our enemies knew it; we didn't. We hadn't really as a nation come to grips with that basic fundamental proposition.\nBut 9/11 changed everything in the sense that it forced us to think anew about our enemies, about who our enemies were, about the kind of threat we faced as a nation, about what kind of strategy we needed to pursue to be able to safeguard our nation from those attacks. The President made a very basic, fundamental decision that very first night after the attacks. And that was that henceforth, we would hold accountable those -- not only the terrorists, but also those who supported terror. If a state or a government provided safe harbor or sanctuary, or financing, or training or weapons to a terrorist organization, they would be deemed just as guilty of the terrorist act as the terrorists themselves.\nAnd the first place we put that principle to test was in Afghanistan. We went into Afghanistan, and in a matter of weeks, we took down the Taliban government, captured or killed hundreds of al Qaeda, put Osama bin Laden on the run. We haven't captured him yet, but we haven't given up. And we will get him eventually, I'm convinced. We closed all the training camps where they've trained, as I say, some 20,000 terrorists to kill Americans and others.\nAnd subsequent to that, we, of course, now -- they've stood up an interim government. They have a President in place. They've got a constitution. They'll hold free elections later this fall. Schools are open. And the economy is beginning to thrive. Young girls can go to school now -- something they weren't able to do before -- a pretty significant transition, a lot of work to be done yet.\nIn Iraq, we went into Iraq obviously very aggressively, took down the government. Saddam Hussein today is in jail, exactly where he belongs. (Applause.) But his sons are dead. His government is out of business. He's no longer in a position to be able to threaten anybody. And we've still got an awful lot of work to do in Iraq. I don't want to underestimate the difficulty of the task. Nobody should. We're going to be involved there for some considerable period of time.\nBut we've got a good man in Prime Minister Allawi, who's taken over. The Iraqis now are running all of the government ministries. We're standing up Iraqi security forces and training and equipping them so that they'll soon be able to move in, take over more and more responsibility to provide for their own security. They also have a constitutional process now set up. They'll hold elections next January. They're on their way, as well, to establishing a self-governing administration, if you will, in Iraq that will never again be a threat to its neighbors or to the United States -- a very, very important piece of business.\nAs we went through this process, Moammar Ghadafi in Libya watched what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq, and then five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, he went public and announced he was going to give up all of his aspirations to have weapons of mass destruction. And he did. (Applause.) And all of that material today, the weapons designs, the uranium feedstock, the enrichment machinery and so forth is all now under lock and key over at Oak Ridge, in Tennessee, where it ought to be -- safe and never again be put to that use.\nMr. Khan, the man who ran the suppliers' network is under house arrest in Pakistan. His suppliers' network is closed down. The worse source of proliferation of nuclear weapons technology that we've ever seen is now out of business. He's not going to sell anything to anybody. (Applause.)\nAll of that is what we've been able to accomplish over the last three-and-a-half years. But it's very important for people to understand that this is perhaps the end of the beginning, but we have a very long way to go. This is a threat that we're going to have to deal with probably for our lifetime. It's not like any war we've ever been engaged with before. When you think about World War II, and the length of time we were actually engaged from Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, till Germany surrendered in May of '45, or Japan in September of '45, those were relatively brief conflicts. The worst conflicts in our history, but relatively there was a beginning, there was a middle, and there was an end, and then the war was over with. This is a situation in which it's a very different enemy -- when you think about their motives, what they're trying to do. They're obviously trying to impose their very radical extremist ideology on everybody else. They have no tolerance for democracy. They have no tolerance for other views with respect to people who want to pursue a different religious faith, for example. They are perfectly prepared to kill anybody who stands in their way.\nThey are also prepared to use weapons of mass destruction if they can ever get their hands on them. And the worst proposition we face today by way of a threat is the possibility of an al Qaeda cell in the middle of one of our own cities with a biological agent, like smallpox, maybe, or a nuclear weapon of some kind that they would be prepared to detonate. And there's nothing to restrain them. There's no reason why they wouldn't use that kind of capability once they get their hands on it.\nOur old strategies from the Cold War worked great against the Soviets, but the whole concept of deterrence means nothing when you're talking about an al Qaeda terrorist who is prepared to die for Allah, and whose purpose here is to take as many people with him as he possibly can -- primarily Americans. That's the kind of adversary we're faced with here for the foreseeable future. It doesn't take large numbers of them. Nineteen hijackers, we saw what they could do on 9/11 when they killed 3,000 of our people in a couple of hours on a beautiful September morning without any provocation whatsoever.\nPart of the debate that we'll be dealing with this years is over this question of when is it appropriate to use U.S. military force, when are we justified in moving aggressively against a sponsor of terror, or a group of terrorists, or of taking military action, if that's what is called for, in order to defend the United States.\nThere are those who believe we should never be preemptive, that we should never take that first step. But when you consider the threat, when you consider the consequences of failing to deal with the threat might, in fact, be the destruction of one of our own cities, then I think it begins to put things in perspective -- that it's absolutely essential to do exactly what the President has done, which is to say that United States will not wait for the next attack. We're not going to stand by and let somebody take a shot at us before we respond. We've put them on notice now that if you have aspirations to hit the U.S., you will be struck. (Applause.)\nAnother element of the debate is that John Kerry spends a lot of time running around saying, well -- well, he's said several different things. (Laughter.) But most recently that -- he now decides that the vote that he cast to go to war probably was the right vote after all, but he would have done it differently, that we should have done more to seek allies, to get the approval of the United Nations and so forth. Well, remember what we did do -- we had 30 nations fighting alongside us in Iraq. It's not as though we didn't go with our allies, we did. We also went to the United Nations and said, look, Saddam Hussein has been jerking the U.N. around for 12 years, consistently violating U.N. Security Council resolutions, we need to hold him accountable -- got a unanimous resolution out of the Security Council. But we refused to be blocked when push came to shove and we had to make a decision.\nIn other words, this President made a basic fundamental decision that he's not going to seek a permission slip from anybody when the question is whether or not you defend the nation. (Applause.) Now, George Bush believes that with every fiber of his being. You do everything you can to organize allies, and we've done that -- and to be actively and aggressively involved, using all the international mechanisms that are out there. But in the final analysis, the President of the United States is the one who has to make those tough calls, who has to make those life-and-death decisions for all the rest of us. That's why he gets paid the big bucks and lives in that fancy house in Washington. (Laughter.) Very, very, very important responsibility -- and we don't want to turn that responsibility over to somebody who doesn't have deeply held convictions about right and wrong. (Applause.)\nAnd I must say I look at the record of our opponents, we can talk about that more if anybody is interested, but there's a lot of hesitation and uncertainty. John Kerry is a man who voted against the resolution to use force back in 1991, when the issue was whether or not we'd kick the Iraqis out of Kuwait. He voted no on that. This time around, of course, he voted for committing the troops, and using the force, and then a few months later, when the question was the $87 billion that they needed once they were in the field, in order to buy a lot of the equipment and ammunition, spare parts and so forth, he voted no. And there were only four members of the United States Senate who voted to commit the force and then voted against supporting the force once they were there -- two of those four members were John Kerry and John Edwards. I don't think that's an acceptable pattern of behavior, in my view, for someone who would be President of the United States. I think that it's fundamentally wrong to vote to commit the force and then not give them the resources they need once they're in combat. (Applause.)\nFinally, what we need is somebody who's got absolute steady character, who understands the big picture and is willing to make those tough decisions when they have to be made. We need somebody who will support the troops 100 percent, and that's exactly what we've got in George Bush. (Applause.)\nSo with that, why don't I stop and say we'd be happy to entertain some questions. We got some people in the audience with microphones. And if you raise your hand, they'll come by and give you a mike so we can respond to your concerns or comments, or advice. I can take it right to the top. (Laughter.) So we have somebody over here?\nQ Can you hear me?\nMRS. CHENEY: Yes.\nQ Welcome back to Joplin. Hope you come back again before November and bring W with you. (Applause.)\nEveryone is concerned about the war in Iraq, and Afghanistan, et cetera, so I'm going to kind of ask you a different question concerning education, which is also an issue with the President and you. About the voucher program, why are so many people apparently against this idea?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm going to throw this to Lynne in a second here because she's the education expert in our family. She's spent a lot of time on the subject. I think a lot of people are concerned about it because it does represent fundamental change. And with respect to how we proceed in terms of trying to reform our educational system, the President believed very deeply when he arrived in Washington that he wanted to push education as his number one priority. And he did. That was the first legislation that we introduced. It became the No Child Left Behind Act. The idea that we would establish standards and measure results and accountability in our school systems so that we could hold, in effect, our public school systems accountable for their performance, and the people in them.\nThe debate over vouchers has been going on for a long time. I can remember being involved back in the Nixon administration with experimental programs that were set up in Kansas City, I believe, and some other place in the Midwest where we actually tested that. What I find is the people that object to that, oftentimes are concerned about the degree of change that that might, in fact, entail for the powers that be, if you will, in our school systems. And, frankly, I think change is needed.\nNow, we haven't taken a position on the voucher issue, per se, yet. What we've done is push very hard on this whole nation of establishing a basis upon which we can measure results.\nLet me ask Lynne to respond further.\nMRS. CHENEY: No, I think your analysis is exactly right. The argument I would pose to those people, though, who are threatened by the idea of change -- the question I would pose is, should any child be forced to stay in a failing school? And the answer is no. No child should have to stay in a failing school.\nAnd one of the things that No Child Left Behind does is if a school doesn't improve, the school can't improve, then kids have an opportunity -- parents have an opportunity to send their children to a higher achieving public school.\nDick and I supported private choice for a long time. Because we haven't been able to make public policy out of it, a number of people support programs that do provide kids who don't have a lot of resources the opportunity to attend a private school. I also -- just one other idea, the people you talk to who are opposing the idea of choice, I would suggest this scenario, really, that it doesn't threaten the public schools when a child leaves to go to another school, it provides that school an impetus to improve, a reason to improve. What we know about life is that businesses get better when there's competition. We know about life that all sorts of projects get better if there's some competition -- and that when there's only the status quo, there's not that little engine of improvement. So I would argue that choice really gives our public schools the kind of motive to improve that's really valuable. So it's a terrific idea. The President has gone some way forward in No Child Left Behind by making public school choice possible.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Somebody -- where are the proctors? Here, you got somebody right down here with a mike?\nQ Mr. Vice President, to change the subject a bit, my husband and I are farmers. And we are not rich farmers, but we own an old family farm that's been around since 1919. We'd like to pass it on to our grandchildren, but we don't want them to have to sell part of that farm in order to pay the estate taxes. What's going to be around to help us when the current law sunsets in 2010?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we made progress in the first tax bill. We've changed the tax code, or made changes in the tax code three different times, in '01, '02, and '03, while the President has been there. And one of the big things we went after was the death tax. We just think it's fundamentally unfair, somebody works all their lives, pays tax on what they earn all their lives, puts it into a farm, or a small business, or a ranch, and then at death, the whole thing gets taxed all over again before somebody passes it on to the next generation. We just think that's wrong, fundamentally unfair. (Applause.)\nSo what we did in that first tax bill, we made a number of changes -- this was one of them -- was to phase out the so-called, we call it the death tax. Technically, it's inheritance tax. I think of it as the death tax -- to phase it out over time. But the way the Senate rules are written, when you do that, the provisions are sunset. That is the provisions you adopt as part of an annual budget resolution and tax that goes with that, 10 years down the road then you revert to whatever law was there. So there's a problem, with respect, for example, to the increase in the child tax credit, which we doubled; with relief, marriage penalty relief; with the 10 percent bracket that we set up this time around. A lot of the changes we made in the tax code are scheduled to phase out and revert to those earlier levels over the course of the next few years. And the Death Tax is one of those that's affected like that. The key to solving that problem is to make the Bush tax cuts permanent. That's the right answer. (Applause.)\nAnd we can do that, but our opponents won't. In effect, what they've said is they want to repeal immediately some of those tax cuts that we've already put through. John Kerry said he wants to change a lot of that within the first hundred days he's in office. And as I say, we think that's wrong. I've got great sympathy for you in terms of what happens to a family farm or a small business as a result of getting to that point where the heirs end up having to sell it off in order to pay the taxes on it. It's a lousy deal, and we've got a fix in. But we've got to drive through now to the finish line and make it permanent, not just temporary. Thank you. (Applause.)\nSomebody over here.\nQ Mr. Vice President, could you please comment on what the administration might do in the next term to reduce our dependence on foreign oil?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I would be happy to talk about energy policy. (Laughter.) It's a source of great frustration for us. The fact is the United States is a growing economy. We've got steadily increasing demand for more energy in order to fuel our economy. We're more efficient about how we use it now than we were 20 years ago. We're about -- we produce twice as much output for, say, a gallon of gas as we did previously. But the fact of the matter is, we're still subject to the international marketplace because we import over half of the oil that we use in this country. And we badly need, as well, to develop more resources. We need to invest in new technologies. We need to look for ways to take advantage of the research, a lot of the research that's been done, more that can be done to take advantage of our basic sources that we've got here at home.\nWe've got an energy bill that we did, in fact -- we passed through the House about three times now. We got it through the Senate in the last session of Congress, then we went to conference, we got a conference report approved -- that is the compromise between the versions that went through the House and the Senate, took it back, passed the conference report through the House. We took it to the Senate and we failed by two votes because the Democrats filibustered it. So instead of needing 51 votes to get it through, we needed 60 votes, and we only had 58. We needed two more votes -- John Kerry and John Edwards, guess where they were? They weren't even there. (Laughter.) And they were opposed to it. So we've got to find a way -- if we had two more votes, we could do it.\nAmong other things, for example, it provides significant opportunity for us to get heavily involved in ethanol and biodiesel, use some of our renewable fuels. We've got fantastic ability to produce that stuff in the United States. It's another way to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. And so there are a lot of good ideas out there, but we need to keep pushing hard to get energy legislation approved. And it will be one of our top priorities in the next session.\nYes, back here.\nQ Senator Kerry seems to like to talk about his war record and his things that he would change, although he won't tell what he will change. But I would like to know when and how we will hear more detail about his Senate record so we can get to better know the real Kerry.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, you've come to the right place. (Laughter and applause.)\nIf you look at the convention that they ran in Boston -- I think somebody the other day called it the \"Re-invention Convention,\" there was a heavy focus on Kerry's early years. And anybody who served -- any Vietnam vet deserves our respect. Anybody who has ever been a veteran and served in the military, we have the highest regard for that service. I don't want anybody to think to the contrary. But they left out the next 20 years during his time in the United States Senate.\nAnd I'll give you one example. He has taken to spending a lot of time talking about, and pushing very aggressively on reform of the intelligence community. Now, if he's President, by golly, he's going to fix the intelligence community. He's going to aggressively get after it. He went out and grabbed the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and full speed ahead, this is what I'm going to as President.\nBut if you look at his record, when he served on the intelligence committee, back in the '90s, a couple of things stand out. First of all, he missed 39 out of 48 of the meetings -- had 48 major public hearings during that period of time of with the Senate intel committee, he didn't even show up for 39. He did introduce legislation that in 1993 would have dramatically cut the intelligence budget by over $7 billion -- this is after the first attack on the World Trade Center. It was so far out that even Ted Kennedy voted against it. (Laughter.) So the fact of the matter is, if you look at John Kerry's record in the Senate -- he's certainly entitled to his view. He can vote any way he wanted. But he's trying very hard now to make sure nobody looks very close at how he spent those 20 years because there were 350 occasions when voted either against tax reduction, or for tax increases. I think he voted for the upper option always, when it came time on the question of taxation. Three hundred and fifty times -- that's one vote for higher taxes every three weeks for 20 years. That's the record. And as somebody said the other day, at least the folks back home knew he was on the job. (Laughter.)\nThat might have been a perfectly legitimate way to represent his constituents in Massachusetts. They reelected him a couple of times. But now you cannot expect -- I don't think -- that having laid out that kind of record, having opposed, for example, most of the measures that Ronald Reagan recommended and put in place that led us to the military build-up that made it possible for us to win the Cold War -- a guy who supported the nuclear freeze, a guy who voted against most of the major weapons systems back in the 1980s -- cannot now portray himself as some sort of tough, aggressive, pro-defense, strong on intelligence, this is the guy we want to have lead us in the war on terror. It just doesn't add up.\nAnd what the convention, I thought, in Boston was all about was trying to take his service in Vietnam, together with his comments, his public comments since he became a candidate and use all of that to portray himself as somebody who is capable of being Commander-in-Chief at a very difficult time, when we're engaged with a very shrewd and a very deadly enemy, and ignore those 20 years he spent in the Senate when nearly every time an issue came up that might have some bearing on that capability, he went the wrong way.\nYes, wherever the mikes are around here. You got somebody with a microphone here?\nMRS. CHENEY: The front row has --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: We got people down in the front row with questions.\nQ Thank you. During your second administration as Vice President, what are we going to do about judicial appointments on the federal bench? I know we've got a number that are open now, and how can we close that gap and get some people back to work as federal judges?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, that's been one of the more frustrating developments. This is the first time in our history where we've had an aggressive posture by one of the parties in the Senate of filibustering judicial nominations. That hasn't been done before. They come up on a different calendar. They have an up-or-down -- sooner or later you get a up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate. And a majority vote was always enough to confirm somebody. The Democrats have taken a very different tack these last two years, since we took back the Senate, and it has created major problems for us. We've got some very able, talented judges -- people who would make great judges -- who have not been allowed to even have a vote. Filibuster, in effect, blocks it.\nOne comes immediately to mind, we had four nominees just in the last couple of weeks come up. One of them is a good friend of mine, a guy named Bill Myers, from Idaho. But he used to work for a member of the Wyoming delegation. He actually married a woman who used to work on my congressional staff, so I know him well. He's got great support. He's got bipartisan support. He's got probably 55, 56 votes in the Senate for him, great experience, solicitor various places and so forth. He was nominated for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. That's the Western circuit. That's got all those Western states on it. It is the most frequently reversed circuit in the entire United States. It's the one, by the way, that decided here last year that we shouldn't be allowed to say \"under God\" when we say the Pledge of Allegiance, okay? That's how far out the court is. They have filibustered Bill to the point so that they won't even allow a vote on him on the floor. And it sounds to me like that circuit could use some new judges. (Applause.) That's one of the best arguments I can think about why it's so important to reelect a guy like Kit Bond who is in there fighting every day for the right -- (Applause.)\nQ Yes, I have a question for Mrs. Cheney.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Good. (Laughter.)\nQ Senator Kerry has made the statement that he would like to fight a more sensitive war on terror. What in the world he be thinking about there? What's your thoughts?\nMRS. CHENEY: I just kind of shook my head when I heard that. With all due respect to the Senator, it just sounded so foolish. I can't imagine that al Qaeda is going to be impressed by sensitivity. (Laughter.)\nBut it did remind me of kind of this -- we've heard for a long time from the extreme left in this country, whenever it comes to a matter of our national interest, that somehow the problem is not with the people who are attacking us, the problem is with us. You've heard that. And it struck me as a kind of expression of that idea -- somehow the problem is not with the people who are attacking us, the problem is with us. If we'll just adjust our attitude seems to be the idea. We just do a little mental adjustment here, things will go well. Well, I think it just fits with what Dick is saying. This is kind of left-wing foolishness that certainly isn't appropriate for someone who would seek to be Commander-in-Chief. (Applause.)\nQ Welcome to Missouri. I'm curious what legislation and role you feel the government will play as the gap between church and state continues to expand, specifically when it comes to implementing moral and ethical responsibility, specifically in business? How do you feel the government should react?\nMRS. CHENEY: I think there has to be always in our country a great separation between church and state. One of the gifts of the founders, Jefferson and Madison, in particular, was that separation. But separation of church and state doesn't mean driving the churches out of the public square. (Applause.) And I think that's one of the reasons it's so important that the President has taken the initiative to be sure that faith-based organizations aren't discriminated against. They ought to have resources made available to them to help with their good works.\nAs someone who is interested in education, it has always seemed really important to me, too, that we keep the history of religion in our schools. That's not the same as teaching kids what they should believe. But it is the same as teaching kids that the founders of this country really believed that Providence was watching over us, that Providence helped guide us through the Revolutionary War, that Providence brought us to these shores. And our kids should understand that. They should understand the central place that God held in this country in the beginning, and holds in the lives of so many Americans now. (Applause.)\nQ Mr. Vice President, I have a 2000 Bush-Cheney sticker. I've recycled it today. I want to see our President and Vice President recycled.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you -- I don't want to be recycled. (Laughter.) I want to be reelected. (Laughter.)\nQ But my question is, in view of the corruption in the United Nations, in general, in the Oil for Food, in particularly, when are we going to tell the United Nations to clean their house up before they look into ours? (Applause.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: The investigations that are now under way on the Oil for Food program, I think, are going to turn up some pretty remarkable results. What it looks like is the program that was set up supposedly to provide relief, medical help and basic food stuff for the Iraqi people, was, in fact, converted to a corrupt system that generated enormous profits for Saddam Hussein himself, as well as for some people outside who were participating in that program.\nA man named Paul Volcker, who some of you may remember used to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, at one point. I can remember him when he was, I believe, deputy Treasury secretary -- a very able and talented man is now in charge of the investigation to dig into the bottom of that. And I know him well enough to have great confidence that I think he will, in fact, do exactly that. It's something we need to watch very carefully and make certain that there is a full and complete airing there because it was -- I think it has been a shameful episode in the history of the United Nations. And it's important to clean it up if they're going to continue to want to play a central with respect to the United States, or any other nation that it plays in the world. So it's one to watch, and to continue to push very aggressively on.\nBack here. I feel like we've short-changed the folks on this side.\nQ Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your service to our country. The economic recovery has generally been very strong. We seem to have hit a little bit of a soft patch with the last jobs report, gas prices remain kind of high. I kind of like to know what you all's impression is for the economy, not just between now and the election, but what you're looking to do in your second term to keep things going.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, in terms of looking at the economy and where we are with respect to the overall performance, we feel pretty good about things. When we were sworn in, we were already headed towards the recession, then of course the attack of 9/11 really shook the economy once again. And a couple of things happened, the President pushed very aggressively on the tax program, aimed specifically at changing that. We concluded that the best way that we could respond to the recession was to leave more money in the hands of the people that earned it, that American people could spend it better and more wisely than government will. (Applause.)\nAnd I think that's worked. I think we've seen in terms of real growth now, we've been growing at about 4.5 percent, a little less than 5 percent over the last year in terms of real GDP, real gross domestic product. That's one of the best rates of growth in the last 20 years. We've added about 1.5 million new jobs on the payroll survey since last August.\nOne of the things to watch here -- it has been a technical complexity that's added to it. There are really two ways to measure unemployment. And we collect two sets of data. The number you referred to, the so-called payroll system, we go out to companies, and we ask them how many people they've got employed. And they tell us, and then we add that up, and that gives you your monthly unemployment. That's what usually gets pegged. And that's the one that in the last month was 32,000 in July.\nThere's another survey where we don't go to the businesses, we go to households. And we ask in households how many people are employed. It's a different approach. And the latter survey captures a lot more than does the former, and always leads it. And for example, that month of July when the payroll surveys showed 32,000 jobs added, the household survey showed over 600,000 because it picks up the extent to which people are self-employed. Lynne, for example, does very well in terms of her own professional career and line of work, but she doesn't work for anybody. And there's no way out there to measure her employment, except through the household survey. If you're in business for yourself, if you've got your own small business and so forth, you don't get picked up by those other numbers. And there's a lag there. And right now, there's a big gap between the household survey, which shows very significant improvements, and the payroll survey which has slowed down a big.\nBut all of the forecasts we see show that we can plan on sustained growth going forward, that we've made major progress over the course of the last year or so, and that there's every reason to believe it will continue, that the rate of growth will be on the order of 3 to 4 percent next year, and that we'll continue to do everything we can, especially focusing on tax policy. We think the heart of what we've been able to do is tax policy. We want to make those tax cuts permanent. That will be right at the top of our agenda going forward, as well as deal with a number of other issues out there. Medical liability reform is a big issue. We can find ways to make more health care available to more people at lower cost, and to deal with lawsuit abuse. We think there are significant problems in the litigation area. We need a good energy policy in place because energy is a very important component part of our economy, and we cannot have economic success if we can't have adequate supplies of energy at reasonable prices that people can afford to pay. (Applause.)\nQ Mr. Vice President, I had a question back on terrorism. How can America be expected to defeat terrorism when we have to fight based on a set of rules and the terrorists don't?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, a set of rules -- maybe you can clarify that.\nQ From hiding in mosques -- we can't really attacks mosques, to even from door-to-door, things we do over here with the ACLU and that kind of thing on civil rights?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, that's an interesting question because we do want to take whatever steps are necessary to be able to defeat the terrorists. We've done such things, for example, as enact the Patriot Act, which allows us to do a more effective job of going after, investigating, and prosecuting terrorists. But basically, what we did there wasn't to invent new legal tools, so much as take ones that were already being used, for example, against drug traffickers, and apply those over in the terrorism field. And we need to take extraordinary steps to do everything we can to defend the country. I think we've done that to a large extent in creating the Department of Homeland Security. So we've done a lot of that.\nThe cautionary note is there's a line out there someplace that it's hard to define, but it is a line you don't want to cross over that would, in effect, where the government would become so onerous, so heavy handed, would intrude so deeply in the lives of all of us, that the terrorists would win without ever firing a shot. You don't want that to happen either. So it calls for real judgment and balance. I think it's important for us as we fight terror also to do as the oath of office the President and I took when we were sworn in, support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So you got to find your way forward here to marshal the resources and defend the nation to take those steps necessary to defeat the terrorists, but at the same time not sort of lock down the country so tight that we fundamentally change our way of life, which is, after all, one of the objectives of the terrorists. We don't want that to happen either. And I think we can do it. I'm an optimist about it. That doesn't mean that there won't be tough days ahead. I think there will be. That doesn't mean there won't be more attacks on the United States. We know they're out there trying to get at us. It doesn't mean we won't have to be committed with troops overseas, or that we won't take casualties.\nBut when I think about the obstacles and the challenges we've overcome through our history, I think back to World War II, and what we did as a nation. There's some people in the audience here today who probably served, and certainly remember it, when we could marshal the resources as a nation, and motivate the country and take on the challenges of defeating the Nazis and the Japanese, and do it as effectively as we did, there's every reason to be optimistic here, as well, too. I think the fundamental strength of this nation, our basic values, the principles we live by, the strength of our institutions, the tremendous capabilities of the United States military, the fact that we've got so many folks out there who are willing to step up and take on major responsibilities both here at home and overseas, all of those things give me cause for hope and optimism that this is a battle we can win. (Applause.)\nQ Welcome to Missouri. And I thank you for your time. My question is, come November 3rd, and I'm going to be an optimist right along with you, come November 3rd and for the next four years, what is your plan on stem cell research and for the sanctity of life?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we will continue -- I think the President has got a policy on stem cell research that he devoted an enormous amount of time to. This is a subject he really grappled with, consulted with experts on all sides of the issue to arrive at the policy that's now in place. We think it is a sound one, both from the standpoint of medical science, as well as from the standpoint of moral values. The President believes very deeply that we stand for a culture of life. He was very proud to sign, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion -- thought that was a very important piece of legislation. (Applause.) So I don't think there should be any doubt in anybody's mind about where he's headed with respect to those kinds of issues. He's been rock solid on it.\nOkay, we got somebody. Go ahead.\nQ Mr. Vice President, I just want to let you know that fellow Missourians are praying for the election. And we know who is in control. And just let Brother Ashcroft know that his fellow Missourians are praying with you guys.\nAnd my question is, we're owner-operators. And this is a heavily trucking industry area, and the fuel obviously is going to be -- is a stretch for us. Is there any hope? What can we look forward to as far as the prices coming down on that?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, the things we need to try to do -- in addition to try to produce more here at home. We've got problems with our refinery capacity. We're running flat out on our refineries. One of the things we recommended when the President got me involved early on in terms of putting together an energy policy was to modify our new source review regulations over at the Environmental Protection Agency so that it would be easier to expand existing refineries.\nWe're in a situation today where you look at basic fuels, we've got some 51 different blends that are required various places around the country because of our local air quality requirements. So what you do for St. Louis is different than what you do for Kansas City, is different than Chicago, different than Denver. And as I say, we got some 51 different blends that have to be manufactured. We haven't built a new refinery in this country in many, many a year because it's so hard to get it permitted. And so again, we're right up against the limits there in terms of the amount of refined product that's available especially for our transportation sector.\nWe will continue to push on the new source review idea. We got the change made in the regulations now. It's tied up in court. Some groups who didn't want us to make the change we wanted to make have taken it to court. And that should get resolved within the next -- hopefully within the next few months. And that may help some. But it's going to be a continuing problem for us until we find ways to get more product into the U.S. economy to meet those requirements at a reasonable price. And I know when you start to pay -- I can't imagine what it is to fill up one of those big rigs, but it's got to be a lot. And it's affecting everybody.\nMRS. CHENEY: Dick, I just got a signal, we can only have one more question.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: All right, you get to answer it. (Laughter.)\nMRS. CHENEY: I like this lady in the cute, colored sweater. (Laughter.)\nQ (Inaudible).\nMRS. CHENEY: Do I still have the red dress? (Laughter.) Oh, my, no, but do I wish I did. (Laughter and applause.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: We want to thank all of you for being here this morning. We really appreciate your turning out and taking the time to come spend a few moments with us. Again, as I say, this is an extraordinarily important election. We're going to make some decisions here that our kids and grandkids are going to live with, and very important that we get it right. I think it takes on the kind of significance, if you will, the kinds of decisions we had to make after World War II, as we got into the Cold War, and we had to create a Defense Department, and NATO, and when we first created the CIA -- a whole series of fundamental decisions that were made and then were pursued by successive administrations because it was a vital part of our security, and it worked. In the final analysis, we prevailed in the Cold War, and the Soviet Union is no more. As I say, and I'm an optimist, there's no reason in the world why with the right kind of leadership and the right kind of commitment and dedication from the American people we cannot, indeed, prevail in this conflict just as we have in every other.\nSo thank you very much for being here. (Applause.)\nEND 1:25 P.M. CDT\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Diving into energy demand and a deep look at India for American interests - Jordan Fife\nJordan Fife just returned from another visit to what could be one of the next big trading partners of U.S. farmers and ranchers. India has the world's largest population and a desire for more commodities and insight. We also talk about energy stories around the world with the president of trading for Biourja.\nTranscript\nHey everybody. I'm Paul Yeager This is the MToM Show podcast to production of Iowa PBS and the Market to Market TV show. Today, we are going to get into a topic that has been coming up more and more during our Market Analysis segment as well as Market Plus, it is about the country of India. Is it an emerging market? Is it a market that the United States can count on to ship Great? Well, we'll ask a person who was just there. And his business is trading seems like a perfect combo and also seems like a good time to bring back one of our guests. That's Jordan, Fife. He's based in the Houston Texas area, he just went to Houston, or he went from Houston to India, and we learn a little bit about that trip. But Jordan is the president of trading for Biourja, which is a company that's actually owned by a group in India. So we'll find out about those relationships, and what he has discovered from a set of American eyes when he is there. So that is our topic today. We hope you enjoy this episode, like all the others that comes out on Tuesday. You're an interesting follow on X or Twitter, whatever you want to say, you're in a very tech industry, but you also have some old school charts. I love looking at numbers. You've been in the energy, you're in the energy business, but there's been some energy charts that have caught your attention recently. What are they?\nJordan Fife: Yeah. Thanks for having me, Paul. Appreciate it. One of the things that I like to do is go back in time and look at world events that are similar to the current events that are happening. And obviously, the big one that is shaping energy right now is the conflict in Israel. What does it mean? If we look back? And how do we extrapolate that in the future, and the two most similar conflicts that we've faced in recent times are the first Iraq war and the second Iraq War? If you look back on the first Iraq war, which was in 1990, we had an increase from $17 to $40. And some of that was almost overnight, it happened very quickly. The second Iraq war in 2003, and 2004, it happened on a longer timeframe to increase, but we had a 63% increase in oil. So you look at that and say, what's it mean for us? Now, we're sitting at about $81 per barrel of oil. So if you increase between 43 and or 63%, you're looking at like $133- $130 per barrel of oil. And then what does that mean? On the street, to the people who are buying gasoline at the pump, it means like a $4 Something handle, depending on which state you're in, and how the taxes work, and everything like that, which would obviously be bad for the economy, which would be bad for all things considered for the United States. So we're trying to figure out how big is this conflict going to get? What is its reach? And that is what I think most energy traders are focused on right now.\n[Yeager] One of the big firms not an energy firm, but a trading firm right after the invasion, or the bombing started, was oil is going to go well over 100, in just a short amount of time, didn't happen. Do we have a different world supply than say we did in 1990, 91, then 2003-2004, then what we have in 2023. And that's maybe why the market didn't respond as violently?\n[Fife] So specifically, if you look at the United States, right, there's two different oil indices that most people follow. There's WTI. And there's Brent, West Texas, intermediate, and Brent, which is off the North Shore of Scotland. And those two can react differently, depending on what the world events are. But we're gonna focus real quick on WTI, West Texas Intermediate, back in 1990, and everything like that we were importing 24 25% of our oil from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela, you know, countries like that fast forward to currently, and the United States is the largest oil producer in the world. That's a fact that just gets lost on people for some reason to one that the United States doesn't do a great job. And I'm not going to if you follow me on Twitter, or X, or whatever you call it, I don't like to get into politics, I really don't. But if you're a Republican, you don't want to say that we're the number one producer of oil, because that means that you know, we've done a good job of producing, they like to say drill, baby drill. If you're liberal, you don't like to say we're the world's largest producer of oil, because it's a bad thing because we're, we're digging in the ground, and we're doing all this bad stuff to the environment. So both sides, the United States really doesn't toot their own horn. So that is one of the major differences between back then. And now we are the number one oil producer on top of that, as I previously mentioned, we were importing 24, 25% from Saudi Arabia, another 15-20% from Venezuela. We don't do that anymore. The number we import from Canada, number one is 60%. And then another 10%. From what countries we import from is Mexico. So 70% of our income words are coming from neighboring countries that we're extremely friendly with. So the WTI portion of the oil equation is vastly different. And then on a world front again, you're going to get into different flows and everything like that pipelines, how they've been built, treaties that have been signed, it's just a very different world. However, Brent will be more affected, Europe will be more affected, Asia will be more affected by these wars, in the very short term, overall, the rising tide will lift both boats, the spread between WTI. And Brent can only get so wide. But I think that's probably in the short term, what's going to happen more as the brick will rise more and relative than the WTI.\n[Yeager] I also think of WTI of the challenges of finding new sources in the United States, that has, we've looked at North Dakota and in the Bakken region. And I'm not saying it's empty, but it's less than an influence that it once was. And then you have energy policies from the White House right now that are on the green front. But as you said, we're getting a lot of oil into this country. And we're also with trading partners, a lot gets talked about on this program about China. But it's really, it's really the North American countries that we trade and do a lot of business with, you're really close to Mexico, where you're at closer than I am, I'm closer to Canada than you are our relations, the same when it comes to oil when it does two commodities, like beef cattle, and corn and soybeans.\n[Fife] Yeah, I mean, there's obviously some pretty big differences there. When you do deal with oil, but the oil sands out of Canada are that we need us as a buyer, we need them as a supplier, it is a very symbiotic relationship. There it differs slightly, and I don't need to tell you or a lot of people in your audience, how that differs for commodities, like soybeans, or corn or anything like that. I mean, we have South America sitting just to the southwest, right, and they are a constant presence and just producing more and more agricultural products every single year. They're in their growth phase. And they're looking for a home and one of them is North America, and our trading partners, which you know, is Canada and Mexico. So it's more of an intrusive from the agricultural standpoint coming in from the south. Whereas there the supplier, Mexico and Canada to the United States. And we're the buyer, and we hold a lot of cards. Also the dollar is the driver of this oil trades and the dollar, which helps us a lot in a lot of scenarios. So it is different in that they need to sell to us.\n[Yeager] Your bosses aren't going to hear this. Have we hit peak oil in the United States? Our conception of it, our consumption?\n[Fife] If not, we're within you know, an earshot of it. And but that's not really that big of a deal. I really don't think it is you don't we're not going to go no, I don't, I don't because I mean electrical wise, it's not going to make sense to go all electrical for while I am in Texas, as you noted, as you guys remember, we all froze a couple years ago and our grid went under, we are an independent grid, the Texas grid is completely independent of the United States, which is a unique thing unto itself. But if you use that as an example, our infrastructure has to be massively increased to to increase electric vehicles to a point of which it's over 10% 15% the numbers just aren't there. You know, I had one friend of mine that worked at a gasoline car, he doesn't work at a gasoline station, but he worked for a large gasoline station company. And he told me that one of the Porsches, the electric, all electric Porsches, if you come in peak hours to fill that thing up from zero, it takes more electricity to fill that thing up from zero to full than it does to generate all of the power and to put the entire gas station. That's all the pumps, all the refrigeration, all the air conditioning, every other thing that powers this massive gasoline station, that one Porsche will draw more energy off of the grid. So that really doesn't bother me that much. As far as peak oil consumption goes, our cars are getting more efficient. There are hybrids out there, I honestly think the hybrid model is probably better than the all electric and the internal combustion engine will not cease to exist in North America within the next, you know, within our lifetime. But when I look at Asia, and I look at India, and I look at those places, India has 1.4 billion people, the point four is larger than the entire United States. And they're industrializing at a rapid rate. There's going to be a home for hydrocarbons that come out of a refinery. So what that means, really, in my opinion, and it's already happening, but I think it's going to increase the United States will be further and further into exporting hydrocarbons, whether that's diesel or gasoline to the rest of the world. We have an extremely efficient refining capacity and system down in the Gulf of Mexico, all the way from Louisiana all the way over to Texas. And it's set up to do that. And again, I've imported and export Get it out of South America, it's just easier to do it out of North America out of out of the Gulf of Mexico.\n[Yeager] We, though, haven't built a new refinery in the United States and decades, and are there any new ones coming online? Or are we just getting more efficient? Operations?\n[Fife] I think it's the latter. And, you know, I've heard that obviously, we've all heard that we haven't built a refinery and X, Y, and Z. And it's true. But we've retrofitted a ton. We've put new hydro-treators, hydrocracker hydro crackers, in a lot of places, and we continually have to keep up and improve the efficiency of these refineries. That being said, eventually, you're going to have to rebuild some of these. I don't know when that will be, I don't know. It's going to be very hard, whatever administrations and I mean, even if you know, more, right, leaning, easier to get things done in the Gulf of Mexico type of politicians, even then there's going to be somebody that holds out for something. It's just hard to do right now.\n[Yeager] It's like a beef processing or a hog processing plant. Nobody wants it in their backyard, even though it might be needed for more stability. Ethanol wise, where do you see that fuel fitting in, in this discussion of what you're talking about globally? And domestically?\n[Fife] So that's a big question right now. And one that depending on who you ask, it's either really good or really bad, right? I tend to lean to really good. And the reason why is because of what we're seeing in the renewable diesel space. We're seeing all this investment all these back to hydro cheaters either crackers, you've seen all these major oil refiners getting into the space of renewables, which is encouraging us to feel like they're kind of the foe, even though they're the biggest. Their biggest customer of renewables was the big oil companies, they kind of seem to infer for the right reason, you know, that you walk in and someone says 10% of your demand is gone, and it's going to go to this new product. Understandably, they're going to want to try to fight for that 10%. But now they're kind of rowing the boat in the same direction with this renewable diesel. They're buying soybean oil, they're buying fats, they're getting Talos. They're getting the oil there. There's corn oil, they're getting into the space of renewables. What does that mean for ethanol? Sustainable aviation fuel is the next logical leap and sustainable aviation fuel right now, there is a push to use ethanol as a feedstock for sustainable aviation. If that were to pass, we're off to the races. This is a whole new market to tap into, which would really help ethanol.\n[Yeager] And that's what I've heard, both said on our show by different folks who have come in from the Ag side commodity side who see that as a possibility, also the administration, Secretary Vilsack has made a big push in 2023, about sustainable aviation fuel.\n[Fife] We're still you look there, Biden's they have committed to it. Yeah, there you go. Look, Southwest Delta, they've all signed things by blank, we're going to have X amount in our and there's only one way to do that. It's policy. And it's working with people. And it's guaranteeing that in these emerging markets in these small study startups, not rather small, quite large, that there will be a need for it next year, you can't put all your money in and expect to get it back in one year. It takes years to recover these billions and billions of dollars that they're going to be putting in. So you need an administration, whoever it might be, as friendly to that and says, Hey, we're gonna be there for the next couple of years to make sure you guys get it off the ground. No pun intended.\n[Yeager] Either way, it works. pun works, they take off your employer, your checks come, you have a lot in India, you were just in India, I want to talk about that. When you mentioned emerging markets, we always talk about China, where does India fit into this discussion right now?\n[Fife] From an energy standpoint, yes, I was just in India and I did, there are 1.4 billion people there. And I was in Delhi for a moment and just seeing Delhi is like 34 million people. It's incredible. And Mumbai was there for a moment. It's like 35 million people. The state that Delhi is in is over 200 million people. And it's like one and a half times the size of North Carolina. It's not a big place. There's so many people there. So obviously that means if they all start driving, there's huge demand there. They all start eating more protein. So there's huge demand there for agriculture and everything like that, even though a lot of India is vegetarian. There's other ways to get it in there. But they are emerging in a way that I think China has already happened. They're in that first wave of true industrialization over the last 10 years, how much they've invested in infrastructure and highways to link Mumbai and New Delhi and all that. It's truly incredible to see. And then from an ethical standpoint, obviously they only import industrial right now they do not import fuel grade if that were to ever change that is the silver lining to every ethanol producers cloud right now. If India were to step in and say we want more FL It would be a game changer. China used to import more and now they're building their own ethanol plants. Currently, India has ethanol plants, they make it from molasses from sugarcane. But it's just they don't have the infrastructure to do it. They could take more tomorrow. Modi, their Prime Minister has also increased the amount of ethanol they do take into their cars. They're not hitting it right now. But the fact that they're trying to do it is encouraging. So either one of two things is gonna happen, in my opinion, one, they eventually say you can import fuel or two, they say, Hey, could you come help us build these things and show us how to run them? Either way? I think it's going to be good for the US.\n[Yeager] How long have a good for the US? I mean, you talk about a five year a 50 year scenario there.\n[Fife] I don't think India has done growing. So really, the question is, how long will they keep expanding, and I think they'll continue to do that for the next 20. So 20 to 30 years. Now, if they can industrialize that much, and they do grow sugarcane and everything like that, they could potentially start making their own. So it just depends on the industrialization, you're going to need it near their populous areas, you're going to need to build these plants in and around Mumbai, New Delhi, Hyderabad, where there's major metropolitan areas to make a dent, or they need to increase their, their ports cities to take in more and build takes, it'll take some investment from somebody, but somebody's gonna get it right and probably make a ton of money.\n[Yeager] Infrastructure, to me is always one of those big debates and challenges for India, what is it going to take for them to rapidly excel in improving roads, ports, plants, everything that's needed to get to this plan? How quickly and what's their stomach and tolerance for it? I,\n[Fife] From what they have shown in the last 10 years, it seems like they have the stomach for it again, you know, just the vast improvements in India, in the last 10 years, is pretty shocking. And it's kind of rudimentary to you and I, the United States, everything like that. But from where they have come to where they have gone. And again, just the last decade is truly astonishing. And Modi seems to be driving it pretty well right now. I think that they you know if they can get access to cheap money is is no longer I think that's the biggest hindrance right now, if we can get the World Bank's back to a reasonable level, I think what they showed us over the last decade, they'll continue in very, very similar fashion, but more democratic than than China. And again, as an ally, they are a strong one, they are the largest democracy in the world. And that's something that we should be as the United States, no matter who's at office, pushing for this is a huge buyer of things. They're blessed with a lot of things. And India's Modi likes to say resources is not one of them. They need to come from somewhere 80% of their energy is important. Right now that's been filled by Russia and Saudi Arabia. If we can intervene there in the way with hydrocarbons, or whatever it is, that would really go a long way, I think to find that relationship.\n[Yeager] But as an India, just looking for the cheapest option. Forget we all geopolitical well, but we are too but some of those decisions are challenged where like, I don't know if I want to buy from that country.\n[Fife] I mean, if you look at Elon Musk, he's figured it out, right? I mean, where's mining for all this stuff come from? He lets another intermediary get in there. And then he buys it from them. And it doesn't look like he's doing it. There's ways around it. I mean, water always finds its level, right? And if somebody is willing to wear the risk for you, you have to pay him for it. But at the end of the day, yes, India has decided to buy the cheapest, and he can't blame. I mean, they, they have an opportunity here to increase their margins to shorten the gap a little bit. I mean, they took it and there's no laws against it. There's been talk of embargoes and everything like that, but you don't want to make a tense relationship with somebody when you're trying to get these relationships off the ground. So I think there's still a way in there. But yes, until there's, there's until we run out of cheap Russian oil, they're probably gonna keep taking there's no way around that.\n[Yeager] So it becomes a competition just like we always hear in grains, whoever's the cheapest is going to get the business. He is going to abide by that rule. So in that sense, they are like the United States. Yeah. Sorry, geopolitical wise. What? America is not the only one that knows what's going on there and can look at the numbers of India. So what are you hearing about Russia's interest in maybe their ways in India or China and their ways in India and if we fund bankroll some of these things, where's Modi have to sit? Where do the people have to sit in that country to understand who's influencing and trying to influence decisions?\n[Fife] Wow, that's, a great question. You know, Modi, has met with, I think both Donald Trump and you Joe Biden now I know he met with Trump, Trump went over there and Modi came over here. I don't know, if Biden has met with him yet. Definitely needs to have, he hasn't. But again, their democracy at the end of the day, and they are a very active democracy, like their voting turnout is like 98%. It's incredible. I don't think they're gonna go the way of fascism and dictatorship. And I just don't think that suits them. However, if they're willing to do they have showed that they're willing to do business with those type of countries. And again, they are kind of on an island over there, they're in Asia, you know, a lot of people forget that it's Asia, and Asia is right next to the Middle East, and it's right next to Russia. So that's going to be the cheapest supply. I think they're more opportunistic than they are leaning that way politically. It then becomes the United States job to offer them an alternative that, if it's not cheaper, is palatable. And if we can't do that, well, then I don't expect them to really follow through with any trade with us.\n[Yeager] Do you see India importing more of our goods? Or our insight on goods? You talked about improving refineries, things like that? That's what I mean. Yeah,\n[Fife] I think the insights are probably the easier way and and look, you know, if you look at America right now, the way it's trending tech is kind of one of our biggest exports, right. And that's more idea based than it is goods based, you know, we've kind of shifted a little bit from, from raw materials and everything like that, you know, to a more tech related economy. So I expect that that will continue to follow through. And it's an easier one, right, the goods is a harder one, like we talked about, India doesn't need to improve their ports, they cannot intake and more if there's a bottleneck, so they need to work to the bottle with that, once they do that, I think there's a very good opportunity, again, to have some sort of trade agreement with them. Since they are again in Asia, that 's a natural drawl to China. But China is not really a huge exporter, either, you know, they're, they're a large importer, as well. So it really comes down to Russia and into the Middle East. And that's going to be more oil based to begin with. As far as agricultural products go, I mean, in South America, they're going to try to draw off as much as they can, and then do as much as they can domestically. But I was there, I drove around the country, I went to several farms, they've got a long way to go a very long way to go. I mean, they really are still doing like water buffaloes and plows. That's not facetious at all. That's just the way it is right now in a lot of places over there. candles and flowers, I saw it with my own two eyes, herds of sheep, in the middle of a highway, grieving the middle of it, that they paid them to do. So again, it's got a long way to go. But if there is an alternative, they're very willing to listen to it. It just has to be within their budget.\n[Yeager] Do can their farms catch up rapidly? Do they have enough land that would allow them to maybe do some things internally in their country and not have to rely on imports from other countries importing countries.\n[Fife] They’ve got a lot of land, I drove from New Delhi to Agra, which is where the Taj Mahal is, it's like a three and a half hour drive, there was nothing between it, there was just farmland, that's all of us, you know, for three and a half hour drive, and again, they they have land, once you get further north to get into the the Himalayas, you're not going to grow anything there. But when you get further south, there's plenty of land, however, it then becomes water conservation, and how much they're drawn. 1.4 billion people really do draw a lot of water. And on top of that, they have a pollution problem. They know that they're very aware of the air quality there is poor, but also the water quality. So you have competing factors that you're going to have to mitigate somehow, I'm not sure how, and I'm not an engineer to figure that out. But it's a fact that they're going to have to figure out water, not only quality, but where it's going to go. They do have a monsoon season, and then it kind of dries up. So they will be able to grow maybe right after that. But again, right now, very rural, very rudimentary. I don't think it's going to catch up within the next decade, but maybe in the next 2030 years. Sure.\n[Yeager] As an American, what are my headlines or things and stories I'm supposed to follow out of India to just moving forward?\n[Fife] Where they're getting their energy from who they're signing their treaties with. Our ability to again to to offer them something that makes sense and what are our efforts are, the longer we don't the more somebody else will\n[Yeager] Do you anticipate that we are going to see India emerge from emerging nation status in the next 20 years?\n[Fife] I believe so. Yes. You know, they had the G 20. summit there. They had the world games there. They've had Indian, the IPL the Indian cricket League. Now they've expanded into having the World Cup of cricket there. I think they'll get there. It's going to be difficult. because, again, you know, 33 million people in a city and a fair amount of those and lower quality of life conditions right now. But I think they can do it, you know, just just from the infrastructure that they've shown on the road side, on logistics, it's improved so much in a decade, that I think if you fast forward and getting that base foundation, now you can build up quickly, right, relatively speaking. And I think they've almost gotten that base completed. So now the next pieces need to come into place. A big thing that's happening there is they're not tearing down homes and kicking people out what they do is, as they say, Okay, you're in a, you're in a apartment complex, that's that needs to be redone, refurbished, they pay for you to move, they refurbish it, but then they're able to add like 15 Extra stories on top of the existing building. And those extra 15, they're then allowed to sell the Indian government allows them to do that they have to move everybody back in or they have to at the same rate as they did before. And that's happened in New Delhi and Mumbai. So you're seeing this giant boom. And in building the ability, there's crazy by the way, there's like bamboo scaffolding people are welding and flip flops, no OSHA, just be gone. But they're getting it done quickly. And you're seeing it just everywhere. Real estate and somewhere like Mumbai, which used to be Bombay, is more expensive than New York, because there's just no more of it there in the cities. It's so crammed in. But once you get outside, so rural, and still very village oriented.\n[Yeager] I guess I always look at a little comparison for China. Let's first ask about intellectual property, thoughts. We know the Chinese have a history of reverse engineering, something they may have picked up in the United States and built it for their own? Is that type of mentality? They're in India?\n[Fife] I don't believe so. No, I really don't. It doesn't seem like they are you know, there's still like a big push for a lot of people in India to get to the United States to study here. That seems to be a little bit waning in China. And again, I think they're more democratic. They're more like they want to be a partner. They're very open to some of the nicest people you'll ever meet in your life. Whatever they have, they're willing to share. I went to a festival. It was fantastic. actually made a favor. But I just don't see the same. I don't. I don't even know what to call that from China. But it seems different from India. Yeah. And more accepting of Western culture and more wanting to assimilate, more wanting to partner and that seems to be more their speed.\n[Yeager] So then I'll guess I'll ask on the China we hear about the younger folks are not wanting to live in the country, and they want to live in the cities. Do you have either the same thing happening or the opposite of people getting out of the cities because it's so crowded? In India?\n[Fife] No, it's the young people who are moving to the cities, it feels like there's some split, when I say smaller, I visited a city in Indore, and that's actually where our back office in our accounting is, is. That's the reason for my trip. But it was like a city like two 3 million people, which is still pretty good size. But it was a very young city. And it was very tech related. It was very, it boasts itself as the cleanest city in India. And that city was very young. And I think it's like a more of a mid-sized city kind of like an Austin or Nashville, which seems to be barbarian, United States, a lot of young people moving there. And maybe it's a little more affordable than Mumbai or New Delhi. Much like the United States, it's very hard to move and pick up and go to LA or New York nowadays. It's too expensive. Although Austin and Nashville are rapidly approaching.\n[Yeager] They're doing their part to contribute to the economy. They sure are.\n[Fife] But you're getting like that those smaller mid-sized cities that are attracting but no people definitely are leaving the countryside in droves to go to university, in a place like Indore, or Mumbai and Delhi are still very popular, obviously.\n[Yeager] I guess let's close it up like this. Jordan, as we look at is there any comparison India is to another country? Has there been somebody else that's followed? This template or somebody 50 years ago that Yep, here comes India. This is what happened in that country.\nI will put as the one that I would put it with maybe I completely wrong, but it feels like it is our neighbor in South Mexico. You know, they've really come along. Obviously, you know, if you look at Mexico's refining, you look at their agricultural, you look at their infrastructure, you look at telecommunications, you look at the internet, everything is you know, I don't know the last time you're in Mexico, but if you go to a developed area of Mexico, it very much feels like you're in the United States. If you're in Cabo or Cancun or any of those, you're in the United States with a nice beach, right? Safe of everything like that. It's got its problems, but what country doesn't, but I would say it's like that probably like a 50 year ago, Mexico, where it used to be much more rural and now we're seeing a lot of things validation in Mexico City and all these other cities, Monterey, you're seeing this consolidation and a willingness to work with with with us with the United States. They're obviously one of our largest trade partners. So yeah, I would, I would hope that it goes that route.\n[Yeager] Back to your day job, let's deal with oil and energy. As we look in the new year of 2024, are we going to look at $5 a gallon gas? Are we going to see oil over WTI? Over 100? What's it going to take to get to that point? Or if we kind of stabilized where we're at?\n[Fife] I think it is completely dependent upon what happens in Israel and Gaza. And if it stays within Israel and Gaza, not we've seen what's going to happen, we had a $9 jump, like I said, on the day of the arm, the day of the attack from Hamas to to Israel $9 in one day, and now it's bled over time, it's gone back down. We're basically at the starting point of what we were on that day, which was October 6, back to the start, the World Bank says if there's a medium size, conflict in the Middle East, there'll be about a 35% increase in crude oil. So that means if we get some smaller nations, maybe it's I'm just gonna throw it out there Qatar or something like it probably was that Qatar, but it's more like a Kuwait. If something gets involved there, or Lebanon or something like that, there's a better example, we're going to see a 35% increase, if for any reason, Saudi Arabia, or Iran gets anyway involved in this, you will see $130 crude or something, something to that effect, how long it lasts, I don't know these things usually come off pretty quickly after they, you know, the dust settles. But that's the only way in the new year. Paul, I think you're gonna see anything with the $100 crude on it is if you either get either a smaller country or a larger country back involved, it stays within those borders or trickles out a little bit. You're probably seeing $90.95 tops.\n[Yeager] Jordan Fife, good to see again, thank you for the time.\n[Fife] Oh, anytime. Thanks for having me.\n[Yeager] My thanks to Jordan Fife.

Since then, our democracy has stood strong as Americans have enjoyed liberties unparalleled in the world – including the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. Throughout my time in Congress, I have stood with Kansans in my efforts to protect these valuable freedoms.\nOne significant threat to our Second Amendment freedoms is the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, signed by Secretary of State John Kerry on September 25, 2013. The intent of the treaty is to establish “common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms,” but it fails to exempt civilian firearms from its scope or even recognize the individual right of self-defense. As such, I introduced S. Con. Res. 7 in March 2013, legislation signed by 35 of my Senate colleagues, to make clear any Arms Trade Treaty that infringes upon the Second Amendment rights of Americans is dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate. When the Obama Administration ignored our concerns and signed the treaty in last year, 50 U.S. Senators joined my letter to express our regret and opposition to ratification. For now, our overwhelming bipartisan opposition has deterred the Administration from formally seeking Senate ratification.\nDuring my time in the Senate, I have also introduced legislation to prohibit taxpayer money from being used by the Department of Homeland Security to purchase ammunition without presenting the necessary justification to Congress. Additionally, I have fervently supported legislation to support concealed carry reciprocity – allowing law-abiding citizens to exercise their fundamental right to self-defense while traveling or temporarily living away from home. On March 28, 2013, I signed a letter authored by Senators Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee stating our intent to oppose any legislation that would infringe upon the constitutional right of Americans to bear arms.\nWhile much needs to be done to prevent violent crime in our nation, more restrictions on responsible, law-abiding firearm owners are not the answer. We must redouble our efforts to enforce all existing gun laws, which are extremely effective in protecting law-abiding citizens from each other, and use our legal power to prosecute criminals who misuse firearms to the fullest extent of the law. I will continue to support Second Amendment freedoms and oppose any legislation before Congress that violates our gun rights.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        NOTE: This Constitutional amendment to enshrine common sense gun safety measures is now known as the Right to Safety amendment.\nPrinciples of proposed 28th Amendment broadly supported by the American public and gun owners\nSACRAMENTO – Today Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution to enshrine fundamental, broadly supported gun safety measures into law. While leaving the 2nd Amendment unchanged and respecting America’s gun-owning tradition, the Governor’s proposal guarantees common sense constitutional protections and gun safety measures that Democrats, Republicans, independent voters, and gun owners overwhelmingly support – including universal background checks, raising the firearm purchase age to 21, instituting a firearm purchase waiting period, and barring the civilian purchase of assault weapons.\n“Our ability to make a more perfect union is literally written into the Constitution,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “So today, I’m proposing the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution to do just that. The 28th Amendment will enshrine in the Constitution common sense gun safety measures that Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and gun owners overwhelmingly support – while leaving the 2nd Amendment unchanged and respecting America’s gun-owning tradition.”\nThe 28th Amendment will permanently enshrine four broadly supported gun safety principles into the U.S. Constitution:\n- Raising the federal minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21;\n- Mandating universal background checks to prevent truly dangerous people from purchasing a gun that could be used in a crime;\n- Instituting a reasonable waiting period for all gun purchases; and\n- Barring civilian purchase of assault weapons that serve no other purpose than to kill as many people as possible in a short amount of time – weapons of war our nation’s founders never foresaw.\nAdditionally, the 28th Amendment will affirm Congress, states, and local governments can enact additional common-sense gun safety regulations that save lives.\nPassage of the 28th Amendment will require a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, also known as an Article V Convention or amendatory convention. Working in partnership with members of the California State Senate and Assembly, California will be the first state in the nation to call for such a convention with a joint resolution being introduced by California State Senator Aisha Wahab and Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer. The Governor will work with grassroots supporters, elected and civic leaders, and broad and diverse coalitions across the nation to fight for the passage of similar resolutions in other state legislatures to ensure the convening of a constitutional convention limited to this subject. 33 other states, in addition to California, would need to take action to convene such a convention.\n“A man of action, Governor Gavin Newsom has the backbone to actually do something about the gun fetish culture around weapons of war, and tackle the relentless problem of gun violence and mass shootings,” said Senator Aisha Wahab. “As someone impacted by gun violence, I have an obligation to elevate the voices of victims and those of us left behind in the wake of tragedy.”\n“I am proud to introduce this resolution to protect the common sense gun reform legislation our Assembly Public Safety Committee has championed over the years,” said Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer. “We cannot stand idly while courts roll back our work and diminish the ability of our Legislature to keep Californians safe. This bold but fair resolution calls on other states to join us in protecting some of the most effective ways of reducing gun violence.”\nWith gun violence claiming the lives of over 110 Americans a day, California’s nation-leading gun safety laws serve as a valuable blueprint for other states and Congress to save lives. California’s gun safety laws work. In its most recent scorecard, California ranked as the #1 state for gun safety by the Giffords Law Center, and according to the most recent data, the state saw a 37% lower gun death rate than the national average. According to the CDC, California’s gun death rate was the 44th lowest in the nation, with 9 gun deaths per 100,000 people – compared to 16.36 deaths per 100,000 nationally, 33.9 in Mississippi, 21.2 in Oklahoma, and 15.6 in Texas.\n###\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Penalties add up for each month you don't comply, but there is a grace period that allows lapses in coverage of 3 or fewer consecutive months. You must be enrolled in health insurance plans that meet Minimum Creditable Coverage (MCC) requirements.\nMost adults already have health insurance, perhaps through their employer or a government program, but if you don't, you or your employer can find the right health insurance plan online.\nYou may also buy plans through approved Massachusetts health insurance carriers. To learn more or buy a plan, contact the Health Connector at (877) 623-6765, TTY number at (877) 623-7773, or visit the Health Connector website.\nRequirements\nWhether or not you have to file a Massachusetts personal income tax return, anyone 18 years old or over must get and maintain creditable health insurance coverage as long as it's considered affordable under the schedule set by the Massachusetts Health Connector. This includes those who are exempt from filing taxes. This health care mandate applies to:\n- Massachusetts residents, and\n- People who become Massachusetts residents within 63 days. Residents who terminate any prior creditable coverage within 63 days must get and maintain creditable coverage within 63 days of terminating.\nIf you're a resident, or in some cases a part-year resident, file Schedule HC with your Form 1 or Form 1-NR/PY. If you don't, this will delay processing your return. Fill in the Health Care Information section on your Schedule HC to prove that you have health insurance that meets MCC requirements.\nIf you have health insurance from more than 2 insurance carriers, fill out Schedule HC-CS as well. Report your 2 most recent insurance carriers first on Schedule HC first and then fill out Schedule HC-CS to report your additional insurance carriers.\nIf you turned 18 in the past tax year, the health care mandate applies to you beginning on the first day of the third full month following your birthday.\nIf a taxpayer dies during the year, the health care mandate applies to the deceased up until the last day of the last full month that they were alive.\nYour health care premiums are tax-deductible if you're self-employed, so you can reduce your taxable income by your health insurance premium's cost. This is reported on Schedule Y of your Massachusetts income tax return. The Massachusetts Health Connector offers health plans on a pre-tax basis.\nChildren and/or dependents\nIf you have an insured benefit plan that provides coverage for dependents, your child can stay on your health plan through the earlier of:\n- Their 26th birthday\n- 2 years after they lost their dependent status according to federal tax rules\nIf your plan is a self-insured plan, check with your plan sponsor to find out how long dependents can stay on your plan. See here for more information on the personal income tax treatment of this benefit.\nCarriers can't impose any limitations on eligibility for dependent coverage, other than limitations defining familial relationships under the policy (e.g., spouse and children, or spouse, children and parents) and any other limitations that may be allowed.\nChanges in residency\nIf you moved into Massachusetts during the year, the health care mandate applies to you beginning on the first day of the third full month following the month you became a Massachusetts resident.\nIf you moved out of Massachusetts during the year, the health care mandate applies to you up until the last day of the last full month you were a resident.\nIf you're a retired Massachusetts resident now living abroad, and you have full health insurance in the country you live in, you can complete your Schedule HC by either:\n- Applying for a Certificate of Exemption from the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, or\n- Requesting an appeal on your Schedule HC.\nIf you were living out of the state (a nonresident of Massachusetts), and thus filed your income tax return in the state you lived in, you aren't subject to the mandate. However, to avoid penalties in the future, you should contact the Massachusetts Health Connector at (877) 623-6765, TTY number at (877) 623-7773, or visit them online.\nAdditional Resources\nMinimum Creditable Coverage (MCC)\nMinimum Creditable Coverage (MCC) is the minimum level of benefits that you need to have to be considered insured and avoid tax penalties in Massachusetts. These benefits include:\n- Coverage for a comprehensive set of services (e.g., doctor visits, hospital admissions, day surgery, emergency services, mental health and substance abuse, and prescription drug coverage).\n- Doctor visits for preventive care without a deductible.\n- A cap on annual deductibles of $2,000 for an individual and $4,000 for a family.\n- For plans with up-front deductibles or co-insurance on core services, an annual maximum on out-of-pocket spending of no more than the annual limit set by the IRS, particularly for high-deductible health plans. Refer to the Massachusetts Health Connector’s Administrative Information Bulletin for annual updates to limitations on out-of-pocket costs for both individual and family plans, entitled “Administrative Information Bulletin XX-XX -Guidance Regarding Minimum Creditable Coverage (MCC) Regulations For Calendar Year 202X.”\n- No caps on total benefits for a particular illness or for a single year.\n- No policy that covers only a fixed dollar amount per day or stay in the hospital, with the patient responsible for all other charges.\n- For policies that have a separate prescription drug deductible, please refer to the Massachusetts Health Connector’s Administrative Information Bulletin for updated deductibles for both individuals and families for the current year.\nIf your plan doesn't meet the MCC requirements for the entire time that the mandate applied to you, fill in the \"No MCC/None\" oval in line 3 of the Schedule HC. You won't be penalized if we determine that you didn't have access to affordable insurance that met MCC.\nPlans that meet MCC\nMost plans meet the MCC standards. You'll know if your plan does because Massachusetts-licensed health insurance companies must put an MCC-compliance notice on their plans to indicate if it does or doesn't meet MCC.\nIf you receive a Form MA 1099-HC from your insurer, it will indicate whether your insurance meets MCC requirements. If you didn't receive one from your insurer and get health coverage through your job, you can call your insurer or your employer's human resources department or benefits administrator for help. If your insurer or your employer can't help you, please refer to list of benefits above to see if your policy meets these requirements. If your plan meets all of the requirements listed above, you may certify that you were enrolled in a plan that met the MCC requirements during that time period.\nYou automatically meet MCC if you're enrolled in:\n- Medicare Part A or B\n- Any Qualified Health Plan purchased through the Massachusetts Health Connector or directly through an insurance carrier, including catastrophic plans\n- MassHealth, except for MassHealth Limited\n- A federally-qualified high deductible health plan (HDHP)\n- A Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) that is only offered in Massachusetts\n- A tribal or Indian Health Service plan\n- TRICARE\n- The U.S. Veterans Administration Health System\n- A health insurance plan offered by the federal government to federal employees or retirees; or\n- Peace Corps, VISTA or AmeriCorps or National Civilian Community Corps coverage\nReceiving services through the Health Safety Net Trust Fund (previously known as the \"Uncompensated Care Pool\" or \"Free Care Pool\") is not considered health insurance, and thus does not meet MCC requirements. If this is the only way in which your health care needs are paid, you must select the No MCC/None oval in line 3 of the Schedule HC.\nIf you were enrolled in an MCC plan for only part of a year, you should fill in the \"Part-Year MCC\" oval in line 3 of the Schedule HC. Next, provide your health insurance information for the MCC plan(s) you were enrolled in. Do not provide health insurance information for a plan that does not meet the MCC standards.\nForm MA 1099-HC\nThis form contains information you need to complete your Schedule HC. Students who are dependents on a parent's insurance plan also need the information on the Form MA 1099-HC to complete their income tax returns.\nInsurance carriers (including MassHealth, Commonwealth Care, or Commonwealth Care Bridge) and certain employers are legally required to issue Forms MA 1099-HC no later than January 31 of the following year.\nReceiving the form\nYou will receive a Form MA 1099-HC if:\n- You have private insurance. You (the plan subscriber) will receive a Form MA 1099-HC from your insurance carrier. It'll also list spouse and dependent information. If you didn't get a form, fill in the Health Care Information section of your Schedule HC with the name of your insurance carrier or administrator and your subscriber number. This information should be on your insurance card. If you can't find it, contact your insurer.\n- You're enrolled in MassHealth, Commonwealth Care or Commonwealth Care Bridge and your income is above 150% of the federal poverty level. If you didn't get a Form MA 1099-HC and your income was at or above 150% of the federal poverty level, you can call MassHealth at (800) 841-2900 or the Massachusetts Health Connector at (877) 623-6765 for a copy.\nIf you receive more than 1 Form MA 1099-HC because you have more than 1 health insurance carrier for the year, you (and/or your spouse, if married filing jointly) must report each carrier that provided health insurance.\nIf you switched coverage or had more than 1 insurance carrier in the year, you'll receive a Form MA 1099-HC from each carrier showing detailed information about specific months of coverage. You need to report each instance of coverage you had as you complete Schedule HC.\nDon't worry if you receive a Form MA 1099-HC that lists your middle initial incorrectly. There will be no problem, since you don't transcribe your name from the Form MA 1099-HC onto the Schedule HC. The important data is the information you carry over from the Form MA 1099-HC to the Schedule HC.\nYou won't receive a Form 1099-HC if:\n- You're enrolled in:\n- Medicare\n- The Veterans Administration Program\n- Tri-Care\n- Or other government insurance.\nInstead, you simply fill in the oval for the plan you were enrolled in on line 4 of Schedule HC.\n- Your income is below 150% of the federal poverty level. There is no penalty for people with incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty level, so you wouldn't need a Form MA-1099-HC. You don't have to answer detailed questions about your coverage on Schedule HC, but you still need to complete it.\n- You have Medicare supplemental insurance or a replacement plan you bought on your own. Medicare includes supplemental and replacement plans for this purpose. However, you should still fill in the Medicare bubble in Schedule HC to complete the form properly.\nAdditional Resources\nPenalty\nYou'll only be penalized for lacking insurance if you can afford to get health insurance but didn't. The penalties vary depending upon your income, age and family size. Penalties can be no more than half the lowest priced plan available to an individual through the ConnectorCare health insurance.\nThe individual mandate penalty applies only to adults who can afford health insurance. If, according to the state affordability schedule, you have no affordable options, you won't be penalized. There's no penalty if your income is at or below 150% of the federal poverty level because there is no premium and therefore no penalty. See the guidelines regarding the tax penalties for not having health insurance.\nPaying the penalty\nYour penalty amount will be calculated and entered on Form 1 or Form 1-NR/PY. If you owe more than you are getting back in refund, pay the amount of tax due on the tax return. We will send a bill if the amount of tax due is not paid with the return.\nAppealing the penalty\nYou can appeal the penalty if you were unable to get affordable insurance due to a hardship or other circumstances. If the Connector denies or dismisses your appeal, you'll receive a bill from DOR.\nYou can also base your appeal on other circumstances. For example, income changes or life circumstances might have affected your financial status during the year so that applying the affordability tables in Schedule HC was inequitable. You could have been unable to get government-subsidized insurance despite your income, or other circumstances that made you unable to buy insurance.\nHardships\nTo appeal a penalty, you have to show that you experienced any of the following hardships during the tax year:\n- You were homeless, more than 30 days late in rent or mortgage payments, or received an eviction or foreclosure notice.\n- You received a shut-off notice, were shut off, or were refused the delivery of essential utilities (gas, electric, oil, water, or telephone).\n- Your essential expenses increased significantly and unexpectedly due to the direct consequences of:\n- Domestic violence\n- The death of a spouse, family member, or partner with primary responsibility for child care, where that spouse, family member, or partner shared household expenses with you\n- The sudden responsibility for providing full care for yourself, an aging parent or other family member, including a major, extended illness of a child that required a working parent to hire a full-time caretaker for the child, or\n- A fire, flood, natural disaster, or other unexpected natural or human-caused event causing substantial household or personal damage for the individual filing the appeal.\n- Your financial circumstances were such that the expense of buying health insurance would have caused you to experience a serious deprivation of food, shelter, clothing or other necessities.\n- Your family size was so large that relying on the affordability schedule (see Table 3: Affordability in Schedule HC) to determine how much you could afford to pay for health insurance is inequitable.\n- During the year, you bought health insurance that didn't meet MCC requirements because that is all that your employer offered, and you felt that your circumstances prevented you from buying other insurance that met the requirements.\nAdditional Resources\n- TIR 25-1: Individual Mandate Penalties for Tax Year 2025\n- TIR 24-1: Individual Mandate Penalties for Tax Year 2024\n- TIR 22-17: Individual Mandate Penalties for Tax Year 2023\n- TIR 22-3: Individual Mandate Penalties for Tax Year 2022\n- TIR 21-1: Individual Mandate Penalties for Tax Year 2021\n- TIR 20-1: Individual Mandate Penalties for Tax Year 2020\n- TIR 19-1: Individual Mandate Penalties for Tax Year 2019\n- TIR 18-2: Individual Mandate Penalties for Tax Year 2018\n- TIR 17-1: Individual Mandate Penalties for Tax Year 2017\n- Learn how to appeal the health care penalty\nCoverage changes\nThere is a grace period for people who have a gap in coverage. You can go up to 3 consecutive months without penalty, and multiple lapses are allowed within 1 calendar year. Therefore, if you lose your coverage but then resume coverage within 3 or fewer calendar months, you won't be penalized. We'll know how long you've had coverage because insurance carriers submit the same Form MA 1099-HC information to us as well.\nIf you go 4 or more consecutive months without insurance, you need to determine if you have access to affordable health insurance, either through an employer, the government, or on your own.\nGetting insurance in the middle of a month\nIf you had insurance for 15 days or more in a month, it will be treated as a full month of coverage. Otherwise, coverage of 14 days or less will be counted as a month without coverage. This calculation will be reflected in the Form MA 1099-HC.\nEmployment\nIf you can't afford health insurance payments while you're unemployed (before your new health insurance becomes effective through your new employer), check with your previous employer's human resource department about possibly extending your coverage until your new insurance becomes effective. You may also want to speak to the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority or the Division of Unemployment Assistance about other options. However, if your waiting period is 3 or fewer consecutive months, you fall within the permitted grace period and won't be penalized.\nIf you recently lost your job but got coverage through COBRA, you won't be subject to penalties. Losing your job is considered a \"qualifying event\" in most cases, which means that you are temporarily entitled to the same health plan coverage you had while you were employed. As long as the insurance you had through your former employment met MCC standards, you won't be penalized as long as you maintain that coverage through COBRA.\nContact\nPhone\n9 a.m.–4 p.m., Monday through Friday\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Shae-Marie Stafford-Trujillo has spent a lot of time in hospitals.\nAt the age of 23, she’s been diagnosed with narcolepsy, osteopenia (low bone density), an optic nerve disorder, and fluid in her brain. She also grew up with family members going from doctor to doctor for their own chronic illnesses.\nHer impression of physicians wasn’t always positive. Some doctors dismissed her symptoms. Some made her family members feel their suffering didn’t matter.\nBut some listened. Some fought for her.\nBoth the negative and positive experiences fueled her desire to pursue a career in medicine.\n“I have so much of a passion for patients, being a patient myself,” Stafford-Trujillo says. “I refuse to let anybody feel how I have felt and continue to feel — broken down by the system.”\nShe is currently enrolled in a postbaccalaureate program at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and works in a neuroscience lab while studying for the MCAT® exam and preparing to apply to medical school next year.\nBut now, as the U.S. Congress considers legislation that could result in significant limits on federal student loans and change the criteria for medical residents qualifying for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, Stafford-Trujillo worries she won’t be able to afford to go to medical school at all.\n“Most people my age have already taken out loans. [I did] to go to college, to live, for the postbaccalaureate program,” she says. Limiting federal student loan borrowing “would make medical school not an option. Period.”\nThe legislation working its way through Congress could limit one type of federal loan relied on by all medical student borrowers (Direct Unsubsidized loans) and eliminate another key loan program (Grad PLUS) used by over half of medical student borrowers. Other details of the legislation will impact most areas of higher education.\nThe proposed changes have prompted an outcry from members of the medical community, as well as opposition from the AAMC, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, the American Medical Association (AMA), and dozens of other physician groups.\nThe groups have published statements and sent letters to Congress arguing that the changes could worsen the physician shortage, prevent people from lower-income backgrounds from pursuing medicine, and drive doctors away from lower-compensated jobs, such as those in primary care specialties and working with underserved populations.\n“Every aspiring physician deserves a fair chance at a medical education — no matter their economic background. Federal student aid programs like Grad PLUS loans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness help make that possible for nearly half of all medical students,” AAMC President and CEO David J. Skorton, MD, and Chief Public Policy Officer Danielle Turnipseed, JD, MHSA, MPP, said in a statement. “Eliminating or restricting these critical programs would undermine the future physician workforce and ultimately make it harder for patients in communities nationwide to get the care they need.”\nLoan caps\nAs part of the spending bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the U.S. House of Representatives passed several changes that would impact medical student borrowers starting July 1, 2026, should it become law. On June 10, the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions released a proposed bill with some differences from the House version. If it passes in the Senate, it will have to be reconciled with the House before it goes to President Donald J. Trump to be signed into law.\nThe House bill limits federal Direct Unsubsidized loans for students in graduate and professional programs, including medicine, to a total of $150,000. The Senate proposal sets the limit for professional programs at $200,000. Both versions eliminate Direct PLUS (Grad PLUS) loans, which were introduced in 2006 and allow graduate students to borrow up to an institution’s established cost of attendance to pay for expenses related to their studies, including living expenses.\nThe median amount of debt for the medical school graduate class of 2024 was $205,000. The median four-year cost of medical school attendance for the class of 2025 was $286,454 for public schools and $390,848 for private schools, according to AAMC data. About half of all medical students take out Grad PLUS loans, totaling more than $2 billion annually.\nThose who would need additional funds would have to take out private loans, which can be more difficult to qualify for, have higher interest rates, and do not offer income-based repayment or loan-forgiveness options.\nAidan Hintze, MD, who will be starting his general surgery residency at AdventHealth in Orlando, Florida, this July, says that Grad PLUS loans helped him attend medical school at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey while supporting his family.\nHintze says that, when he and his wife decided that he would attend medical school, they crunched the numbers and found that child care and transportation costs associated with his wife’s working would have offset the benefits of her salary. At the time, they had a one-year-old daughter and have since added two more girls to their family.\n“I ultimately ended up choosing a school that had the better financial aid package, scholarships, and cost of tuition,” Hintze says. “Grad PLUS loans opened up the opportunity for my wife to stay home. We wanted to give our kids something rock solid in a stressful time.”\nHintze says he is worried that current and future medical students will face more significant financial barriers than he did.\n“I’m fairly terrified for the state of medicine. I have a brother-in-law in medical school, and thinking about him needing to take out loans next year … I don’t know how he’s going to make ends meet,” he says. “I have friends whose parents were able to pay their rent or other expenses, but I don’t want medicine to become one of those careers you can only do if you have wealthy parents.”\nIn fact, a 2018 AAMC study found that between a quarter and a third of all medical students came from households with an income in the top 5% in the country. More recent studies have shown modest increases in socioeconomic diversity among medical students.\nProponents of the changes to student loans argue that the availability of Grad PLUS loans incentivizes medical schools to increase tuition, and that reducing loan options for students would force tuition reductions, thus minimizing the amount of loans students would need to complete medical school.\nBut an AAMC analysis found that, in the four years after Grad PLUS loans were introduced, the average annual growth rate for medical school tuition slowed compared with the four years before the loans were introduced, after adjusting for inflation. And since 2020, the average medical school tuition and fees have grown at a slower rate than inflation, while general living expenses increased faster than the rate of inflation.\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness\nAnother program that could face changes in the pending legislation is PSLF, which was passed into law in 2007. Under the program, people who work full-time for a qualified employer (generally a nonprofit or government organization) and make 120 monthly payments (usually over 10 years) can have the rest of their loan balance forgiven. Since teaching hospitals are often eligible employers, many physicians who intend to work in public service jobs after residency can also count their time in residency toward their loan forgiveness. In a 2024 AAMC survey, 63% of graduating medical students indicated they planned to enter a loan-forgiveness program, and of those, 88% indicated they intended to pursue PSLF.\nBoth the House bill and the Senate proposal exclude time in residency from counting toward PSLF. The House bill would allow medical residents to defer loans without interest accrual for up to four years, but the Senate proposal does not include this provision.\nThese changes would go into effect for loans borrowed after July 1, 2026, so current residents would still be eligible under the existing guidelines.\nUnder current policy, students have several options for repaying loans, including income-driven plans that scale monthly payments at a percentage of a borrower’s discretionary income. One AAMC simulation of paying off $205,000 in direct federal loans shows that interest over 10 to 23 years could add anywhere from $133,000 to $250,000 to the loan, depending on the repayment plan, with those receiving PSLF paying the lowest amount. The House bill and Senate proposal also change the options for repayment for those taking out loans starting July 2026.\nFor Melissa Robinson, MD, a pediatrician and interim associate dean for admissions at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville, the idea that the prospective medical students she works with now may not be afforded the benefits that she reaped from PSLF is disheartening.\nRobinson says that knowing she would be eligible for loan forgiveness helped her choose pediatrics, a specialty compensated at lower rates than many other medical specialties. She completed her residency training in 2017 and turned in the PSLF paperwork last year. Six months later, she received a letter noting that her debt balance had been forgiven.\n“It’s made a huge difference. Having a path to the forgiveness really helped reduce the stress of having that debt, even before paying it off, and it really opened the door to allowing me to go to medical school wherever I wanted that best fit my needs and desires and mission in the field of medicine,” Robinson says. “It opened a whole pathway of career that I didn’t know about right when I first started medical school.”\nNow, as a dean of admissions, Robinson works with incoming medical students and has heard firsthand how uncertainty around loan-forgiveness options might steer qualified applicants away from primary care fields, working in underserved communities, or even away from medicine altogether.\nLeana Nápoles, MD, who is completing her pediatric residency this summer, was careful to make sure the county clinic she will work for after residency qualified her for PSLF. Before attending medical school, she worked in the Peace Corps at an HIV/AIDS clinic in Ecuador and at a research lab at the University of California San Francisco, which, along with her three years of residency, give her six years of qualification toward PSLF.\n“It gave me some nice financial support, that if I did want to do this — to work for underserved people — I’m not going to get into mounds and mounds of debt,” Nápoles says.\nNow, even though the policy changes in the proposed plan wouldn't impact her, she worries that the uncertainty and future federal policy changes could still jeopardize her loan-forgiveness plans. And she’s even more worried for the medical students who would be directly impacted by any changes.\nNápoles acknowledges she came into medical school with some privilege, including that her father is a doctor and she had some support from her family when she had no income. But even with these privileges, the student debt she’s accumulated has impacted her financially. She was recently denied a small car loan due to her student debt load.\nShe understands how the fear of taking on debt without the promise of forgiveness might deter students from pursuing a medical specialty or practice area that is focused on underserved populations.\n“PSLF is not just a policy,” Nápoles says. “It’s a lifeline that makes service-driven medicine possible.”\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        An Analysis of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s Effect on Student Loans\nKey Points\n- Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which makes numerous changes to the federal student loan program, saving $307 billion.\n- Graduate students and parents of undergraduates will be subject to new caps on federal lending. Loan limits for undergraduate students remain unchanged.\n- The bill creates a new income-driven student loan repayment plan that will prevent borrowers’ balances from rising over time and ensure that most borrowers pay down their loans quickly.\n- Colleges and universities are held accountable for poor student outcomes; degree programs where graduates’ earnings are too low will lose access to federal funding.\nIntroduction\nAt the beginning of July, President Donald Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), a comprehensive package of reforms to taxes and government spending.1 While the package touches on myriad policy areas, it includes a comprehensive set of reforms to the federal student loan program. These represent some of the most consequential changes to federal higher education policy in years.\nTaken together, the changes to student loans will save taxpayers $307 billion over a decade, according to preliminary estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).2 But as this report’s analysis shows, the changes could also rein in the growth of tuition, prevent excessive interest accumulation on student debts, and hold colleges accountable for poor student outcomes.\nThe bill pursues these goals through three principal mechanisms. First, it sets limits on how much students may borrow from the federal government. Second, it overhauls student loan repayment to reverse some of the repayment system’s costliest aspects and ensure borrowers can pay down their debts. Finally, it creates a new accountability framework to deny student loans to colleges with poor outcomes. This report analyzes each of the three policies in turn.\nLoan Limits\nThe federal student loan program suffers from excessive levels of borrowing. While the government caps lending to undergraduate students at modest levels, graduate students and parents of undergraduates may borrow up to their college’s cost of attendance—which is defined by the college.3 Because institutions set their own prices, this means that lending to graduate students and parents is effectively unlimited.\nUnder current policy, the federal government is expected to originate just over $1 trillion in new student loans over the coming decade. Of that, around half ($511 billion) will go to graduate students,4 even though graduate students account for just 17 percent of overall postsecondary enrollment.5\nBecause graduate students have access to effectively unlimited loans, their per-student debt burdens are significantly higher—and rising (Figure 1). In 2020, average debt for those completing a master’s degree stood at $62,820, a 50 percent increase over the past 20 years. Average debt for professional programs (including law and medicine) was $197,750 in 2020, an 80 percent increase since 2000.6\nAnother $123 billion in federal loans will go to parents of undergraduates over the coming decade.7 While it is a small piece of student loans in absolute terms, Parent PLUS, the federal parent-lending program, is borderline predatory: The loans carry a 9.08 percent interest rate and a 4.228 percent origination fee, and they are ineligible for many safety-net benefits available on other student loans.8 Wealthy universities have pushed tens of thousands of dollars of debt on lower-income parents who have subsequently failed to pay down balances.9 One-fifth of Parent PLUS borrowers have an “expected family contribution” of zero—meaning the federal government has determined these families have too low an income to contribute anything toward their children’s education.10 For the federal government to determine that a parent has little means to repay a loan, then turn around and give that parent an effectively unlimited loan, is unconscionable.\nIn addition to higher debt burdens, researchers have concluded that unlimited lending to graduate students11 and parents of undergraduates12 has led colleges to raise tuition.\nHow OBBB Changes Loan Limits\nOBBB introduces new annual loan limits for graduate students and parents of undergraduates (Table 1). Most graduate programs, including most master’s degree and PhD programs, will face an annual loan limit of $20,500. Students in professional graduate degree programs, which include medicine, dentistry, law, theology, and other degree types as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, will be able to borrow up to $50,000 per year.13\nColleges may set lower annual loan limits for particular programs if they so choose. Loan limits are prorated for students who enroll in college less than full time; a student who enrolls half-time would be eligible for half the loan limit of a full-time student.\nIn addition to annual limits, OBBB also subjects students to aggregate loan limits that represent the total maximum a student can borrow across their academic career. For most graduate students, the limit is $100,000 (not including any debt the student took on for their undergraduate education). Professional students will face an aggregate limit of $200,000.\nOBBB will not change loan limits for undergraduate students, which currently range from $5,500 to $12,500 annually depending on the student’s class level and dependency status.14 However, Parent PLUS loans will now be subject to an annual per-child limit of $20,000. Parents may borrow no more than $65,000 in aggregate for the education of each child.\nHow the New Loan Limits Will Affect Students and Taxpayers\nTo understand how the new loan limits will affect students’ ability to borrow, we can turn to the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, which collects information on the annual borrowing of current graduate students.\nFigure 2 shows the percentage of graduate students who currently borrow above the loan limits in OBBB for different degree categories. For instance, 31 percent of graduate students pursuing a master’s degree in education or teaching do not borrow, while 56 percent borrow less than $20,500 per year. Thirteen percent, however, borrow more than the OBBB limit of $20,500 and would thus be “constrained” by the law’s loan caps. While this provision will not affect access for the median master’s of education student, the loan limits will constrain borrowing (and likely tuition) for the highest-cost master of education programs.\nOverall, just under 20 percent of master’s students borrow above the proposed limits, along with 8 percent of students in doctoral programs. Some specific degree types, especially master of public health, master of fine arts, and master of social work, will see around a quarter to a third of students constrained by the new caps. Also constrained are master’s degree programs at private nonprofit universities, where 25 percent of students borrow above the caps. By contrast, just 10 percent of master’s students at public universities exceed the new annual borrowing limits.\nThe goal of these loan limits is to encourage the highest-cost programs to reduce their prices. That is likely to be true for programs on the extreme ends of the price distribution. Master of social work programs, for instance, have wildly varying prices and debt burdens; students enrolled in the most expensive degrees will see their ability to borrow reduced.15 This will encourage those expensive schools to lower their prices, or else drive students to choose lower-priced programs instead.\nProfessional programs are more likely to be affected by the new limits. Just over 40 percent of medical students today borrow over OBBB’s $50,000 annual limit. However, professional students in programs with a high return on investment could likely borrow additional sums in the private student loan market. Research has shown that when graduate student loans were capped prior to 2006, most students who needed them could secure private loans at reasonable interest rates.16 Moreover, private lenders may be better equipped than the federal government to impose price discipline on universities.\nThe new limits on Parent PLUS loans are far less likely to be a constraint. According to the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, just 10 percent of parents of dependent undergraduate students use Parent PLUS loans; of those who do, only one-third borrow more than OBBB’s $20,000 annual cap on Parent PLUS loans. That means only 3 percent of dependent undergraduates will face a liquidity constraint due to the Parent PLUS cap. The Parent PLUS cap is most likely to limit students at private nonprofit institutions charging the highest tuition prices; these are precisely the institutions where it is necessary for the federal government to step in and impose cost discipline through loan limits.\nAccording to CBO’s score of the legislation, OBBB’s loan limits will save taxpayers $44 billion over the coming decade.17\nRepayment Reform\nCongress and the Education Department have created several income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which allow borrowers to tie their payments to their incomes, with any remaining balances forgiven after a set period of time. The concept makes sense in principle because borrowers’ incomes fluctuate over time; the loan payment for a recent college graduate earning $50,000 should be different from the payment for a mid-career professional earning $150,000. Moreover, IDR protects borrowers who lose their jobs; research has shown that the plans prevent loan defaults.18\nBut Democratic administrations have transformed IDR into a vehicle to provide mass loan cancellation. Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden created new IDR plans that slashed monthly payments and delivered loan forgiveness faster. This trend reached an apogee with the 2023 Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which gave half of borrowers a $0 monthly payment, forgave loans in as little as 10 years, and would have cost taxpayers $276 billion.19 (Even if Congress hadn’t repealed it, SAVE would likely have been struck down in court as an unconstitutional overextension of executive authority.)20\nBut IDR was problematic even before SAVE. Over one-third of borrowers had a $0 monthly payment in 2018 under IDR plans that predated the Biden administration.21 The CBO issued a projection in 2020 that IDR plans would result in over $200 billion in loan forgiveness over 10 years.22 This toxic combination of unlimited loans and unlimited forgiveness at the graduate level encouraged overborrowing, with institutions such as Georgetown Law School actively encouraging their students to take on higher debts.23\nYet many borrowers do not accurately weigh the risks of IDR, because the plans’ structure often results in negative amortization—or rising balances over time. This often occurs when low payments do not cover accrued interest; between 2013 and 2019, over three-quarters of new borrowers who enrolled in IDR saw their balances rise.24 IDR borrowers not on track to receive loan forgiveness often pay more in the long run, thanks to interest accrual. Rising balances are a common source of complaints about the student loan program and have partially fueled the political demand for loan forgiveness.\nHow OBBB Changes Student Loan Repayment\nFor new borrowers, OBBB eliminates all current repayment plans and replaces them with just two: a standard plan and a new IDR plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). The standard plan sets level “mortgage-style” payments over an amortization period of 10 to 25 years, depending on the borrower’s initial balance. Borrowers who choose the standard plan will pay the same amount every month regardless of their incomes.\nRAP, by contrast, varies payments with incomes. It sets a minimum monthly payment of $10, which is binding on only the lowest-income borrowers. For other borrowers, payments are a set percentage of income: 1 percent for borrowers earning between $10,000 and $20,000, 2 percent for borrowers earning between $20,000 and $30,000, and so on up to 10 percent for borrowers who earn more than $100,000. The plan reduces the borrower’s scheduled monthly payment by $50 for each dependent child.\nAs with all IDR plans, sometimes payments under RAP are insufficient to cover accrued interest. The plan therefore waives unpaid interest for borrowers who make on-time payments, to ensure balances do not rise over time. The plan also provides a matching credit to the borrower’s principal—worth up to $50— to ensure borrowers pay down their principal balances every month.\nFor example, if a borrower makes a $50 payment but faces monthly accrued interest of $75, under normal circumstances their balance would rise by $25. But under RAP, the borrower’s $25 of unpaid interest is waived. The government also provides a credit of $50 to the borrower’s principal balance, to ensure the amount they owe goes down.\nRAP cancels any unpaid outstanding balances after the borrower makes 30 years’ worth of payments, though most borrowers are likely to pay their debts in full long before reaching the 30-year mark.25\nNew borrowers as of July 1, 2026, will be able to choose only the new standard repayment plan or the Repayment Assistance Plan. (Current borrowers will maintain access to some of the existing repayment plans.) OBBB also eliminates the vague statutory language that allowed the Education Department to create new repayment plans such as SAVE without explicit Congressional assent. This will most likely block the executive branch from unilaterally creating new repayment plans going forward.\nHow RAP Will Affect Typical Borrowers\nScheduled monthly payments under RAP are significantly higher than those under the Biden administration’s SAVE plan for borrowers of the same income levels (Figure 3). For instance, a borrower who earns $80,000 per year would pay $179 per month under SAVE but $533 per month under RAP. These increases in monthly payments drive the bill’s cost savings.\nHowever, scheduled monthly payments under RAP are comparable to historical norms on IDR plans. For most borrowers, payments under RAP are comparable to scheduled payments under the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan, which was created under the Obama administration and is the most heavily subsidized extant IDR plan other than SAVE. Because PAYE caps monthly payments, borrowers at the higher end of the income spectrum pay substantially more per month under RAP than under PAYE.\nConsider the example of a typical undergraduate borrower who finishes college with $30,000 in debt and a $45,000 starting salary. Under RAP, that borrower’s monthly payment in the first year of repayment stands at $150. This is insufficient to cover their accrued monthly interest of $163, so the government waives the $13 of unpaid interest and provides a $50 credit to their principal balance. Their balance therefore drops by $600 during the first year of repayment.\nAs the borrower progresses through their career, their income rises—and so do their monthly payments. In the fourth year of repayment, their salary is $57,000 and their monthly payment is $237, which is sufficient to fully cover interest and pay down principal. The higher payments enable the balances to be paid down faster, and the borrower retires their loans in full in just over 10 years.\nWhile monthly payments under PAYE are comparable to those under RAP, accrued interest under PAYE keeps balances higher for longer, and the same borrower would take 13 years to pay off their loans under that plan (Figure 4). Under the SAVE plan, which waives unpaid monthly interest but slashes payments to minimal levels, the same borrower hangs onto their loans for two decades before they are finally forgiven.\nTable 2 compares repayment outcomes for the same borrower under RAP, PAYE, and SAVE. Under RAP, this typical undergraduate borrower pays $32,788 over the lifetime of their loan, in present value terms. This is a savings of approximately $1,500 relative to total payments under PAYE. Though the borrower pays more under RAP than they would under SAVE, they also retire their debts much faster.\nThe same basic trends hold for lower-income college graduates. A college graduate with a starting salary of just $30,000 will start out making payments of $75 under RAP (Table 3). They collect interest and principal subsidies for the first several years of repayment, but these keep the balance to a manageable level. They repay their loans in full within 16 years. By contrast, PAYE and SAVE set this borrower’s payments lower and do not provide the same degree of repayment assistance. Under both plans, the borrower pays for 20 years and receives loan forgiveness.\nFor many undergraduate borrowers, total payments are lower under RAP than under PAYE. But RAP produces significant savings for the government on graduate student loans. In large part, this is because RAP substantially scales back the loan forgiveness aspects of IDR—which overwhelmingly benefited graduate borrowers, even under pre-SAVE IDR plans such as PAYE.\nConsider a typical master’s degree holder who owes $80,000 and earns a starting salary of $60,000 (Table 4). Under PAYE and SAVE, this borrower has nearly $70,000 forgiven at the end of their repayment term; under RAP, they pay off their loans in full after 19 years. Total discounted payments under RAP are $96,324, an increase of roughly $12,000 relative to PAYE and over $24,000 relative to SAVE.\nThe same is true for a hypothetical law school graduate who owes $150,000 and enjoys a starting salary of $75,000 (Table 5). Under PAYE and SAVE, this individual enjoys loan forgiveness at the end of their repayment term but repays in full after 19 years under RAP. RAP also increases total payments by a significant margin.\nThe key to RAP is consistently declining balances, which allow the plan to avoid the large loan forgiveness outlays of PAYE and SAVE. Most RAP borrowers pay off their loans in a reasonable amount of time. Borrowers with typical debt burdens and earnings trajectories for their degree levels will not get close to paying their loans for 30 years. Moreover, borrowers who see their balances go down over time will have more confidence that they will eventually pay off their debts. This increases the likelihood that they will remain engaged with the loan system.\nRAP produces significant fiscal savings relative to SAVE for all types of borrowers. In terms of total payments, undergraduate borrowers pay less under RAP than they do under PAYE, but the government gets its money back with higher total payments for graduate borrowers.\nOverall, CBO estimates that OBBB’s changes to loan repayment will save taxpayers $271 billion over a decade relative to a baseline in which the SAVE plan is extant.26 But OBBB saves slightly more money than simply repealing SAVE would have. CBO estimated in 2023 that a clean repeal of the SAVE plan would have saved taxpayers $261 billion.27 It is likely that RAP and the other changes to loan repayment under OBBB would save money even if SAVE had never existed.\nAccountability for Colleges\nToo often, higher education does not produce an ROI for students. Many who pursue postsecondary education end up worse off financially if the increase in earnings resulting from their education does not exceed its costs. Degree and certificate programs with mediocre earnings, high tuition, and low completion rates often leave students with no ROI.\nAccording to my research for the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, 23 percent of bachelor’s degree programs, 43 percent of associate degree programs, and 43 percent of master’s degree programs have no ROI. Many colleges use low-ROI programs as cash cows: Overall, roughly a third of federal student loan and Pell Grant funding flows to programs with negative ROI.28\nA lack of ROI is a problem for students who don’t enjoy the benefits from a college education that they hoped for. It is also a problem for taxpayers, who must bear the costs when students fail to pay back their loans in full. Finally, low college ROI harms the broader economy, because it prevents students from reaching their full potential in the labor force.29\nHow OBBB Holds Colleges Accountable: The “Do No Harm” Test\nOBBB institutes a “do no harm” test for higher education. The law revokes a degree program’s eligibility for federal student loans if the earnings of its graduates are too low.\nSpecifically, the government measures the median annual earnings of graduates four years after completing their programs (excluding any who are enrolled in school elsewhere). It then compares these earnings to a benchmark chosen by program to represent what those students might have earned had they not pursued the degree in the first place. The rationale is that if graduates do not out-earn this benchmark, the degree program is likely producing no economic value—and may even be harmful to students.\nFor undergraduate degree programs, the benchmark is equal to the median earnings of working individuals age 25 to 34 in the same state as the institution who have only a high school diploma. For institutions where more than half of students hail from out of state, the benchmark is based on the national population of high school graduates.\nFor graduate programs, the benchmark is equal to the median earnings of working individuals age 25 to 34 who have only a bachelor’s degree and are in the same state as the institution, have an undergraduate degree in the same field of study as the program, or are in the same state and field of study. The benchmark is the lowest of these three options. Again, the benchmarks are calculated based on national populations if more than half of students at the institution are out of state.\nThese benchmarks are applied at the program level. A school’s engineering program may pass the earnings benchmark test, while the gender studies program fails. The law empowers the secretary of education to group small programs together in order to achieve a minimum sample size for measuring graduates’ earnings.\nIf a program fails the earnings benchmark test for two out of any three consecutive years, the institution can no longer disburse federal loans to students enrolled in that program. Students in the program may continue to access Pell Grants. After a program loses eligibility, its institution may apply to the secretary of education to regain eligibility for that program provided at least two years of ineligibility have passed.\nThe law includes some exemptions. Undergraduate certificate programs are not subject to the earnings benchmark test. Students who enroll at an institution but do not finish a degree program do not have their earnings included in any cohort for accountability purposes. This is a concern for institutions with high dropout rates, who might continue to enjoy access to federal loans despite not increasing their students’ earnings above the benchmark.\nThe Impact of “Do No Harm” on Colleges and Universities\nThe “do no harm” test in OBBB will leave the vast majority of degree and certificate programs untouched. But a subset of degree programs with abysmal earnings outcomes are likely to fall below the bill’s earnings benchmark and lose access to federal student loan funding.\nFigure 5 illustrates the types of programs most likely to pass the “do no harm” test. Undergraduate certificate programs universally pass, as they are exempt. Around a fifth of two-year (associate) degree programs are expected to fail, especially two-year degrees in liberal arts and general studies. It is important to keep in mind, though, that students in these programs are less likely to use loans to begin with; many will be able to continue operating even if they lose loan access.\nJust 3 percent of bachelor’s degree programs would fail the “do no harm” test. These are largely in fields with extremely low earnings, including drama (24 percent pass rate) and dance (27 percent).\nA smattering of higher degree programs are also likely to lose access to federal loans. Around 8 percent of master’s degree programs—especially those at private institutions—do not generate sufficient earnings to pass the “do no harm” test. Programs with especially low pass rates include alternative medicine (0 percent), mental and social health services (16 percent), music (18 percent), fine arts (25 percent), and English literature (33 percent).\nDoctoral and professional degree programs are mostly unaffected, given their higher earnings, though professional programs at private for-profit colleges are an exception. Professional programs in mental and social health services, which are disproportionately offered at for-profit colleges, universally fail the “do no harm” test and are the drivers of this sector’s low pass rate.\nWhile the field of study is generally a stronger predictor of which programs will fail the “do no harm” test, certain institutions disproportionately offer programs that lead to poor earnings outcomes. Table 6 lists the 18 institutions with more than 5,000 students enrolled in programs that are likely to fail, as of the 2021–22 academic year. Combined, these 18 institutions enrolled over 200,000 students in failing programs in 2021–22, disbursing over $800 million in federal loans to these students.\nThe list includes major for-profit colleges such as Ashford University and Capella University, along with private nonprofits with a significant online presence such as Southern New Hampshire University and Liberty University. Some of these institutions, including Liberty and Ultimate Medical Academy, stand to lose over $100 million apiece in annual federal student loan funding.\nSeveral large community college systems such as Indiana’s Ivy Tech Community College and Ohio’s Eastern Gateway Community College also enroll thousands of students in programs that are likely to fail the “do no harm” test. However, the effect of the legislation on these institutions may be more modest because they tend to rely far less on student loans than private institutions. South Texas College, which enrolls over 8,800 students in failing programs, does not participate in the federal student loan program at all.30 The “do no harm” test will therefore not affect this school.\nOverall, in 2021–22 the federal government disbursed $3.3 billion worth of federal loans to students in programs that are likely to fail the “do no harm” test. While this represents a small portion (4 percent) of the $93 billion in overall student loan disbursements that year,31 the programs’ poor outcomes mean students are likely to repay those loans at low rates. Avoiding loan disbursements to those programs in the future means the federal government will save money; CBO estimates that the accountability provisions of OBBB will save roughly $800 million over 10 years.32\nWhile that is a relatively small savings compared to the other components of the bill, the impact could be greater in the long term. The “do no harm” standard means that colleges and universities will think twice before creating new low-quality programs and relying on student loans to fund them. Introducing a new degree only to lose loan access after a few years due to poor earnings outcomes will be a riskier proposition for colleges going forward. That caution will protect students—and limit the student loan program’s downside risk for taxpayers.\nConclusion\nThe “big beautiful bill” contains significant reforms to the student loan program. Student loan limits, repayment reform, and accountability for colleges will transform the federal role in higher education, largely for the better. While the changes will save taxpayers over $300 billion, they will also ameliorate some of the most vexing problems in the student loan system: excessive borrowing, runaway interest, and lavish funding for degree programs with a poor ROI for students. The reforms enacted in OBBB represent a significant improvement for the student loan program, which will better protect students and taxpayers.\nAbout the Author\nPreston Cooper is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, where his work focuses on higher education ROI, student loans, and higher education reform.\n- One Big Beautiful Bill Act, H.R. 1, 119th Cong.

And we'll come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat,\" he said, accusing Senator Obama of denying the achievements of US troops in the war.\nBut Senator Obama hit back, saying \"six years ago I stood up and opposed this war,\" condemning Senator McCain for standing with President Bush over the 2003 US-led invasion to topple dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\"I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right but that's not the case,\" Senator Obama said.\nAnd he accused his rival of a catalogue of miscalculations on Iraq.\n\"When the war started you said it was quick and easy, you said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.\n\"You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni and you were wrong.\"\nDangerous Iran\nBut Senator McCain went on the attack over Senator Obama's offer to offer dialogue to Iran.\n\"It isn't just naive, it is dangerous,\" Senator McCain said, warning that a nuclear armed Tehran threatened a \"second Holocaust.\"\nSenator Obama agreed a nuclear Iran would be a \"game-changer\" and urged tougher sanctions over its nuclear program. But he also defended his call for diplomacy.\n\"We also have to engage in tough, direct diplomacy with Iran,\" he said, adding he would reserve the right as president \"to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.\"\nSenator Obama said the United States could not tolerate a nuclear Iran, and urged tougher sanctions over its suspect nuclear program.\n\"We also have to engage in tough, direct diplomacy with Iran,\" Senator Obama said, adding he would reserve the right as president \"to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.\"\nSenator Obama defended his vow to launch military attacks on extremists in Pakistan if Islamabad was unwilling or able to act.\n\"You don't say that out loud,\" Senator McCain said.\nBut Senator Obama hit back, recalling an unguarded moment by Senator McCain months ago on the campaign trail in Iowa.\n\"Coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know how credible that is.\"\nSenator McCain also accused Senator Obama of being wrong on Russia, seeing he had been too soft on Moscow over the showdown with Georgia.\n\"Again, a little bit of naivete there, he doesn't understand Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia,\" he said.\nFinancial crisis\nAs the United States was pummelled by a vicious financial crisis, the opening exchanges of the debate were over economic policy.\nSenator Obama said the financial crisis was \"the final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain\" and lashed his rival for saying last week the US economy was fundamentally \"strong.\"\n\"I just fundamentally disagree,\" he said, as he pressed for relief for \"Main Street\" mortgage holders and tax cuts to restore middle-class prosperity.\nSenator McCain only decided 10 hours before the debate that he would show up, after saying it should be delayed by the financial crisis.\nHe presented himself as a champion of reform and scourge of wasteful spending, and defended his sudden return to Washington to deal with the financial meltdown.\n- ABC/AFP\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Even today, after millions of Americans have lost their jobs and taxpayers have been forced to bailout Wall Street, Republicans continue to deny that there is a problem. Instead, Republican leader John Boehner, Republican Whip Eric Cantor, and the rest of the Republican Party can be found on Capitol Hill begging Washington lobbyists to kill a bill that would finally bring accountability and integrity back to our financial system.\nNow, the Republicans have offered a substitute bill, an alternative to H.R. 4173 that does virtually nothing to address the causes leading to last year’s financial crisis. In fact, the Republican “alternative” wholly rejects the notion that Wall Street should be held accountable or that consumers need more protections from deceptive banks and greedy lenders. If the Republican plan passes, it will mean business as usual on Wall Street, and it will increase the likelihood of more taxpayer bailouts.\nSummary of the Republican Substitute to H.R. 4173, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nThis amendment strikes H.R. 4173 in its entirety and substitutes it with eight titles, each described below, which do little or nothing to bring increased accountability and responsibility to Wall Street. The GOP fails to respond to the significant need for consumer protection and financial reform made clear by the current financial crisis. Significantly, the substitute is completely silent on reform to the largest contributor to the crisis: mortgage origination, including no provisions on mortgage reform and predatory lending. It leaves open the hedge fund loophole. It leaves Main Street America vulnerable.\nNo More Bailouts Act\nAmends the bankruptcy code to resolve insolvent non-bank institutions. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to restrict the Fed’s ability to use its emergency authorities under Section 13(3), requires the Treasury Secretary to approve such authority while giving Congress the power to terminate assistance through a joint resolution of disapproval, and requires disclosure of expenditures through the Department of the Treasury.\nDemocratic Analysis: The name of this title should be changed to “Even More Bailouts Act” as it is not structured to prevent the past from happening again. The steepest plunge in financial markets last year was set off by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. The chaos that followed convinced Republicans such as Ben Bernanke, Henry Paulson, and President Bush that the government had to come to the rescue. Title I of H.R. 4173 will prevent the need for future taxpayer-funded bailouts by providing a set of tools to ensure that no critical financial firm grows to the point that it threatens the financial system, the economy, and American jobs. This title also creates an orderly process in the event that a large interconnected firm actually fails. By shutting down the firm, wiping out shareholders, forcing creditors to take a significant hit, this title prevents any failure from endangering the financial system and the overall economy.\nTitle I of the Republican substitute offers an empty tool box to prevent failures, and it ensures that any failure goes through the same bankruptcy process that showed us the danger of financial contagion last year. If the Republicans are so intent on repeating the mistakes of the past, America should be prepared for even more expensive bailouts.\nFinancial Institutions Consumer Protection and Examination Council\nEstablishes a Council of Federal and state regulatory authorities to issue uniform consumer protection rules and examination practices to be adopted and enforced by prudential regulators. State regulators enforce rules on state-regulated institutions. A consumer complaint telephone hotline is created for referral and remedy of consumer complaints. Adds consumer protection to the mission statement of each banking regulator.\nDemocratic Analysis: After ignoring the problems of predatory lending and problems in the mortgage origination process for years, Republicans want to make sure the same regulators that ignored the same problems continue to do so. For example, Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ignored the will of Congress and never implemented the Home Owners Equity Protection Act signed into law in 1994, which would have provided protection from subprime lending. House Republicans never said a word about the Fed’s inaction. After all we have been through with the problems that surfaced in the mortgage origination process and unscrupulous lenders taking advantage of borrowers with no money, income, or collateral, it is hard to believe that Republicans are so intent on repeating the mistakes of the past.\nAnd what happened in May when the House passed the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act to end these abuses and require responsible lending? 114 House Republicans lined up to vote against it.\nAnti-Fraud Provisions\nAttempts to strengthen anti-fraud enforcement by increasing civil and criminal money penalties, maximizing restitution for victims of fraud, improving surveillance of bad actors, and allowing regulators to share information with foreign regulators and enforcement agencies.\nOver-the-Counter Derivative Markets\nDoes not require clearing, or trading on exchange or trade execution platform, for any swaps or security-based swaps. Requires the reporting of uncleared swaps and securities-based swaps to trade repositories or the CFTC or SEC, as appropriate. The repository shall make information available to regulators and disclose swap-related information to the public on an aggregate basis. Directs regulators to impose margin for swap and security-based swap transactions between swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants and major security-based swap participants. Also provides for the segregation of margin. Regulators are to take the swap and security-based swap positions into consideration when determining capital levels for the entities they regulate. After one year, the regulator shall report to Congress on the swap and security-based swap market and make recommendations if they jointly find further regulation of the market is required.\nDemocratic Analysis: Where real reform and regulation are needed to limit potential systemic risk from the $600 trillion swap market, the Republicans offer simple window dressing. Rather than requiring centralized clearing and exchange trading for standardized swaps in order to minimize risk to the financial system, the Republicans would simply have market participants “report” their positions. At the same time, they would pay lip service to clearing by directing the regulators to “set targets” in this area and kick the can down the road by requiring a report back to Congress a year after enactment on the need for further swap market regulation. The Republican substitute would do nothing to prevent another AIG from threatening the financial systems or guard against the chaos in the markets that could follow the bankruptcy of a heavily intertwined swap counterparty like Lehman Brothers.\nCorporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness\nWhile similar to executive compensation provisions in H.R. 4173, the substitute provides for a non-binding shareholder “say on pay” vote only once every three years rather than annually and allows shareholders to vote to opt out of ongoing “say on pay” vote requirements. Further, the substitute allows state laws to preempt the independence requirements it establishes for compensation committees of public companies. Finally, the substitute is markedly dissimilar from the executive compensation provisions in H.R. 4173 in that the substitute includes no provisions to address excessively risky, incentive-based compensation structures that could threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions and have adverse effects on overall financial stability.\nDemocratic Analysis: The Republicans should be given some credit here for agreeing with Democrats. Three years ago, they flatly rejected Democratic requests to hold hearings on the issue of abuses in excessive executive compensation. Now they agree with Democrats. First, they agree with President Obama that compensation committees should be independent. Second, they adopt Barney Frank’s “say on pay” provisions by requiring a shareholder vote on executive compensation.\nBut Republicans leave shareholders holding the bag if and when an executive is hired, given the opportunity to pile on all sorts of short-term risk, make hundreds of millions of dollars, and then leave the company two and half-years later and avoid any responsibility or accountability to the owners of the company.\nCredit Rating Agencies\nChanges the name/meaning of a NRSRO from “Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organization” to “Nationally Registered Statistical Rating Organizations” and removes all references to ratings in Federal law/regulation. Includes none of the improvements in supervision included in H.R. 4173.\nDemocratic Analysis: The fact the credit rating agencies gave out Triple-A ratings to every security or bond that walked in is lost on the Republicans. The poor performance of these entities and their contribution to the crisis mandates the need for tougher regulations to protect America.\nGovernment-Sponsored Enterprises Reform\nPhases out taxpayer subsidies of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and privatizes the entities over a number of years. Sunsets the current conservatorships and places both institutions in receivership if they are not financially viable. If they are viable, requires wind down of agencies if their charters are not renewed in three years. Requires reductions in the portfolios of the two companies, emphasizes the promotion of housing affordability, and requires SEC registration as well as reverses all tax exemptions. Lowers conforming loan limit in high cost areas and prohibits GSEs from buying any loan that is above the area median home price in its area - effectively lowering conforming loan limits in much of the country.\nDemocratic Analysis: Let’s review the pitiful record of Republicans and the GSE. First they ignored the problem for years, having never passed reform legislation for the first 10 years (1995-2005) of Republican rule in the House of Representatives. Second, the only Republican reform bill to ever get a vote in Congress was opposed by a Republican President. Third, President Bush, over the objections of House Democrats, pushed Fannie and Freddie into riskier and riskier mortgages with a philosophy of homeownership at any cost. And finally, President Bush bails them out. When Democrats took over in 2007, Barney Frank worked with the Bush Administration and over the objections of most Republicans in the House passed Fannie and Freddie reform within 5 months of taking over the majority. The only Fannie and Freddie reform bill signed by President Bush was authored by Barney Frank and Chris Dodd.\nRepublicans want you to believe that they are serious about the problems associated with Fannie and Freddie, but it is smoke and mirrors. House Democrats are committed to addressing the Fannie and Freddie issues with substantive, thoughtful reform when Congress convenes next year.\nFederal Insurance Office (FIO)\nFederal Office of Insurance created in substitute is identical to FIO created in H.R. 4173.\n###\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        House Rejects Bailout Bill; Wall Street Shudders\nIn a shocking defeat that rocked Wall Street, the House of Representatives voted down a $700 billion plan aimed at rescuing banks and unfreezing the world's credit markets.\nThe news of the 228-205 defeat sent the stock market reeling. The Dow Jones industrial average recorded its biggest closing point drop in history, closing down 777.68 points — or nearly 7 percent — to 10,365.45.\nTreasury Secretary Henry Paulson spoke to reporters at the White House after a discussion with President Bush aimed at mapping out the way forward. He said he would keep working to get a bill. \"We need to work as quickly as possible,\" Paulson said. \"We need to get something done. We need to put something back together that works.\"\nMarket analysts said Paulson and the Bush administration more generally were at least partially to blame for stirring up the sturm und drang that ended with Monday's stock market plunge.\nThe Bush economic team has been saying for weeks that the financial world as we know it would end if a rescue plan was not put in place in short order. So when the bill failed in the House, investors naturally ran for the closest exits. For all his doom-casting after the vote, Paulson did inject a faint note of confidence. He said the banking system so far \"has been holding up very well, considering all of the pressures.\"\nTrying Again\nPresident Bush, with mere months left in office, had staked what little political capital he has left on passage of the bill. He looked a little shell-shocked after the vote.\n\"I'm disappointed in the vote by the United States Congress on the economic recovery plan,\" the president said from the Oval Office. \"We will work with leaders of Congress on a way forward.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was just as adamant that the vote \"cannot stand.\"\nInstead of adjourning for the year, House leaders say they'll reconvene on Thursday. Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT) said that \"things need to cool down a little bit\" before lawmakers could start resurrecting their financial bailout effort. He said lawmakers needed to settle in and digest what had happened and then move forward. Dodd said he was still confident that Congress would pass a bailout bill in the end.\n\"This is not an easy vote; our constituents are not happy about this and rightfully so,\" said Dodd, predicting that it would take another couple of days to work this out. \"As angry as they may be right now, they are going to get a lot angrier — and they should — if we don't act.\"\nRecriminations On The Hill\nIt took little time for the partisan finger-pointing to start.\nRepublicans said a speech by Pelosi just before the vote led some Republicans to vote against the plan.\nHouse Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio said that when Pelosi blamed \"the Bush administration's failed economic policies\" for the current economic mess, she \"poisoned\" the well. Added Republican Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, \"There's a reason that this vote failed — and that is Speaker Pelosi's speech.\"\nRep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said it wasn't anything Pelosi said. He blamed the Republican side for its lack of coordination. He said Republicans were blaming Pelosi because \"they are covering up the embarrassment of not having the votes.\" Frank said he couldn't imagine any Republican lawmaker would imperil the economy because of something Pelosi might have said. He said he gave Republicans more credit than that.\nThe day began with the expectation that the vote was going to be a squeaker. The president took the unusual step of addressing lawmakers in a statement outside the Oval Office early Monday morning. He urged passage of what he called a \"bold bill\" that will \"keep the crisis in our financial system from spreading throughout the economy.\"\nBush said he knew it would be a tough vote to cast, given that most Americans appear to be against bailing out Wall Street financial firms. But he said the only way out of the current crisis was for the Treasury to take on some of the toxic debt that financial institutions have on their balance sheets. The credit system had frozen up, he said, because of all these bad mortgages on the books.\nThe president did more than just speak to cameras outside the White House. He also called lawmakers before the vote, trying to persuade fence sitters to support the bill, according to White House spokesman Tony Fratto. Clearly, the president's words and lobbying efforts didn't do the trick. By early afternoon, the bill had gone down in flames and the markets went into free fall.\nRepublican presidential nominee John McCain said it was time to \"get back to the drawing board.\" It is unclear whether he thought they should work on a completely new plan or whether he thought they could tinker at the edges of the current one. McCain said that now was not a good time to assign blame, but that instead, lawmakers needed to focus on fixing the problem.\nA Changed Proposal\nEven members on the Hill seemed shocked by the bill's failure. Minutes after the vote tally, leaders on both sides of the aisle tried to convert naysayers to put the bill over the top. They even postponed closing the vote in hopes of getting 10 people to change their minds. In the end, after a 40-minute delay, they found only two lawmakers willing to switch their votes.\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) gave voice to what many lawmakers were saying more privately. \"We're all worried about losing our jobs,\" he said, noting that the vote took place just weeks before all 435 House members face re-election. \"Most of us say, 'I want this thing to pass, but I want you to vote for it, not me.' \"\nThe final 110-page bill was a far cry from the no-strings-attached bill that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson had offered Congress just a week ago. The administration ended up accepting limits on executive pay for those who take advantage of the bailout and more oversight of the Treasury's implementation of the bailout plan.\nDemocrats had wanted bankruptcy judges to be able to rewrite mortgages for homeowners who bit off more mortgage than they could swallow, but that provision was not in the final legislation. Republicans wanted the federal government to insure, rather than buy, the debt. That program did make it to the final bill, but it is optional.\nWith contributions by NPR staff and wire reports\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Tight House races feel bailout fallout\n— -- Political drama over the $700 billion Wall Street bailout began seeping into the nation's most competitive House races Tuesday as candidates tried to measure public reaction to the bill's fate.\nRepublican challengers criticized a handful of Democrats in close races who voted for the bailout measure, injecting a new wrinkle in an election year when Democrats hope to expand their House and Senate majorities.\n\"This crisis and the way it's been handled is another example of how Washington has changed Dennis Moore more than Dennis Moore has changed Washington,\" Republican candidate Nick Jordan said of his opponent, a Kansas Democrat who voted for the bill.\nJordan, who held a news conference in Mission, Kan., to discuss the bailout vote, is locked in a tight race with Moore, according to the non-partisan Cook Political Report. In a statement, Moore said, \"I voted for this bipartisan compromise because it took the necessary steps to protect American taxpayers.\"\nMost House incumbents in close races voted against the bill that even supporters acknowledged was unpopular. Of 37 Republicans in races that Cook has identified as competitive, 32 voted against the bill. Of 29 endangered Democrats, 18 voted no.\nNathan Gonzales, political editor at the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report, said many candidates are waiting to see the debate develop before taking hard positions on the campaign trail. President Bush and congressional leaders are working toward a compromise.\n\"We don't know what the fallout will be on Election Day,\" said Gonzales, adding he believes Democrats will pick up seats on Nov. 4. \"All the members are trying to balance doing the right thing vs. doing nothing.\"\nCandidates raised the issue Tuesday, but rhetoric was cautious as lawmakers continued to negotiate.\nNevada state Sen. Dina Titus, a Democrat, is running against GOP incumbent U.S. Rep. Jon Porter, who voted for the bill. Titus said Porter's past votes helped lead to the recent financial meltdown.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

Our democratic principles require that the American people be informed of the activities of their Government. Also, our Nation's progress depends on the free flow of information both within the Government and to the American people. Nevertheless, throughout our history, the national defense has required that certain information be maintained in confidence in order to protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, our homeland security, and our interactions with foreign nations. Protecting information critical to our Nation's security and demonstrating our commitment to open Government through accurate and accountable application of classification standards and routine, secure, and effective declassification are equally important priorities.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nPART 1 -- ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION\nSection 1.1. Classification Standards. (a) Information may be originally classified under the terms of this order only if all of the following conditions are met:\n(1) an original classification authority is classifying the information;\n(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United States Government;\n(3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of information listed in section 1.4 of this order; and\n(4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security, which includes defense against transnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able to identify or describe the damage.\n(b) If there is significant doubt about the need to classify information, it shall not be classified. This provision does not:\n(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification; or\n(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.\n(c) Classified information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information.\n(d) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information is presumed to cause damage to the national security.\nSec. 1.2. Classification Levels. (a) Information may be classified at one of the following three levels:\n(1) \"Top Secret\" shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.\n(2) \"Secret\" shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.\n(3) \"Confidential\" shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.\n(b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall be used to identify United States classified information.\n(c) If there is significant doubt about the appropriate level of classification, it shall be classified at the lower level.\nSec. 1.3. Classification Authority. (a) The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by:\n(1) the President and the Vice President;\n(2) agency heads and officials designated by the President; and\n(3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.\n(b) Officials authorized to classify information at a specified level are also authorized to classify information at a lower level.\n(c) Delegation of original classification authority.\n(1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to the minimum required to administer this order. Agency heads are responsible for ensuring that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and continuing need to exercise this authority.\n(2) \"Top Secret\" original classification authority may be delegated only by the President, the Vice President, or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n(3) \"Secret\" or \"Confidential\" original classification authority may be delegated only by the President, the Vice President, an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4(d) of this order, provided that official has been delegated \"Top Secret\" original classification authority by the agency head.\n(4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be in writing and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in this order. Each delegation shall identify the official by name or position.\n(5) Delegations of original classification authority shall be reported or made available by name or position to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.\n(d) All original classification authorities must receive training in proper classification (including the avoidance of over-classification) and declassification as provided in this order and its implementing directives at least once a calendar year. Such training must include instruction on the proper safeguarding of classified information and on the sanctions in section 5.5 of this order that may be brought against an individual who fails to classify information properly or protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure. Original classification authorities who do not receive such mandatory training at least once within a calendar year shall have their classification authority suspended by the agency head or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4(d) of this order until such training has taken place. A waiver may be granted by the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official if an individual is unable to receive such training due to unavoidable circumstances. Whenever a waiver is granted, the individual shall receive such training as soon as practicable.\n(e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of an agency who does not have original classification authority originates information believed by that person to require classification, the information shall be protected in a manner consistent with this order and its implementing directives. The information shall be transmitted promptly as provided under this order or its implementing directives to the agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority with respect to this information. That agency shall decide within 30 days whether to classify this information.\nSec. 1.4. Classification Categories. Information shall not be considered for classification unless its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security in accordance with section 1.2 of this order, and it pertains to one or more of the following:\n(a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations;\n(b) foreign government information;\n(c) intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;\n(d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources;\n(e) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security;\n(f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;\n(g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the national security; or\n(h) the development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction.\nSec. 1.5. Duration of Classification. (a) At the time of original classification, the original classification authority shall establish a specific date or event for declassification based on the duration of the national security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date or event, the information shall be automatically declassified. Except for information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the date or event shall not exceed the time frame established in paragraph (b) of this section.\n(b) If the original classification authority cannot determine an earlier specific date or event for declassification, information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original decision.\n(c) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification up to 25 years from the date of origin of the document, change the level of classification, or reclassify specific information only when the standards and procedures for classifying information under this order are followed.\n(d) No information may remain classified indefinitely. Information marked for an indefinite duration of classification under predecessor orders, for example, marked as \"Originating Agency's Determination Required,\" or classified information that contains incomplete declassification instructions or lacks declassification instructions shall be declassified in accordance with part 3 of this order.\nSec. 1.6. Identification and Markings. (a) At the time of original classification, the following shall be indicated in a manner that is immediately apparent:\n(1) one of the three classification levels defined in section 1.2 of this order;\n(2) the identity, by name and position, or by personal identifier, of the original classification authority;\n(3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise evident;\n(4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate one of the following:\n(A) the date or event for declassification, as prescribed in section 1.5(a);\n(B) the date that is 10 years from the date of original classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b);\n(C) the date that is up to 25 years from the date of original classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); or\n(D) in the case of information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the marking prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this order; and\n(5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the applicable classification categories in section 1.4 of this order.\n(b) Specific information required in paragraph (a) of this section may be excluded if it would reveal additional classified information.\n(c) With respect to each classified document, the agency originating the document shall, by marking or other means, indicate which portions are classified, with the applicable classification level, and which portions are unclassified. In accordance with standards prescribed in directives issued under this order, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office may grant and revoke temporary waivers of this requirement. The Director shall revoke any waiver upon a finding of abuse.\n(d) Markings or other indicia implementing the provisions of this order, including abbreviations and requirements to safeguard classified working papers, shall conform to the standards prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this order.\n(e) Foreign government information shall retain its original classification markings or shall be assigned a U.S. classification that provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the entity that furnished the information. Foreign government information retaining its original classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. classification marking provided that the responsible agency determines that the foreign government markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings.\n(f) Information assigned a level of classification under this or predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings. Whenever such information is used in the derivative classification process or is reviewed for possible declassification, holders of such information shall coordinate with an appropriate classification authority for the application of omitted markings.\n(g) The classification authority shall, whenever practicable, use a classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product to allow for dissemination at the lowest level of classification possible or in unclassified form.\n(h) Prior to public release, all declassified records shall be appropriately marked to reflect their declassification.\nSec. 1.7. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.\n(a) In no case shall information be classified, continue to be maintained as classified, or fail to be declassified in order to:\n(1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;\n(2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;\n(3) restrain competition; or\n(4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security.\n(b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the national security shall not be classified.\n(c) Information may not be reclassified after declassification and release to the public under proper authority unless:\n(1) the reclassification is personally approved in writing by the agency head based on a document-by-document determination by the agency that reclassification is required to prevent significant and demonstrable damage to the national security;\n(2) the information may be reasonably recovered without bringing undue attention to the information;\n(3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office; and\n(4) for documents in the physical and legal custody of the National Archives and Records Administration (National Archives) that have been available for public use, the agency head has, after making the determinations required by this paragraph, notified the Archivist of the United States (Archivist), who shall suspend public access pending approval of the reclassification action by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed by the agency head to the President through the National Security Advisor. Public access shall remain suspended pending a prompt decision on the appeal.\n(d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2204(c)(1), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section 3.5 of this order only if such classification meets the requirements of this order and is accomplished on a document-by-document basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4 of this order. The requirements in this paragraph also apply to those situations in which information has been declassified in accordance with a specific date or event determined by an original classification authority in accordance with section 1.5 of this order.\n(e) Compilations of items of information that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the standards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information.\nSec. 1.8. Classification Challenges. (a) Authorized holders of information who, in good faith, believe that its classification status is improper are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification status of the information in accordance with agency procedures established under paragraph (b) of this section.\n(b) In accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant to this order, an agency head or senior agency official shall establish procedures under which authorized holders of information, including authorized holders outside the classifying agency, are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification of information that they believe is improperly classified or unclassified. These procedures shall ensure that:\n(1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such actions;\n(2) an opportunity is provided for review by an impartial official or panel; and\n(3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal agency decisions to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (Panel) established by section 5.3 of this order.\n(c) Documents required to be submitted for prepublication review or other administrative process pursuant to an approved nondisclosure agreement are not covered by this section.\nSec. 1.9. Fundamental Classification Guidance Review.\n(a) Agency heads shall complete on a periodic basis a comprehensive review of the agency's classification guidance, particularly classification guides, to ensure the guidance reflects current circumstances and to identify classified information that no longer requires protection and can be declassified. The initial fundamental classification guidance review shall be completed within 2 years of the effective date of this order.\n(b) The classification guidance review shall include an evaluation of classified information to determine if it meets the standards for classification under section 1.4 of this order, taking into account an up-to-date assessment of likely damage as described under section 1.2 of this order.\n(c) The classification guidance review shall include original classification authorities and agency subject matter experts to ensure a broad range of perspectives.\n(d) Agency heads shall provide a report summarizing the results of the classification guidance review to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office and shall release an unclassified version of this report to the public.\nPART 2 -- DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION\nSec. 2.1. Use of Derivative Classification. (a) Persons who reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide, need not possess original classification authority.\n(b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:\n(1) be identified by name and position, or by personal identifier, in a manner that is immediately apparent for each derivative classification action;\n(2) observe and respect original classification decisions; and\n(3) carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent classification markings. For information derivatively classified based on multiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward:\n(A) the date or event for declassification that corresponds to the longest period of classification among the sources, or the marking established pursuant to section 1.6(a)(4)(D) of this order; and\n(B) a listing of the source materials.\n(c) Derivative classifiers shall, whenever practicable, use a classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product to allow for dissemination at the lowest level of classification possible or in unclassified form.\n(d) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall receive training in the proper application of the derivative classification principles of the order, with an emphasis on avoiding over-classification, at least once every 2 years. Derivative classifiers who do not receive such training at least once every 2 years shall have their authority to apply derivative classification markings suspended until they have received such training. A waiver may be granted by the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official if an individual is unable to receive such training due to unavoidable circumstances. Whenever a waiver is granted, the individual shall receive such training as soon as practicable.\nSec. 2.2. Classification Guides. (a) Agencies with original classification authority shall prepare classification guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification of information. These guides shall conform to standards contained in directives issued under this order.\n(b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in writing by an official who:\n(1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or is the senior agency official; and\n(2) is authorized to classify information originally at the highest level of classification prescribed in the guide.\n(c) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure that classification guides are reviewed and updated as provided in directives issued under this order.\n(d) Agencies shall incorporate original classification decisions into classification guides on a timely basis and in accordance with directives issued under this order.\n(e) Agencies may incorporate exemptions from automatic declassification approved pursuant to section 3.3(j) of this order into classification guides, provided that the Panel is notified of the intent to take such action for specific information in advance of approval and the information remains in active use.\n(f) The duration of classification of a document classified by a derivative classifier using a classification guide shall not exceed 25 years from the date of the origin of the document, except for:\n(1) information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction; and\n(2) specific information incorporated into classification guides in accordance with section 2.2(e) of this order.\nPART 3 -- DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING\nSec. 3.1. Authority for Declassification. (a) Information shall be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for classification under this order.\n(b) Information shall be declassified or downgraded by:\n(1) the official who authorized the original classification, if that official is still serving in the same position and has original classification authority;\n(2) the originator's current successor in function, if that individual has original classification authority;\n(3) a supervisory official of either the originator or his or her successor in function, if the supervisory official has original classification authority; or\n(4) officials delegated declassification authority in writing by the agency head or the senior agency official of the originating agency.\n(c) The Director of National Intelligence (or, if delegated by the Director of National Intelligence, the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence) may, with respect to the Intelligence Community, after consultation with the head of the originating Intelligence Community element or department, declassify, downgrade, or direct the declassification or downgrading of information or intelligence relating to intelligence sources, methods, or activities.\n(d) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the classification requirements under this order requires continued protection. In some exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or the senior agency official. That official will determine, as an exercise of discretion, whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to the national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure. This provision does not:\n(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification; or\n(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.\n(e) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office determines that information is classified in violation of this order, the Director may require the information to be declassified by the agency that originated the classification. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed to the President through the National Security Advisor. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal.\n(f) The provisions of this section shall also apply to agencies that, under the terms of this order, do not have original classification authority, but had such authority under predecessor orders.\n(g) No information may be excluded from declassification under section 3.3 of this order based solely on the type of document or record in which it is found. Rather, the classified information must be considered on the basis of its content.\n(h) Classified nonrecord materials, including artifacts, shall be declassified as soon as they no longer meet the standards for classification under this order.\n(i) When making decisions under sections 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 of this order, agencies shall consider the final decisions of the Panel.\nSec. 3.2. Transferred Records. (a) In the case of classified records transferred in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not merely for storage purposes, the receiving agency shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order.\n(b) In the case of classified records that are not officially transferred as described in paragraph (a) of this section, but that originated in an agency that has ceased to exist and for which there is no successor agency, each agency in possession of such records shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order. Such records may be declassified or downgraded by the agency in possession of the records after consultation with any other agency that has an interest in the subject matter of the records.\n(c) Classified records accessioned into the National Archives shall be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist in accordance with this order, the directives issued pursuant to this order, agency declassification guides, and any existing procedural agreement between the Archivist and the relevant agency head.\n(d) The originating agency shall take all reasonable steps to declassify classified information contained in records determined to have permanent historical value before they are accessioned into the National Archives. However, the Archivist may require that classified records be accessioned into the National Archives when necessary to comply with the provisions of the Federal Records Act. This provision does not apply to records transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 2203 of title 44, United States Code, or records for which the National Archives serves as the custodian of the records of an agency or organization that has gone out of existence.\n(e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt a system of records management that will facilitate the public release of documents at the time such documents are declassified pursuant to the provisions for automatic declassification in section 3.3 of this order.\nSec. 3.3. Automatic Declassification. (a) Subject to paragraphs (b)–(d) and (g)–(j) of this section, all classified records that (1) are more than 25 years old and (2) have been determined to have permanent historical value under title 44, United States Code, shall be automatically declassified whether or not the records have been reviewed. All classified records shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of origin, except as provided in paragraphs (b)–(d) and (g)–(i) of this section. If the date of origin of an individual record cannot be readily determined, the date of original classification shall be used instead.\n(b) An agency head may exempt from automatic declassification under paragraph (a) of this section specific information, the release of which should clearly and demonstrably be expected to:\n(1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, a human intelligence source, a relationship with an intelligence or security service of a foreign government or international organization, or a nonhuman intelligence source; or impair the effectiveness of an intelligence method currently in use, available for use, or under development;\n(2) reveal information that would assist in the development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction;\n(3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or activities;\n(4) reveal information that would impair the application of state-of-the-art technology within a U.S. weapon system;\n(5) reveal formally named or numbered U.S. military war plans that remain in effect, or reveal operational or tactical elements of prior plans that are contained in such active plans;\n(6) reveal information, including foreign government information, that would cause serious harm to relations between the United States and a foreign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States;\n(7) reveal information that would impair the current ability of United States Government officials to protect the President, Vice President, and other protectees for whom protection services, in the interest of the national security, are authorized;\n(8) reveal information that would seriously impair current national security emergency preparedness plans or reveal current vulnerabilities of systems, installations, or infrastructures relating to the national security; or\n(9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement that does not permit the automatic or unilateral declassification of information at 25 years.\n(c)(1) An agency head shall notify the Panel of any specific file series of records for which a review or assessment has determined that the information within that file series almost invariably falls within one or more of the exemption categories listed in paragraph (b) of this section and that the agency proposes to exempt from automatic declassification at 25 years.\n(2) The notification shall include:\n(A) a description of the file series;\n(B) an explanation of why the information within the file series is almost invariably exempt from automatic declassification and why the information must remain classified for a longer period of time; and\n(C) except when the information within the file series almost invariably identifies a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, a specific date or event for declassification of the information, not to exceed December 31 of the year that is 50 years from the date of origin of the records.\n(3) The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt a designated file series or to declassify the information within that series at an earlier date than recommended. The agency head may appeal such a decision to the President through the National Security Advisor.\n(4) File series exemptions approved by the President prior to December 31, 2008, shall remain valid without any additional agency action pending Panel review by the later of December 31, 2010, or December 31 of the year that is 10 years from the date of previous approval.\n(d) The following provisions shall apply to the onset of automatic declassification:\n(1) Classified records within an integral file block, as defined in this order, that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under this section shall not be automatically declassified until December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the file block.\n(2) After consultation with the Director of the National Declassification Center (the Center) established by section 3.7 of this order and before the records are subject to automatic declassification, an agency head or senior agency official may delay automatic declassification for up to five additional years for classified information contained in media that make a review for possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly.\n(3) Other than for records that are properly exempted from automatic declassification, records containing classified information that originated with other agencies or the disclosure of which would affect the interests or activities of other agencies with respect to the classified information and could reasonably be expected to fall under one or more of the exemptions in paragraph (b) of this section shall be identified prior to the onset of automatic declassification for later referral to those agencies.\n(A) The information of concern shall be referred by the Center established by section 3.7 of this order, or by the centralized facilities referred to in section 3.7(e) of this order, in a prioritized and scheduled manner determined by the Center.\n(B) If an agency fails to provide a final determination on a referral made by the Center within 1 year of referral, or by the centralized facilities referred to in section 3.7(e) of this order within 3 years of referral, its equities in the referred records shall be automatically declassified.\n(C) If any disagreement arises between affected agencies and the Center regarding the referral review period, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office shall determine the appropriate period of review of referred records.\n(D) Referrals identified prior to the establishment of the Center by section 3.7 of this order shall be subject to automatic declassification only in accordance with subparagraphs (d)(3)(A)–(C) of this section.\n(4) After consultation with the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, an agency head may delay automatic declassification for up to 3 years from the date of discovery of classified records that were inadvertently not reviewed prior to the effective date of automatic declassification.\n(e) Information exempted from automatic declassification under this section shall remain subject to the mandatory and systematic declassification review provisions of this order.\n(f) The Secretary of State shall determine when the United States should commence negotiations with the appropriate officials of a foreign government or international organization of governments to modify any treaty or international agreement that requires the classification of information contained in records affected by this section for a period longer than 25 years from the date of its creation, unless the treaty or international agreement pertains to information that may otherwise remain classified beyond 25 years under this section.\n(g) The Secretary of Energy shall determine when information concerning foreign nuclear programs that was removed from the Restricted Data category in order to carry out provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, may be declassified.

An agency head may appeal such a decision to the President through the National Security Advisor. The information will remain classified while such an appeal is pending.\n(k) For information in a file series of records determined not to have permanent historical value, the duration of classification beyond 25 years shall be the same as the disposition (destruction) date of those records in each Agency Records Control Schedule or General Records Schedule, although the duration of classification shall be extended if the record has been retained for business reasons beyond the scheduled disposition date.\nSec. 3.4. Systematic Declassification Review. (a) Each agency that has originated classified information under this order or its predecessors shall establish and conduct a program for systematic declassification review for records of permanent historical value exempted from automatic declassification under section 3.3 of this order. Agencies shall prioritize their review of such records in accordance with priorities established by the Center.\n(b) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic declassification review program for classified records: (1) accessioned into the National Archives; (2) transferred to the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2203; and (3) for which the National Archives serves as the custodian for an agency or organization that has gone out of existence.\nSec. 3.5. Mandatory Declassification Review. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all information classified under this order or predecessor orders shall be subject to a review for declassification by the originating agency if:\n(1) the request for a review describes the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort;\n(2) the document or material containing the information responsive to the request is not contained within an operational file exempted from search and review, publication, and disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 in accordance with law; and\n(3) the information is not the subject of pending litigation.\n(b) Information originated by the incumbent President or the incumbent Vice President; the incumbent President's White House Staff or the incumbent Vice President's Staff; committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the incumbent President; or other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the incumbent President is exempted from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

Review procedures developed by the Archivist shall provide for consultation with agencies having primary subject matter interest and shall be consistent with the provisions of applicable laws or lawful agreements that pertain to the respective Presidential papers or records. Agencies with primary subject matter interest shall be notified promptly of the Archivist's decision. Any final decision by the Archivist may be appealed by the requester or an agency to the Panel. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal.\n(c) Agencies conducting a mandatory review for declassification shall declassify information that no longer meets the standards for classification under this order. They shall release this information unless withholding is otherwise authorized and warranted under applicable law.\n(d) If an agency has reviewed the requested information for declassification within the past 2 years, the agency need not conduct another review and may instead inform the requester of this fact and the prior review decision and advise the requester of appeal rights provided under subsection (e) of this section.\n(e) In accordance with directives issued pursuant to this order, agency heads shall develop procedures to process requests for the mandatory review of classified information. These procedures shall apply to information classified under this or predecessor orders. They also shall provide a means for administratively appealing a denial of a mandatory review request, and for notifying the requester of the right to appeal a final agency decision to the Panel.\n(f) After consultation with affected agencies, the Secretary of Defense shall develop special procedures for the review of cryptologic information; the Director of National Intelligence shall develop special procedures for the review of information pertaining to intelligence sources, methods, and activities; and the Archivist shall develop special procedures for the review of information accessioned into the National Archives.\n(g) Documents required to be submitted for prepublication review or other administrative process pursuant to an approved nondisclosure agreement are not covered by this section.\n(h) This section shall not apply to any request for a review made to an element of the Intelligence Community that is made by a person other than an individual as that term is defined by 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(2), or by a foreign government entity or any representative thereof.\nSec. 3.6.

Such actions shall be taken only in accordance with directives implementing this order and any procedure issued by agencies governing the classified information, which shall be designed to minimize the classified information that is disclosed under these circumstances and the number of individuals who receive it. Information disclosed under this provision or implementing directives and procedures shall not be deemed declassified as a result of such disclosure or subsequent use by a recipient. Such disclosures shall be reported promptly to the originator of the classified information. For purposes of this section, the Director of National Intelligence may issue an implementing directive governing the emergency disclosure of classified intelligence information.\n(c) Each agency shall update, at least annually, the automatic, routine, or recurring distribution mechanism for classified information that it distributes. Recipients shall cooperate fully with distributors who are updating distribution lists and shall notify distributors whenever a relevant change in status occurs.\nSec. 4.3. Special Access Programs.

Unless otherwise authorized by the President, only the Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, or the principal deputy of each, may create a special access program. For special access programs pertaining to intelligence sources, methods, and activities (but not including military operational, strategic, and tactical programs), this function shall be exercised by the Director of National Intelligence. These officials shall keep the number of these programs at an absolute minimum, and shall establish them only when the program is required by statute or upon a specific finding that:\n(1) the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is exceptional; and\n(2) the normal criteria for determining eligibility for access applicable to information classified at the same level are not deemed sufficient to protect the information from unauthorized disclosure.\n(b) Requirements and limitations. (1) Special access programs shall be limited to programs in which the number of persons who ordinarily will have access will be reasonably small and commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection for the information involved.\n(2) Each agency head shall establish and maintain a system of accounting for special access programs consistent with directives issued pursuant to this order.\n(3) Special access programs shall be subject to the oversight program established under section 5.4(d) of this order. In addition, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office shall be afforded access to these programs, in accordance with the security requirements of each program, in order to perform the functions assigned to the Information Security Oversight Office under this order.

Here is another law that separates citizens from the President.\nNew law makes it illegal to protest in Obama’s presence (or whomever he chooses)\nThis means that, wherever Obama is at, you do not have a right to ask him anything you want to. His secret service can have you arrested, fined, and imprisoned for more than a YEAR if you ask him something he doesn’t like. Sound like he’s more like Hitler than Lincoln to you?\nWATCH AND BE AMAZED AT HIS LATEST ATTEMPT TO STAGE A TAKE OVER OF AMERICA…\nClick on the link below:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=7SGWH3kirzg&vq=medium\nFULL ANSWER\nWe have received numerous inquiries about HR 347, the “Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011,” but many of the claims made in this email and elsewhere are simply untrue.\nThe law merely updates a measure that has been on the books since it was signed by then-President Richard Nixon in 1971, making it a federal crime to trespass on grounds secured by the Secret Service. No new penalties were added, and the bill was not signed “secretly” as some claim. The White House announced the signing publicly just as it does for other such routine measures.\nManufactured Controversy\nThis was about as routine and noncontroversial as a federal law can get, at least until false claims started to circulate, drumming up a manufactured controversy. The law was sponsored by a Republican, Rep. Thomas Rooney of Florida. In fact, the bill has been around for years. Rooney first introduced it in 2009 and spoke about it on the House floor in 2010. The current Congress passed it overwhelmingly — by “unanimous consent” in the Senate, and with only three House members voting against it.\nIt merely amended Title 18, Chapter 84, Section 1752 of the U.S. Code — just as then-President George W. Bush did in 2006 when he signed the Patriot Act. (Click on the link to the U.S. Code and you can see how it was amended in 1982, 1984, 1994 and 2006.)\nAccording to the official report of the full House Judiciary Committee (which approved it on a voice vote, without recorded opposition), the bill adds two things to previously existing law:\n- It specifies that it is unlawful to enter secured areas of the White House and its grounds, or the vice president’s official residence and grounds. Previously, according to the report, the law prohibited unlawful entry to any building or ground, secured by the Secret Service, where the president or vice president is “temporarily” visiting. That forced the Secret Service to rely on a District of Columbia law that “addresses only minor misdemeanor infractions” even if somebody were to breach the White House residence itself.\n- The new law revises the standard that prosecutors must meet to gain a conviction, from proving that a violation was committed “willfully and knowingly” to merely proving that it was committed “knowingly.”\nThe bill reached the House floor on Feb. 28, 2011, but not a single member spoke out against it during the seven minutes of debate. The House then passed it by a vote of 399 to 3. Only Reps. Ron Paul of Texas, Justin Amash of Michigan and Paul Broun of Georgia, all Republicans, voted against it. The Senate didn’t take it up until nearly a year later, when it reached the floor on Feb. 6, 2012. With no debate whatsoever, the Senate passed a slightly amended version by “unanimous consent,” meaning that not a single senator voiced any opposition.\nThe Senate version reached the House floor a few days later, Feb. 27. Once again nobody spoke against the measure during another very brief debate, which lasted eight minutes. The House vote this time was 388 to 3, but those voting against included a liberal Democrat — Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Ellison had voted for the measure the first time. His switch brought to four the total number of House members who had voted against the measure during either House vote. (Paul was absent this time.)\nObama signed the measure into law March 8. But he didn’t do it in secret, as critics would later claim. There was no public ceremony, of the sort reserved for major pieces of legislation. But like most routine and noncontroversial measures, this one was signed in private and then announced publicly through an official White House statement.\nBogus Claims\nSo how did such an innocuous measure come to be described as an assault on the First Amendment and a criminalizing of any protest against Barack Obama? The emails we have seen usually include a link to a video of a Fox News’ report criticizing the law as an unprecedented attack on free speech, and claiming that the law makes it a crime to protest and imposes stiff new penalties — including making it a felony for merely asking Obama a question he doesn’t like or protesting peacefully in his presence.\nAll those claims are bogus.\nAs we’ve seen, the law has been around since Richard Nixon’s time, and the changes Congress approved don’t impose new penalties or even address the issues of speech or protest.\nThe Fox News report, for example, claimed that the new law makes it a felony to protest against the president, and the emails circulating about it say you can be put in prison “for more than a YEAR if you ask him something he [Obama] doesn’t like.” But even before the law was amended this year, it provided for penalties of up to 10 years — if the person in a restricted area carries a deadly weapon or causes “significant bodily injury.” Nothing new.\nSome civil libertarians do see a danger that the law can be abused — but that was true before and is also nothing new. Gabe Rottman, a lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote a blog post in response to some of the wild claims that have been made about the new law.\nWe should note here that the ACLU vigorously defends the rights of protesters, even to the point of famously supporting the right of a Nazi group to parade in Skokie, Ill., in 1978.\nRottman wrote that the bill “slightly rewrites” the existing trespass law and that “contrary to some reports” the bill “doesn’t create any new crimes.” The only change that the ACLU’s Rottman found “noteworthy” is that the new law makes it somewhat less difficult for a prosecutor to convict somebody of trespassing where the Secret Service has established security, and he said the ACLU would be alert for “any abuse or misuse.”\nNew Legal Standard\nUnder the 2006 law, it would have been a crime if someone “willfully and knowingly” entered an area restricted by the Secret Service. Now that has been changed to just “knowingly.” Rottman says that “may make it easier for the Secret Service to overuse or misuse the statute to arrest lawful protesters.”\nRottman, March 8: Without getting too much into the weeds, most crimes require the government to prove a certain state of mind. Under the original language of the law, you had to act “willfully and knowingly” when committing the crime. In short, you had to know your conduct was illegal. Under H.R. 347, you will simply need to act “knowingly,” which here would mean that you know you’re in a restricted area, but not necessarily that you’re committing a crime.\nAny time the government lowers the intent requirement, it makes it easier for a prosecutor to prove her case, and it gives law enforcement more discretion when enforcing the law. To be sure, this is of concern to the ACLU. We will monitor the implementation of H.R. 347 for any abuse or misuse.\nIn an interview, Rottman also expressed concern about “undefined phrases” in the law — such as “disorderly or disruptive conduct.” He said, “What exactly is ‘disruptive’? Undefined phrases can be problematic when applying the law.”\nBut the 2006 version of the law contained the same undefined phrases:\n- The 2006 version says it is unlawful for a person or group to “willfully, knowingly, and with intent to impede or disrupt the orderly conduct of Government business or official functions, to engage in disorderly or disruptive conduct in, or within such proximity to, any building or grounds.”\n- The 2012 version says it is unlawful if someone “knowingly, and with intent to impede or disrupt the orderly conduct of Government business or official functions, engages in disorderly or disruptive conduct in, or within such proximity to, any restricted building or grounds when, or so that, such conduct, in fact, impedes or disrupts the orderly conduct of Government business or official functions.”\nOne last thing: Critics of the president are using the law to scare people into thinking that the law will be used against his critics. Maybe it will be. But the law doesn’t cover just the president and vice president and it hasn’t since it was amended in 1982. It covers anyone under Secret Service protection, including past presidents of both parties and the Republican presidential and vice presidential nominees.\nSo, to recap: The law isn’t new; it merely amends existing law. The law doesn’t impose new penalties, although the ACLU is concerned that it may make it easier for the government to prove its case against someone who knowingly enters a restricted area or causes a disturbance in areas under Secret Service protection. The law doesn’t criminalize free speech any more than it did when Bush revised the same law in 2006.\n— Eugene Kiely and Brooks Jackson\nSources\nU.S. House. “H.R. 347, Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011.” 3 Jan 2012.\nU.S. House.

EST\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:\nTonight marks the eighth year that I’ve come here to report on the State of the Union. And for this final one, I’m going to try to make it a little shorter. (Applause.) I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa. (Laughter.) I've been there. I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips. (Laughter.)\nAnd I understand that because it’s an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low. But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform -- (applause) -- and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. (Applause.) So, who knows, we might surprise the cynics again.\nBut tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don’t worry, I’ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done. Fixing a broken immigration system. (Applause.) Protecting our kids from gun violence. (Applause.) Equal pay for equal work. (Applause.) Paid leave. (Applause.) Raising the minimum wage. (Applause.) All these things still matter to hardworking families. They’re still the right thing to do. And I won't let up until they get done.\nBut for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to just talk about next year. I want to focus on the next five years, the next 10 years, and beyond. I want to focus on our future.\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change -- change that’s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. It’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It’s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.\nAmerica has been through big changes before -- wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change; who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the “dogmas of the quiet past.” Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did -- because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril -- we emerged stronger and better than before.\nWhat was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation -- our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law -- these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.\nIn fact, it’s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible. It’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. It’s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.\nBut such progress is not inevitable. It’s the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, in the incredible things that we can do together?\nSo let’s talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer -- regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.\nFirst, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? (Applause.)\nSecond, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us -- especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? (Applause.)\nThird, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman? (Applause.)\nAnd finally, how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us, and not what’s worst?\nLet me start with the economy, and a basic fact: The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. (Applause.) We’re in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history. (Applause.) More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘90s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. (Applause.) That's just part of a manufacturing surge that's created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters. (Applause.)\nAnyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. (Applause.) Now, what is true -- and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious -- is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit; changes that have not let up.\nToday, technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.\nAll these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing. It’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.\nFor the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody. We’ve made progress. But we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that we’ve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.\nWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and -- (applause) -- offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids. (Applause.)\nAnd we have to make college affordable for every American. (Applause.) No hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We’ve already reduced student loan payments to 10 percent of a borrower’s income. And that's good. But now, we’ve actually got to cut the cost of college. (Applause.) Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I’m going to keep fighting to get that started this year. (Applause.) It's the right thing to do. (Applause.)\nBut a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. It’s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber. (Laughter.) For everyone else, especially folks in their 40s and 50s, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool and they may have to retrain. But they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already worked so hard to build in the process.\nThat’s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever. We shouldn’t weaken them; we should strengthen them. (Applause.) And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It’s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business, you’ll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far. (Applause.) And in the process, health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.\nNow, I’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon. (Applause.) A little applause right there. (Laughter.) Just a guess. But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job -- we shouldn’t just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him. If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he’s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That’s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up. And I’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children. (Applause.)\nBut there are some areas where we just have to be honest -- it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years. And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. (Applause.) And it's an honest disagreement, and the American people have a choice to make.\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is red tape that needs to be cut. (Applause.) There you go! Yes! (Applause.) But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else’s expense. (Applause.) Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. (Applause.) Immigrants aren’t the principal reason wages haven’t gone up; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. (Applause.)\nThe point is, I believe that in this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. (Applause.) And I'm not alone in this. This year I plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders. (Applause.) And I want to spread those best practices across America. That's part of a brighter future. (Applause.)\nIn fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?\nSixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there. (Laughter.) We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight. And 12 years later, we were walking on the moon. (Applause.)\nNow, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better world. (Applause.) That's who we are.\nAnd over the past seven years, we’ve nurtured that spirit. We’ve protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. (Applause.) We’ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more.\nLast year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they’ve had in over a decade. (Applause.) So tonight, I’m announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he’s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I’m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. (Applause.) For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the families that we can still save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. (Applause.)\nMedical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. (Applause.) Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You will be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it. (Applause.)\nBut even if -- even if the planet wasn’t at stake, even if 2014 wasn’t the warmest year on record -- until 2015 turned out to be even hotter -- why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future? (Applause.)\nListen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal -- in jobs that pay better than average. We’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy -- something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth. (Applause.)\nGas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad, either. (Applause.)\nNow we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future -- especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don't show them where the trends are going. That’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities, and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system. (Applause.)\nNow, none of this is going to happen overnight. And, yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we’ll create, the money we’ll save, the planet we’ll preserve -- that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve. And it's within our grasp.\nClimate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that’s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.\nI told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. (Applause.) Period. It’s not even close. It's not even close. (Applause.) It's not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. (Applause.) No nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that’s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead -- they call us. (Applause.)\nI mean, it's useful to level the set here, because when we don't, we don't make good decisions.\nNow, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that’s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and certainly not because of diminished American strength. In today’s world, we’re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.\nThe Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria -- client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.\nIt’s up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system. And to do that well it means that we’ve got to set priorities.\nPriority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. (Applause.) Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today’s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country. Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out./p>\nBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages -- they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. (Applause.) That is the story ISIL wants to tell. That’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don’t need to build them up to show that we’re serious, and we sure don't need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world’s largest religions. (Applause.) We just need to call them what they are -- killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed. (Applause.)\nAnd that’s exactly what we’re doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL’s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we’re taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. We’re training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. (Applause.) Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America’s commitment -- or mine -- to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden. (Applause.) Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. (Applause.) And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits. (Applause.)\nOur foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can’t stop there. For even without ISIL, even without al Qaeda, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world -- in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America, in Africa, and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage.\nWe also can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it's done with the best of intentions. (Applause.) That’s not leadership; that’s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. It’s the lesson of Vietnam; it's the lesson of Iraq -- and we should have learned it by now. (Applause.)\nFortunately, there is a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.\nThat’s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we’re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.\nThat’s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war. (Applause.)\nThat’s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. (Applause.) Our military, our doctors, our development workers -- they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million lives were saved.\nThat’s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, and protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region; we do. You want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it. It's the right thing to do. (Applause.)\nLet me give you another example. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, and set us back in Latin America. That’s why we restored diplomatic relations -- (applause) -- opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. (Applause.) So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the Cold War is over -- lift the embargo. (Applause.)\nThe point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world -- except when we kill terrorists -- or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity.\nWhen we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick -- (applause) -- it's the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now, we’re on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. That's within our grasp. (Applause.) And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria -- something I’ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year. (Applause.)\nThat's American strength. That's American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That’s why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. (Applause.) It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. (Applause.) There’s a better way. (Applause.)\nAnd that’s why we need to reject any politics -- any politics -- that targets people because of race or religion. (Applause.) Let me just say this. This is not a matter of political correctness. This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity, and our openness, and the way we respect every faith.\nHis Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot that I'm standing on tonight that “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.” When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn’t make us safer. That’s not telling it like it is. It’s just wrong. (Applause.) It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country. (Applause.)\n“We the People.” Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we’ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, and that's how we might perfect our Union. And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing that I want to say tonight.\nThe future we want -- all of us want -- opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids -- all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics.\nA better politics doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country -- different regions, different attitudes, different interests. That’s one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.\nBut democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn’t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice. It doesn’t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise, or when even basic facts are contested, or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn’t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.\nToo many Americans feel that way right now. It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency -- that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.\nBut, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task -- or any President’s -- alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber, good people who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know; you’ve told me. It's the worst-kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you aren't enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor.\nBut that means if we want a better politics -- and I'm addressing the American people now -- if we want a better politics, it’s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a President. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves. I think we've got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around. (Applause.) Let a bipartisan group do it. (Applause.)\nWe have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families or hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections. (Applause.) And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can’t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution -- because it's a problem. And most of you don't like raising money. I know; I've done it. (Applause.) We’ve got to make it easier to vote, not harder. (Applause.) We need to modernize it for the way we live now. (Applause.) This is America: We want to make it easier for people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that.\nBut I can’t do these things on my own. (Applause.) Changes in our political process -- in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected -- that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That’s what’s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.\nWhat I’m suggesting is hard. It’s a lot easier to be cynical; to accept that change is not possible, and politics is hopeless, and the problem is all the folks who are elected don't care, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.\nWe can’t afford to go down that path. It won’t deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.\nSo, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it -- our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. (Applause.) We need every American to stay active in our public life -- and not just during election time -- so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.\nIt is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not, first and foremost, as black or white, or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not as Democrat or Republican, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word -- voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.\nAnd they’re out there, those voices. They don’t get a lot of attention; they don't seek a lot of fanfare; but they’re busy doing the work this country needs doing. I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding.\nI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.\nI see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.\nI see it in the American who served his time, and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over -- and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance. The protester determined to prove that justice matters -- and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe. (Applause.)\nI see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on.\nIt’s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he’s been taught. (Applause.)\nI see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count -- because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.\nThat's the America I know. That’s the country we love. Clear-eyed. Big-hearted. Undaunted by challenge. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. (Applause.) That’s what makes me so hopeful about our future. I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people.\nAnd that’s why I stand here confident as I have ever been that the State of our Union is strong. (Applause.)\nThank you, God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\n###\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

These schools have the most crowded campuses and classrooms, have more students from low-income families, a higher number of uncredentialed teachers, and a larger number of students still learning to speak English. State funding is also needed to support the community colleges and California State Universities, which have the responsibility of training California’s 21st century workforce.\nSchool Funding Today and in Our Recent History\nDespite the funding approved in the state budget for 2019-20, California continues to lag behind the national average in per-pupil funding, has some of the largest class sizes in the country and ranks dead last in the number of counselors and librarians in our schools.\nCalifornia’s schools and students saw some relief with the passage of Proposition 30 in 2012, with much needed funding flowing to the state’s public school system. With Prop. 30 originally set to expire in 2018, Californians passed Proposition 55 - the California Education and Health Care Protection Act in 2016. Passing Prop. 55 extended taxes on the wealthiest Californians, preventing a staggering $4 billion budget deficit and severe cuts to public education.\nAs a result of Proposition 13 in 1978, more than 80 percent of school funding comes from the state. The state’s budget crisis from the not-too-distant past made us all too aware of the pitfalls of our faulty tax structure, which is currently benefiting the wealthiest corporations over Californians themselves. It’s time to restore fairness to our tax system.\nIn 1988, CTA led the fight for Proposition 98, which was approved by California voters and guarantees minimum funding to California public schools.\nCTA Policy Brief: Financing Public Education\nCTA believes that adequate state and federal funding is vital to ensuring each and every student the high-quality education they deserve. See below for CTA’s Policy Brief on Financing Public Education (August 2019)\nCTA believes that adequate state and federal funding is vital to ensuring each and every student the high-quality education they deserve. Proposition 98’s minimum funding guarantee is a floor, not a ceiling for school funding. CTA opposes any reduction in revenue to the State’s General Fund that would reduce Proposition 98 funding, including tax cuts.\nFUNDING ADEQUACY:\nSchools also need to be funded adequately so that they can provide necessary resources in classroom supply budgets to meet the individual needs of ALL students.\nAt a minimum, funding adequacy means that schools should receive allocations that — when measured on a per- pupil basis — put California in the top ten of all 50 states.\nCTA believes any additional revenues, such as any new tax increases, should go directly to the General Fund.\nPROPOSITION 98 FUNDING GUARANTEE\nThe Proposition 98 funding guarantee must be considered the minimum level – not the maximum of level – in any given state budget. CTA believes we must protect the integrity of Proposition 98.\nThe voters intended that Proposition 98 funding should be used for instructional purposes. Proposition 98 funds should not be used to underwrite the costs of school facilities. School facilities should be funded primarily from general obligation bonds.\nFUNDING RESPONSIBILITY:\nCTA believes the state and federal government should provide adequate funds for education so that school districts can meet the goal of assuring all students receive a high-quality education.\nPRIVATE SCHOOL FUNDING, TAX CUTS AND TAX “EXPENDITURES”\nCTA opposes any reduction in revenue to the State’s General Fund that would reduce Proposition 98 funding, including tax cuts and tax credits, or taxes that are designated to a special fund other than education.\nCTA opposes any attempts to use public school funding for private schooling, including vouchers, tuition tax credits, or any use of education funding for private purposes.\nSCHOOL FACILITIES\nCTA believes closed public school buildings should not be sold or leased to organizations which provide education services in direct competition with public schools.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Introduction\nGovernor Gavin Newsom released a summary of the May Revision to his proposed 2025-26 California state budget on May 14, proposing nearly $12 billion in budget actions to close an estimated 2025-26 deficit ($7.5 billion) and build up the state’s discretionary reserve ($4.5 billion). In contrast, the governor’s January proposal projected a small positive balance after two years of state deficits. The governor’s proposal reflects increased uncertainty as a result of federal policy changes and proposals that are destabilizing economic conditions, resulting in a more negative fiscal outlook for the state.\nThe $226.4 billion General Fund spending plan would protect some investments made in prior years, but notably proposes $5 billion in harmful cuts, primarily to Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program that provides health care coverage to over 14 million Californians. Those cuts include a series of proposals targeting adult Californians who are undocumented, such as freezing access to Medi-Cal, instituting $100 per month premiums for those currently enrolled, and removing access to long-term care and dental benefits, among other proposals. Other proposed cuts target older adults, people with disabilities, and foster youth — communities, like Californians who are undocumented, that are among the most vulnerable in our state.\nThe governor’s revised budget also fails to propose any major tax policy changes to increase state revenues to address the shortfall, avoid cuts, and buffer against emerging federal threats, even while federal leaders are preparing to give away more than $4 trillion in tax cuts to high-income households and corporations.\nWhile many of the details are forthcoming, the governor also proposes to partially close the budget gap through borrowing and fund transfers. The governor also proposes future cuts for programs supporting vulnerable Californians including food assistance and support for foster care in 2026-27 if revenues are not adequate.\nThe governor’s proposal continues to call for drawing down just $7.1 billion in reserves and projects total state reserves at $15.7 billion by the close of 2025-26 to guard against future revenue decline or threats to the state’s fiscal condition.\nThe governor also maintains his proposed changes to the state’s reserve policies to exempt rainy day fund deposits from the state’s spending cap, commonly known as the Gann Limit, and allow the rainy day fund to grow to 20% of General Fund revenues (up from the current 10% cap). These changes, which would need voter approval, would allow the state to set aside a larger portion of state revenues in the rainy day fund during periods of strong revenue growth.\nEven as the governor’s proposal would cut access to health care, it would commit the state to new spending to expand the film tax credit for film studios, growing the credit from $330 million to $750 million annually.\nThe governor’s spending plan protects and maintains some of the progress made in prior budget years to help improve economic security and opportunities for Californians with low incomes and Californians of color, including policy advances in behavioral health, cash assistance (refundable tax credits, CalWORKs, and SSI/SSP), and universal school meals. The proposal also maintains prior commitments to child care, but delays making additional commitments to expanding the system. The governor’s plan leaves out funding to address homelessness and abandons funding for housing programs for Californians with low incomes and affordable housing production as the state faces a growing housing crisis.\nChanges to the state’s revenue outlook result in slightly lower estimates for the Prop. 98 minimum funding guarantee for K-12 schools and community colleges compared to January. The governor’s proposal continues to fully fund the completed rollout of universal transitional kindergarten (T-K). In a notable shift from January, the May Revision reduces proposed cuts to CSU and UC from 8% to 3%.\nThe administration projects that the state prison population will moderately increase in the near term due to the passage of Prop. 36 in November 2024, which increased penalties for certain drug and theft offenses, including by reversing some of Prop. 47’s (2014) sentencing reforms. However, the administration projects that the prison population will resume its long-term decline due to other justice system reforms that remain in effect. As a result, the governor proposes to close one additional state prison by late 2026.\nOverall, while the governor’s proposed spending plan protects some of the progress made in earlier years, cutting access to health care and other supports for adult Californians who are undocumented, seniors, and people with disabilities, failing to advance more equitable tax policies, and misguided expansion of tax credits for film studios would weaken the state’s capacity to better help Californians manage our state’s high cost of living and meet basic needs.\nWith federal leaders poised to extend and expand tax cuts that primarily benefit big corporations and high-income households, offset in part by unprecedented cuts to health care, food assistance, and other vital public supports, state leaders have a responsibility to make our state’s tax system more equitable, protect the economic security and well-being of all Californians, and present a starkly different vision than federal leaders.\nThis First Look report outlines key pieces of the May Revision and outlines the governor’s priorities in balancing the budget to address a projected shortfall.\nContents\nBudget Overview\n- Economic Outlook: Economic Outlook Deteriorates, Reflecting Federal Policies and Uncertainty\n- Revenue: Revised Revenue Estimates Downgraded by $5.2 Billion for Three-Year Budget Window\n- Tax Policy: Governor Maintains January Tax Policy Proposals and Proposes No New Revenue\n- Reserves: Governor’s May Revision Maintains Proposal to Withdraw Reserve Funds and Change Reserves Policies\nHealth\n- Coverage, Affordability, & Access: May Revision Harms Californians’ Health and Access to Care\n- Proposition 35: Revised Spending Plan Adjusts MCO Tax Spending\n- Behavioral Health: Governor’s Revised Budget Sustains Behavioral Health Initiatives\nHousing & Homelessness\n- Housing: May Revision Continues to Withhold New Funding for Housing Affordability\n- Homelessness: May Revision Abandons Funding to End Homelessness in California\nEconomic Security\n- Refundable Tax Credits: Revised Budget Proposes No Changes to Refundable Tax Credits\n- Family & Child Well-Being: Revised Budget Includes Wins for CalWORKs but Cuts to Multiple Foster Youth Programs\n- Food Assistance: Governor Invests in Fighting Child Hunger, Leaves Out Older Adults\n- Californians with Disabilities and Older Adults: Revised Budget Fails to Invest in Older Adults and Californians with Disabilities\n- Child Care: Governor’s Revised Budget Fails to Make Clear Progress Toward Rate Reform\n- Immigrant Californians: Governor Cuts Support for Immigrant Californians\n- Domestic Violence: Governor Does Not Provide Needed Support to Domestic and Sexual Violence Survivors\nEducation\n- Early Learning & Pre-K: Transitional Kindergarten Continues Planned Expansion\n- Proposition 98: Revised Budget Adjusts the Prop. 98 Guarantee Downward\n- TK-12 Education: Revised Spending Plan Largely Maintains TK-12 Programs\n- Community Colleges: Revised Budget Scales Back Previously Proposed Initiatives at the Community Colleges\n- CSU/UC: Revised Budget Maintains Deferrals for the CSU and UC, Reduces Previously Proposed Cuts\n- Student Financial Aid: Revised State Budget Adjusts Student Aid as Federal Threats Emerge\nJustice System\n- State Corrections: May Revision Calls for Closing an Additional State Prison by October 2026\n- Proposition 36 Impact: Revised Budget Includes Little Funding to Implement Proposition 36\n- Proposition 47 Investments: May Revision Projects Steep Drop in Proposition 47 Savings in Coming Years\nClimate Change\n- Wildfire Relief and Recovery: Budget Maintains Funding for Wildfire Relief and Recovery\nBudget Overview\nEconomic Outlook Deteriorates, Reflecting Federal Policies and Uncertainty\nThe administration’s economic outlook projects trends in major economic indicators that affect state tax collections and revenues in the budget. The administration downgrades the state’s economic outlook in the revised budget based on recent federal policies, most notably, the imposition of significant tariffs, including on California’s major trading partners. The administration estimates that California’s average tariff rate has increased from 2.4% last year to 27% as of mid-April and notes that this will have “immediate and broad-reaching impacts affecting nearly all the state’s $500 billion worth of imported goods as of 2024, nearly 12% of its economic output.” As a result, the revised budget:\n- Significantly downgrades its projections of US economic growth, particularly in 2025 when real Gross Domestic Product is expected to increase by just 1.3% — well below the pre-pandemic average growth rate of 2.6%.\n- Significantly revises up its projection of inflation in the US and California, as the cost of tariffs is largely expected to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. The administration expects the California Consumer Price Index to increase by 3.8% in 2025, followed by another 3.5% increase in 2026.\n- Revises down its projection for job growth, now expecting the state to add just 6,000 jobs per month in 2025 and 3,000 per month in 2026 — substantially below the pre-pandemic average of around 30,000 jobs added per month.\n- Expects the state’s unemployment rate to increase by 0.1 percentage point to 5.4% in 2025 and then to 5.5% in 2026 and 2027.\n- Downgrades its forecast for inflation-adjusted wage and personal income growth in the state.\nThe revised budget notes that this forecast is based on policies in place as of mid-April and that federal policy uncertainty remains the biggest downside risk to the forecast. In other words, if federal policy choices over the coming weeks and months further weaken the economy, the state’s economic outlook will further deteriorate.\nWeakened Outlook and Federal Policies Threaten Californians’ Well-Being\nWhile the administration’s outlook is useful for understanding how economic conditions might impact budget revenues, it’s also important to consider how economic conditions are affecting Californians, who count on programs and services funded by federal and state budgets. Although California is now the fourth largest economy in the world, millions of Californians aren’t sharing in our state’s prosperity. More than 7 million state residents lack the resources to meet basic needs, over half of renters have unaffordable housing costs, and more than 1 in 5 households experience food hardship. Black, Latinx, and other Californians of color disproportionately face these challenges due to centuries of structural racism and long-standing inequities in opportunity that have been structured into budget policies, past and present.\nCompounding these challenges, policies being pursued by the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress will further drive up costs, making it even harder for families and individuals to make ends meet. For example, the Trump Administration’s sweeping tariff policy will add to the economic challenges facing people with lower incomes because tariffs are essentially regressive taxes. Plus, economists have warned that the drastic and chaotic nature of these tariffs could plunge the economy into a recession, exacerbating the economic challenges facing families, workers, and businesses. On top of this, the budget package currently advancing through Congress would slash federal funding for health care, food assistance, and other vital services, jeopardizing the health and well-being of millions of Californians. This includes:\n- Massive cuts to funding for Medi-Cal and efforts to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act that would cause Californians to lose health coverage, have fewer benefits, face higher health care costs, and experience more difficulty getting care;\n- The largest cut to SNAP food assistance (CalFresh in California) in history that would put low-income families and individuals at greater risk of hunger by taking away some or all of their food benefits; and\n- Terminating many immigrants’ access to vital programs, including denying Medicare to lawful permanent residents who have worked and paid taxes to support the program, denying SNAP to refugees, asylees, and other humanitarian immigrants, and denying the Child Tax Credit to US citizen children in mixed status families.\nRevised Revenue Estimates Downgraded by $5.2 Billion for Three-Year Budget Window\nWhile actual revenue collections for the current (2024-25) and previous (2023-24) fiscal years have been stronger than expected since the January budget proposal, the administration now projects revenues for the upcoming 2025-26 budget year to be $10.5 billion lower relative to the January projections, primarily due to economic and stock market uncertainty stemming from federal actions including President Trump’s tariff policies. This includes downgrades in the projected revenues across all three of the state’s “Big Three” revenue sources — personal income taxes, corporate taxes, and sales taxes.\nAcross the three-year budget window, state General Fund revenues are now projected to be $5.2 billion lower than the January budget projection, as the improved collections for 2023-24 and 2024-25 offset some of the downgrade in the 2025-26 forecast. This estimate is of a similar magnitude as recent revenue projections from the Legislative Analyst’s Office. Because this estimate only takes into account state-level General Fund revenues, it does not factor in any potential impacts of proposed reductions in funding from the federal government currently being considered in Congress.\nThe continuing uncertainty in the economic outlook — related to inconsistent tariff policies, deep cuts to the federal workforce, and threats of mass deportations — poses additional risks to the revenue forecast. While the May Revision does not assume an economic recession during the budget window, the administration estimates that if a mild recession were to occur, the “Big Three” revenue sources could end up being around $14 billion lower across the three-year budget window than the primary estimate.\nGovernor Maintains January Tax Policy Proposals and Proposes No New Revenue\nThe Governor’s proposal comes at a time when millions of Californians could be harmed by proposed deep federal cuts to health care, food assistance, and other critical basic needs in order to pay for tax cuts that primarily benefit high-income households and corporations. State leaders have the responsibility to maintain core state services and protect vulnerable Californians who will be most impacted by federal cuts. Policymakers can achieve this by significantly increasing state revenues and ending or reforming inequitable tax breaks that benefit profitable corporations and wealthy people.\nHowever, the governor’s revised budget contains no new revenue proposals. He maintains the tax policy proposals included in the January budget proposal, including expanding the tax break for the film industry by more than doubling the annual film credit allocation from $330 million to $750 million — even while proposing to make cuts to health care and other services for Californians with low incomes (see sections on Health Coverage, Affordability, and Access and Californians with Disabilities and Older Adults).\nThe administration continues to estimate that the governor’s tax proposals as a whole will increase state General Fund revenues by $186 million in 2025-26. This revenue increase is related to a proposed change to the way banks and other financial institutions are taxed. However, this modest increase may be offset in upcoming years by revenue decreases due to the film credit expansion.\nAs the details of the harmful federal funding and service cuts become more clear, Californians will be looking to state leaders to protect community members who will be deeply impacted by those policies. Closely scrutinizing state tax breaks and equitably raising state revenue should be part of the solution to mitigate the suffering caused by destructive federal actions without reversing commitments already made to promote health and well-being for Californians.\nGovernor’s May Revision Maintains Proposal to Withdraw Reserve Funds and Change Reserves Policies\nCalifornia has a number of state reserve accounts that set aside funds intended to be used for a “rainy day” when economic conditions worsen and state revenues decline. Some reserves are established in the state’s Constitution to require deposits and restrict withdrawals, and some are at the discretion of state policymakers.\nCalifornia voters approved Proposition 2 in November 2014, amending the California Constitution to revise the rules for the state’s Budget Stabilization Account (BSA), commonly referred to as the rainy day fund. Prop. 2 requires an annual set-aside equal to 1.5% of estimated General Fund revenues. An additional set-aside is required when capital gains revenues in a given year exceed 8% of General Fund tax revenues. For 15 years — from 2015-16 to 2029-30 — half of these funds must be deposited into the rainy day fund, and the other half is to be used to reduce certain state liabilities (also known as “budgetary debt”).\nProp. 2 also established a new state budget reserve for K-12 schools and community colleges called the Public School System Stabilization Account (PSSSA). The PSSSA requires that when certain conditions are met, the state must deposit a portion of General Fund revenues into this reserve as part of California’s Prop. 98 funding guarantee (see section on Prop. 98).\nIn order to access the funds in the BSA and PSSSA, the governor must declare a budget emergency — an action that was taken in the enacted current-year (2024-25) budget in response to the state’s projected budget deficit.\nThe BSA and the PSSSA are not California’s only reserve funds. The 2018-19 budget agreement created the Safety Net Reserve Fund, which is intended to hold funds to be used to maintain benefits and services for CalWORKs and Medi-Cal participants in the event of an economic downturn. Additionally, the state has a Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties (SFEU) — a reserve fund that accounts for unallocated General Fund dollars and that gives state leaders total discretion as to when and how they can use the available funds.\nThe governor’s May Revision projects $15.7 billion in reserves at the end of 2025-26. Specifically, the proposal:\n- Includes a $7.1 billion withdrawal from the BSA and, due to other required adjustments, leaves the remaining BSA balance at $11.2 billion. (This withdrawal was assumed as part of the 2024-25 state budget package.)\n- Projects the PSSSA will have a zero balance, down from an estimated $1.5 billion in the governor’s January proposal due to a reduction in required deposits and a mandatory withdrawal.\n- Leaves the Safety Net Reserve with a zero balance. (The 2024-25 state budget drained all funds from this reserve.)\n- Projects an SFEU balance of $4.5 billion.\nAdministration maintains January plan to change reserve policies\nThe administration also maintains its January proposal to revise the state’s reserve policies under Prop. 2 (2014) and Prop. 4 (1979), which created an arbitrary spending cap known as the Gann Limit. The administration contends that these changes are needed in order to ensure the state can adequately build up reserves during periods of strong revenue growth to offset years of revenue decline.\nUnder Prop. 2, deposits into any reserve, including the BSA, are counted as expenditures under the spending cap. This means that savings for future budget needs are treated as spending in the year the deposit is made. As a result, in years when revenues are strong, the required deposit into the BSA could put the state at risk of exceeding the spending cap since the deposit is counted as part of the state’s overall expenditures. In order to address this situation, the governor proposes to exempt annual BSA deposits from the spending cap so that they no longer count as spending.\nProposition 2 also set a maximum size of the BSA at 10% of state General Fund revenue. The governor proposes to increase the maximum BSA deposit from 10% to 20% of General Fund revenues to allow state leaders to grow reserves to higher levels during periods when revenues are strong.\nHealth\nMay Revision Harms Californians’ Health and Access to Care\nAccess to health care is necessary for everyone to be healthy and thrive. Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program, provides free or low-cost health care to over one-third of the state’s population. This program covers a wide range of services to Californians with modest incomes, and many children, seniors, people with disabilities, and pregnant individuals rely on it.\nCuts to Medi-Cal\nThe governor’s revised spending plan proposes sweeping cuts to Medi-Cal that reverse years of progress toward a more inclusive, equitable health system. These cuts particularly harm undocumented Californians, but also impact low-income individuals across the state, reducing access to essential services, prescription drugs, and health care providers. This marks a major shift away from the state’s commitment to expanding health care access, especially for immigrant communities, seniors, and people with disabilities.\nThe revised budget includes harmful cuts specifically targeting undocumented Californians, mostly adults ages 19 and older. Some of these cuts may also affect all individuals who are federally ineligible for Medicaid, such as lawful permanent residents during a federal five-year waiting period. Despite the serious consequences of these proposals, the administration failed to clearly define who is included in these categories. When people’s health care is on the line, vague language and ambiguity are not just irresponsible. They are harmful.\nThe May Revision proposes the following cuts that would primarily impact undocumented Californians ages 19 and older:\n- Freeze Medi-Cal enrollment beginning January 2026.\n- Impose a $100 monthly Medi-Cal premium.\n- Eliminate long-term care benefits.\n- Eliminate dental benefits.\n- Eliminate In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) for undocumented adults beginning January 2026.\n- Reduce funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and rural health clinics.\n- Implement a pharmacy rebate aggregator.\nThe governor’s revised budget also includes broader cuts that would affect all Medi-Cal enrollees, including seniors, people with disabilities, and individuals managing chronic health conditions. Specifically, the May Revision proposes to:\n- Reinstate Medi-Cal asset limits.\n- Make multiple cuts to In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS).\n- Eliminate acupuncture as a Medi-Cal benefit\nThe revised budget also includes provider payment reductions and cuts to health care infrastructure that could destabilize the health care system, which already faced a provider shortage. Specifically, the May Revision proposes to:\n- Eliminate Proposition 56 supplemental payments.\n- Suspend the Proposition 56 loan repayment program.\n- Cut support for skilled nursing facilities.\n- Impose prior authorization for hospice care.\n- Cap payments to PACE providers (Program of All-Inclusive Care of the Elderly)\nThe revised budget also proposes a series of changes to Medi-Cal’s pharmacy benefits that would affect millions of enrollees. These proposals would undermine access to timely, effective, and affordable treatment. Specifically, the May Revision proposes to:\n- End coverage for GLP-1 drugs (e.g., Ozempic and Wegovy).\n- Imposes step therapy protocols.\n- Imposes prior authorization for continuation of drug therapy.\n- Imposes prescription drug utilization management.\n- Eliminate over-the-counter drug coverage.\nFederal Threats to Health Care Access\nThe harmful cuts proposed in the May Revision come at a time when California’s health care system faces serious threats from the federal level. Congressional Republicans are advancing a federal budget proposal that prioritizes tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy while slashing investments in health care. This includes deep cuts to Medicaid and efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act (ACA), both of which could severely jeopardize access to care for millions of Californians.\nMedi-Cal, which provides health coverage to nearly 15 million people and accounts for almost two-thirds (64.4%) of all federal funding flowing through California’s state budget, is particularly at risk. Reduced federal funding would lead to a significant budget shortfall, leaving state leaders with critical decisions about how to protect Medi-Cal and the Californians who depend on it.\nIn the face of these threats, California leaders should pursue policy solutions that protect and strengthen health care access. This includes reforming the state’s tax system to ensure profitable corporations pay their fair share and eliminating tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Californians. These steps would raise the revenue to help support vital health care programs (see tax policy section) and allow California to protect its progress — and its people — from harmful federal actions.\nFederal Policy\nThe federal government plays a major role in shaping California’s budget, economy, and the well-being of its people.\nRevised Spending Plan Adjusts MCO Tax Spending\nProposition 35, which voters approved in November 2024, significantly changed how state policymakers can use revenue from the Managed Care Organization (MCO) tax. State leaders have historically relied on much of this revenue to reduce or offset General Fund spending on Medi-Cal. While Prop. 35 allows policymakers to continue using a portion of this funding for that purpose, the amount has been reduced and will decrease further starting in 2027.\nThe revised budget reflects the following MCO tax revenue to offset General Fund spending to support existing Medi-Cal services:\n- $9 billion in 2024-25\n- $4.2 billion in 2025-26\n- $2.8 billion in 2026-27\nCompared to the Governor’s January proposal, this is an increase of $1.1 billion in 2024-25 and decreases of $200 million in 2025-26 and $400 million in 2026-27.\nThe May Revision reflects $804 million in 2024-25, $2.8 billion in 2025-26, and $2.4 billion in 2026-27 for the MCO Tax and Proposition 35 expenditure plan. This includes $1.6 billion across 2025-26 and 2026-27 to support increases in managed care base rates relative to calendar year 2024 for primary care, specialty care, ground emergency medical transportation, and hospital outpatient procedures.\nFederal Threats to MCO Tax Revenue\nThe long-term stability of the MCO tax remains uncertain. Its structure must be periodically approved by the federal government to comply with Medicaid financing rules, and proposed federal changes could severely limit how states use provider taxes to draw down federal funds.\nCongressional Republicans are advancing a federal budget proposal that includes deep health care cuts and new limits on provider taxes. These changes could cost California billions in federal funding each year. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently issued a proposed rule that would restrict how states structure provider taxes by targeting a financing mechanism currently used to generate federal Medicaid funds. If finalized, this rule would significantly limit California’s ability to rely on the MCO tax to support Medi-Cal.\nThese federal policy changes could significantly disrupt California’s ability to generate and allocate MCO tax revenue. These growing risks underscore the need for state leaders to identify more stable, long-term funding sources to protect Medi-Cal and maintain critical health care investments.\nGovernor’s Revised Budget Sustains Behavioral Health Initiatives\nMillions of Californians rely on county services for mental health and substance use treatment, known as behavioral health care. Many of these individuals face housing insecurity, justice system involvement, or child welfare placement. Strengthening the state’s behavioral health system is essential to guaranteeing that every Californian can access the care they need regardless of race, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, or where they live. In recent years, state policymakers have launched various initiatives to transform California’s behavioral health system with the goal of improving access.\nContinuing BH-Connect\nThe governor’s May Revise maintains funding for the launch of California’s Behavioral Health Community-Based Organized Networks of Equitable Care and Treatment (BH-CONNECT), which was announced in his January budget proposal. This multiyear initiative aims to improve access to behavioral health services for Medi-Cal members with significant needs, focusing on children and youth involved in child welfare, people involved in the justice system, and individuals at risk of or experiencing homelessness.\nFunding for BH-CONNECT includes $8 billion in state and federal resources over four years. Major components of BH-CONNECT include workforce investments, transitional rent assistance, and support for children and youth in child welfare, among others.\nSustaining Proposition 1 Implementation\nProposition 1, which voters approved in March 2024, is a two-part measure that amended California’s Mental Health Services Act and created a $6.38 billion general obligation bond to fund behavioral health treatment, residential facilities, and supportive housing for veterans and Californians with behavioral health needs.\nIn 2024, state leaders allocated funding to begin Prop. 1 implementation, including $85 million ($50 million General Fund) for 2024-25 for county behavioral health departments, which provide mental health and substance use disorder services to Californians through Medi-Cal and other programs. The administration maintains their January proposal of an additional $93.5 million total funds ($55 million General Fund) for 2025-26 for Prop. 1 implementation at the county level.\nOther Behavioral Health Initiatives Sustained\nThe governor’s revised budget also continues other behavioral health initiatives that were launched in previous budget agreements, including:\n- California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM)\n- The Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative\n- Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Court\nNew Behavioral Health Investments\nThe revised budget also introduces two smaller actions:\n- CalHOPE Warm Line: $5 million from the Behavioral Health Services Fund (BHSF) to support the continuation of the CalHOPE Warm Line — a 24/7 phone line program that offers free, confidential support to Californians — through 2025-26 and beyond.\n- Trainings for ACEs Providers: $2.9 million in total funds (with $1.46 million from the BHSF and $1.46 million from federal funds) to support trainings for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) providers.\nFederal Threats to Behavioral Health\nCongressional Republicans are actively pursuing budget cuts that would severely threaten California’s behavioral health services. Medicaid is the largest payer of behavioral health services in the country and makes up a significant portion of counties’ mental health budgets, so cuts to this program at the federal level undermine the ability of state and local governments to provide behavioral health support. Additionally, programs like CalAIM and BH-CONNECT rely on federal waivers to use Medicaid funding for purposes such as housing navigation, and the federal government could choose to let the waivers expire or rescind them. Any funding cuts at the federal level would devastate the ability of hospitals, community centers, and other behavioral health providers in supporting Californians who desperately need help.\nHousing & Homelessness\nMay Revision Continues to Withhold New Funding for Housing Affordability\nCalifornia is home to over 6 million renter households, more than half of whom face unaffordable housing costs. This burden falls hardest on low-income families with children, older adults on fixed incomes, and working Californians whose wages don’t keep pace with the cost of living. For these Californians, already stretched thin, the high cost of housing makes other basic needs — like food, child care, gas, and medical care — unreachable. Yet these same Californians are once again being left behind in the name of austerity.\nThe May Revision upholds the administration’s decision to withhold any new or ongoing state investments in affordable housing. Worse, it proposes deeper state funding cuts to already gutted affordable housing programs, including reverting $31.7 million of unexpended General Fund for the Infill Infrastructure Grant Catalytic Program, the Commercial Property Pilot Program, and the 2021 Infill Infrastructure Grant Program that was appropriated in previous years. The revised budget also calls to restructure the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), putting at risk the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program (AHSC) which it currently supports. This program has funded over 20,000 affordable homes near transit, advancing both housing and climate goals.\nThe Governor did state his support for two housing development-related bills that would create building exemptions to the California Environmental Quality Act which may encourage housing production in certain instances. He also stated his support for a housing and infrastructure bond. However, even if California voters pass the bond in the upcoming election, funding wouldn’t be available until 2027 — while most affordable housing programs will run out of funds by the end of this year.\nEfforts to increase housing production through streamlining and coordination are important, but not enough. Policymakers must pair them with ongoing investments in deeply affordable housing and strong tenant protections — such as anti-price gouging laws and rental assistance—to prevent more people from losing their homes.\nThis is especially urgent now, as federal housing programs could face deep cuts under the Trump Administration. In California, federal housing programs support over 920,000 people but fall far short of meeting demand, and nearly 15,000 California emergency housing choice vouchers will be lost soon without additional funding. While the May Revision does include an increase of $416.6 million one-time Federal Trust Fund to support recovery from natural disasters in 2023 and 2024, these dollars do not holistically address the state’s ongoing affordable housing crisis (see Climate Change section). As the state pulls back its own investments, this will only cause more Californians to face housing instability and homelessness without intentional, sustained action.\nMay Revision Abandons Funding to End Homelessness in California\nCalifornia has both the resources and the responsibility to ensure every resident has a stable, dignified place to call home. Last year alone, homeless service providers served over 350,000 Californians experiencing homelessness — demonstrating both the scale of need and the increased capacity of the state’s response systems. This expanded reach was made possible in part by previous one-time state investments that funded critical homelessness prevention and resolution services. However, most of these funds were temporary and are now approaching critical funding cliffs.\nYet despite record numbers of people being served and housed, the Governor’s revised 2025–26 budget includes no new or ongoing state funds to address homelessness, putting hard-won progress at risk and abandoning the state’s most vulnerable residents and the permanent solutions that will solve homelessness.\nInstead, the May Revision proposes $4.2 million ($4 million General Fund) in 2025-26, $6.4 million ($6.2 million General Fund) in 2026-27, and $6.2 million ($6.1 million General Fund) in 2027-28 and ongoing to support the reorganization of the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency, which is set to be dissolved by July 2026. This restructuring will establish a new California Housing and Homelessness Agency aimed at improving alignment across housing and homelessness programs.\nThe Administration also proposes $200 million in Proposition 35 funds over two years to establish Flexible Housing Pools to support Behavioral Health Services Act reforms and Medi-Cal transitional rent benefits (see Proposition 35 Implementation and Behavioral Health sections). While these funds could help unhoused individuals with serious behavioral health conditions secure housing, they fall far short in addressing the broader statewide housing and homelessness needs. Plus, the additional proposed deep cuts to Medi-Cal and eligibility limitations could harm the same Californians these investments are attempting to serve (see Coverage, Affordability & Access section).\nMeanwhile, local governments and service providers are bracing for the possibility of severe federal cuts proposed by the Trump Administration, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance, the elimination of key homelessness grants, and the possible loss of more than 15,000 California emergency housing choice vouchers — threatening to push thousands back into homelessness. Without bold, ongoing state investment, policymakers risk reversing progress and deepening a crisis that demands urgent and sustained action to continue supporting the real solutions needed.\nEconomic Security\nRevised Budget Proposes No Changes to Refundable Tax Credits\nCalifornia’s three refundable income tax credits — the California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC), Young Child Tax Credit, and Foster Youth Tax Credit — provide financial support to low-income Californians, including undocumented workers who file taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), helping them pay for essentials like housing and food. These state credits are especially vital because they benefit many Californians who are excluded or receive minimal support from the federal EITC and Child Tax Credit (CTC).\nCalifornia’s credits may become an even more important source of support for families and individuals if legislation that Congressional Republicans are currently advancing is enacted. This legislation would create onerous new processes that will make it harder for families to claim the federal EITC, likely causing eligible families to lose access to the credit. It also would strip the federal CTC from millions of US citizen and legal resident children living in mixed-status families, including an estimated 910,000 children in California. And while this legislation would increase the CTC for children in families with high incomes, it would provide nothing to children in families with low incomes, including about 2 million children in California. In addition to these threats, a recent unprecedented federal threat to taxpayer privacy protections risks making taxpayers afraid to file their taxes, causing them to lose access to vital state and federal tax credit support.\nThe Governor’s revised budget proposes no changes to California’s refundable state tax credits and maintains the Administration’s January proposal to provide just $10 million for tax credit outreach, education, and free tax preparation grants. These grants help community based organizations provide on-the-ground and online linguistically and culturally competent services to tax filers. This proposed level of funding is down by half from $20 million provided in 2023-24 and $12 million in 2024-25.\nRevised Budget Includes Wins for CalWORKs but Cuts to Multiple Foster Youth Programs\nMillions of families across the state struggle to afford basic necessities. The California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) and foster youth programs help parents feel supported and ensure children are given the opportunity to succeed. Amidst this budget shortfall, this administration’s revised spending plan includes some wins for CalWORKs, while simultaneously proposing millions of dollars in cuts to programs that support foster youth in California.\nThe CalWORKs program is a critical component of California’s safety net for families with low incomes that helps over 650,000 children and their families with modest cash grants, employment assistance, and critical supportive services. The proposed budget would strengthen CalWORKs by:\n- Granting more flexibility in allowable welfare-to-work activities. The proposal would add goal-oriented activities to help better support the needs of individual parents and would also make Job Club, which provides support for resume writing, interviewing, and other job search activities, optional to align with the needs and various trajectories of individuals.\n- Reducing the administrative burden on counties by replacing county welfare-to-work reporting requirements with administrative data extracts.\n- Simplifying the process for families to regain assistance after being sanctioned. Currently, families that are sanctioned can face significant and ongoing penalties that affect their ability to meet their basic needs. Reducing the red tape around sanctions can help more families regain access to their full CalWORKs grant.\nHowever, the May Revision proposes cuts to several programs that support foster youth. The revised budget:\n- Cuts $50 million one-time funding in 2025-26 for the Hope, Opportunity, Perseverance, and Empowerment (HOPE) for Children Trust Account Program.\n- Reduces funding for The Emergency Child Care Bridge Program for Foster Children (Bridge Program).\n- Cuts $13.1 million in funding for the Family Urgency Response System (FURS) in 2025-26.\n- Fails to immediately implement the Tiered Rate Structure for foster youth.\nGovernor Invests in Fighting Child Hunger, Leaves Out Older Adults\nCalifornia has led the nation in fighting child hunger as the first state to adopt universal school meals in 2022. The governor’s revision builds on this by investing an additional:\n- $90.7 million ongoing Proposition 98 to fully fund the universal school meals program and guarantee each child can access breakfast and lunch at school regardless of their family’s income.\n- $21.9 million ongoing Proposition 98 and $57.5 million General Fund to expand state-match dollars and outreach for the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (SUN Bucks) program. This program provides families with low incomes $120 for food for each school-aged child over the summer while they cannot access school meals.\nHowever, the governor does not propose any additional funding for other core food assistance programs. Instead, the May Revision:\n- Walks back commitment to expanding the California Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to undocumented older adults age 55 and over. The revised budget adds language that would make the expansion contingent on available funding in 2027. Furthermore, the administration also has not put forth any plans to end this exclusion for undocumented Californians under age 55, even while 64% of undocumented Californians are living in or near poverty.\n- Fails to invest in CalFood, allowing the funding expansion to expire, which will take the average annual funding California food banks receive down to $8 million from $60 million. The additional funding to food banks has been key in helping them meet more diverse needs and serve more people in need with California-grown food.\nFood assistance benefits are already too low and facing significant threats at the federal level. SNAP — known as CalFresh in California — is set to face up to $300 billion in federal cuts with the possible implementation of harmful proposals like shifting costs onto California and expanding time limits for participants. These cuts could impose billions of dollars worth of costs onto the state not accounted for in the May Revision and reduce benefits for the over 5 million Californians who rely on CalFresh.\nRevised Budget Fails to Invest in Older Adults and Californians with Disabilities\nAll Californians deserve to feel included, supported, and treated with dignity in their communities regardless of their age, ability, race, gender, or economic status. However, Californians with disabilities and older adults face significant barriers, with increasing risks of not meeting their basic needs. The May Revision fails to invest in these communities.\nInstead, the revised budget:\n- Proposes over $1 billion in mostly ongoing cuts to the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Program.\n- Proposes over $120 million in 2025-26 and over $300 million in 2026-27 in cuts to the Department of Developmental Services (DDS).\n- Does not reinstate the cost of living adjustment (COLA) for the State Supplementary Payment (SSP) program.\nThese cuts and lack of investments coupled with the uncertainty around the California Food Assistance Program (CFAP) expansion to older adults regardless of immigration status (see Food Assistance section) and the devastating cuts to the Medi-Cal program would compound the harm people with disabilities and older adults in California are already experiencing.\nGovernor’s Revised Budget Fails to Make Clear Progress Toward Rate Reform\nCalifornia’s child care and development programs administered by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) are integral for supporting California’s families and child care providers. Despite recent progress (such as increased overall funding, reduced family fees, and new child care provider health and retirement benefits), the child care system is still falling short for both families and child care providers. The number of subsidized child care spaces does not meet demand, meaning that thousands of families face prohibitively high child care costs. Specifically, without access to a child care subsidy, a single mother of an infant and a school-age child in California will spend, on average, 61% of her income on child care. Moreover, California child care provider wages have not kept up with the living wage, pointing to the urgent need for child care provider rate reform. Overall, the May Revision maintains previous commitments but fails to make advancements on provider pay that are needed for an equitable and stable child care system.\nThe governor’s revised budget:\n- Includes $7 billion to support current child care and development program commitments.\n- Maintains plan to add approximately 200,000 new child care slots.\n- Does not include a new rate structure to pay providers the true cost of care.\n- Maintains 2024-25 child care provider temporary rate increases.\nIn light of federal threats, California faces many uncertainties that impact available funding for rate reform. Yet, child care providers face constant worry about their economic stability. Additionally, CCPU shared that in their recent contract negotiations, the state proposed to eliminate their health benefits and cut their retirement plan. Proposed federal cuts to Medi-Cal and CalFresh only exacerbate this proposed cut from the state, underscoring the need to maintain provider benefits and implement a rate structure that pays providers the true cost of care.\nGovernor Cuts Support for Immigrant Californians\nImmigrants and their families are deeply ingrained in the state’s social fabric. They are members of the state’s workforce, pay taxes, attend schools, own businesses, and raise families who invest in local communities. California has the largest share of immigrant residents of any state. Over half of all California workers are immigrants or children of immigrants, and more than 2 million Californians are undocumented, according to estimates. Undocumented immigrants in California make significant contributions to state and federal revenues, contributing $8.5 billion in state and local taxes in 2022, despite their exclusion from most public benefits.\nState leaders have made notable progress in recent years working towards a California for all where all people have access to economic opportunity and essential services, regardless of immigration status. In a special session called for by the governor earlier this year, legislators and the governor approved $25 million in funding for legal resources for potential fights with the incoming federal administration plus an additional $25 million to defend immigrants against deportation, detention, and wage theft.\nHowever, the governor’s revised budget marks a significant reversal in working towards a California for all. At a time when the federal government is actively working to dismantle rights and protections for immigrants, it is critical now more than ever that California ensures the safety and well-being of all people, especially undocumented immigrants. Federal deportation policies and restrictions on immigration are not only tearing apart California families, but also threatening the state’s economic vitality, workforce stability, and access to essential services like food, housing, and care.\nInstead of providing support to immigrants, the governor’s revised budget does not include any additional funding to protect and support the state’s immigrant communities and instead cuts funding for key programs serving immigrants. Specifically, the 2025-26 revised budget:\n- Halts access to health programs for undocumented immigrants.\n- Pauses expansion to a nutrition assistance program.\n- Does not include additional funding to bolster legal services programs.\n- Does not include funding to bolster the safety net for California workers who lose their jobs and are undocumented.\nGiven the actions the federal government has already taken against immigrant communities in California, state leaders should be taking bold action and making investments — not cuts — that ensure all Californians, regardless of immigration status, feel safe and have the resources they need to thrive.\nGovernor Does Not Provide Needed Support to Domestic and Sexual Violence Survivors\nEvery Californian deserves to live in a world where they feel safe. However, millions of Californians experience domestic and sexual violence every year — women, transgender, non-binary Californians, and some women of color are most likely to experience this type of violence.\nThe state receives federal funding through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to help provide essential services to survivors of crime, including survivors of domestic and sexual violence. These funds help provide survivors with critical services like emergency shelter, counseling, and financial assistance.\nHowever, anticipated cuts to VOCA at the federal level would result in a roughly 45% cut to state grants for organizations that support survivors of crime, decimating the funding of many of these organizations who rely entirely on VOCA funding to provide these critical services. Additionally, the US Justice Department has already cut $811 million in grants, which includes cutting funding to programs providing services to domestic violence survivors.\nThe governor’s May Revision:\n- Does not provide funding to fill the gap in crime victim services funding.\n- Eliminates all funding for the cash assistance program for survivors.\nWant to Better Understand\nthe State Budget?\nThe Budget Center’s essential resources for understanding and navigating the California state budget — all in one place.\nExplore tools, videos, and expert insights designed to strengthen your advocacy and guide informed decision-making.\nEducation\nTransitional Kindergarten Continues Planned Expansion\nThe California Department of Education (CDE) hosts two early learning and care programs: Transitional Kindergarten (TK) and the California State Preschool Program (CSPP). CSPP provides preschool to children ages 3 and 4 for families with low to moderate incomes and temporarily to 2-year-olds until 2027 in both school and community-based settings. TK serves 4-year-olds, and eligibility is based on age alone in public schools and is not dependent on family income. Together, CSPP and TK are cornerstones of CDE’s Universal Preschool plan intended to bring more early learning and care options to 3-and 4-year-olds in California. Moreover, TK and school-based CSPP are funded through the state’s Proposition 98 guarantee (see Proposition 98 section). However, as California strives to create a mixed delivery system that centers the needs of families, the administration has the opportunity to spend resources and implement policies in a way that integrates CSPP and TK with the broader early learning system to best support families with young children.\nThe governor’s revised budget:\n- Funds the completed rollout of Universal TK.\n- Implements new TK ratio guidelines.\n- Funds English language proficiency screeners and supplementary funding for multilingual learners in TK.\n- Maintains CSPP program levels but suspends cost of living adjustment (COLA).\nRevised Budget Adjusts the Prop. 98 Guarantee Downward\nApproved by voters in 1988, Proposition 98 constitutionally guarantees a minimum level of annual funding for K-12 schools, community colleges, and the state preschool program. The Prop. 98 guarantee tends to reflect changes in state General Fund revenues, and revenue estimates consequently update the minimum guarantee funding levels. The 2025-26 revised spending plan reflects downward adjustments in the minimum guarantee estimates and, given changes in revenue, it adjusts required deposits and withdrawals from the Prop. 98 reserve — the state budget reserve for K-12 schools and community colleges. The revised budget also makes changes to the Prop. 98 split between TK-12 and community colleges.\nThe chart below shows updated projections of the guarantee in the May Revision compared to projections in the January budget proposal and the 2024-25 enacted budget.\nProp. 98 revised estimates and proposed adjustments include the following:\n- The January proposal projected the 2025-26 Prop. 98 guarantee to be $118.9 billion. However, with declining revenue projections, the May Revision now estimates the 2025-26 minimum guarantee at $114.6 billion. This figure reflects a $4.3 billion decrease from the January estimate and is also $1.1 billion lower than the $115.7 billion estimate in the 2024-25 enacted budget.\n- While revenue projections grew for 2024-25, the Prop. 98 minimum guarantee estimate of $118.9 in the May Revision is slightly lower than the January projection. However, this $118.9 billion still represents an increase of $3.6 over the estimate in the June budget. Along with these updates, the maintenance factor obligation — a required payment as a result of the suspension in 2023-24 — is also likely to be adjusted. Despite this constitutionally required amount, the governor’s revised spending plan maintains a proposal to fund the guarantee at $117.6 billion in 2024-25, $1.3 billion lower. This approach aims to mitigate potential risks associated with revenue volatility by delaying the required amount until the guarantee’s final calculation for that year.\n- For the 2023-24 fiscal year, the guarantee’s level is maintained at $98.5. Since the guarantee was suspended with the 2024-25 budget, the 2023-24 level does not change.\nThe revised spending plan also makes an adjustment to a required deposit into the Public School System Stabilization Account (PSSSA) — also referred to as the Prop. 98 reserve. In 2024-25, the required deposit is $540 million, down from an estimated $1.1 billion deposit in January. Also, given the decline in Prop. 98, there’s now a mandatory withdrawal in 2025-26 of $540 million, fully drawing down this reserve (see Reserves section).\nThe revised budget also proposes changes to the share of Prop. 98 funds that go to TK-12 schools or the California Community Colleges. This proposal would shift the growth in Prop. 98 for Transitional Kindergarten expansion specifically to TK-12, essentially reducing the Community College’s portion by $492 million.\nRevised Spending Plan Largely Maintains TK-12 Programs\nThe largest share of Proposition 98 funds goes to California’s school districts, charter schools, and county offices of education (COEs), which provide instruction to 5.9 million students in grades kindergarten through 12. Funding flows primarily through the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), which provides school districts, charter schools, and COEs a base grant per student, adjusted to reflect the number of students at various grade levels, as well as additional grants for the costs of educating English learners, students from low-income families, and foster youth. Other funds flow through a number of categorical programs such as the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program, special education, and others.\nThe revised spending plan largely maintains proposals included in the January budget and includes additional one-time and ongoing investments. Specifically, the revised budget:\n- Provides a 2.3% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for the LCFF and other non-LCFF programs.\n- Maintains proposal to fully expand Transitional Kindergarten (TK).\n- Maintains a proposal for a new discretionary block grant.\n- Maintains proposal to expand access to the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELOP) for students in grades TK-6.\n- Maintains and increases support for the state’s comprehensive literacy and educator development strategy.\n- Makes adjustments to teacher preparation and recruitment proposals.\n- Increases funding for school nutrition programs.\n- Provides additional funds to support multilingual students.\nRevised Budget Scales Back Previously Proposed Initiatives at the Community Colleges\nA portion of Proposition 98 funding provides support to the California Community Colleges (CCCs), the largest postsecondary education system in the country, which serves high percentages of students of color and students with low incomes. CCCs prepare more than 1.8 million students to transfer to four-year institutions or to obtain training and employment skills.\nThe 2025-26 revised spending plan proposes to support a 2.3% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) and funding for a higher level of enrollment growth; however, it eliminates and reduces funding previously proposed for other CCC initiatives.\nSpecifically, the revised spending plan:\n- Allocates $217.5 million for a 2.3% COLA for CCC apportionments.\n- Funds a 2.35% enrollment growth.\n- Defers support for the Student Centered Funding Formula (SCFF).\n- Reduces one-time funding for several initiatives proposed in January.\nRevised Budget Maintains Deferrals for the CSU and UC, Reduces Previously Proposed Cuts\nCalifornia supports two public four-year higher education institutions: the California State University (CSU) and the University of California (UC). The CSU provides undergraduate and graduate education to nearly 454,000 students at 23 campuses, and the UC provides undergraduate, graduate, and professional education to more than 294,000 students across 10 campuses.\nThe 2025-26 May Revision maintains the planned deferral of funding increases to the UC ($240 million) and CSU ($252 million) systems from 2025-26 to 2027-28. This funding was supposed to be part of multi-year investments established through agreements between the administration and the CSU and UC systems in 2022. These agreements (also known as compacts) outlined major goals, including increasing access, improving student success and advancing equity, increasing affordability, improving collaboration among systems of higher education, and supporting workforce preparedness.\nThe revised spending plan also decreases previously proposed ongoing reductions for both systems. The January budget proposal included a 7.95% cut — $375 million for CSU and $397 million for UC — in ongoing General Fund support for UC & CSU systems beginning in the 2025-26 fiscal year. The May Revision reduces this cut down to $144 million for the CSU and $130 million for the UC, reflecting about a 3% reduction to each of the systems.\nAdditionally, for the UC system, the revised budget maintains a planned deferral of $31 million General Fund dollars from 2025-26 to 2027-28 that would have supported the UC in increasing the number of resident undergraduate students.\nRevised State Budget Adjusts Student Aid as Federal Threats Emerge\nStudents pursuing postsecondary education often face significant financial hardship, struggling to afford basic necessities while attending college. These challenges can lead to difficult trade-offs that affect their academic experience, delay their progress, or force them to abandon their educational goals entirely. These realities highlight the critical need for state support to ensure students have the resources necessary to complete their degrees.\nThe May Revision makes several adjustments to programs administered by the California Student Aid Commission. Specifically, the revised spending plan:\n- Increases support for the Cal Grant program, the state’s financial aid program for low-income students.\n- Increases support for the Middle Class Scholarship (MCS).\n- Adjusts funding for the Golden State Teacher Grant Program.\nWhile these proposed adjustments will certainly provide needed funds to maintain aid to students, they come at a time of growing federal threats to Pell Grants and student loans. House Republicans outlined a plan to limit Pell Grants — which support low- and middle-income students attending public institutions, including the California Community Colleges, UC, and CSU campuses — and to impose drastic changes to the student loan system, including restricting repayment options and making it more complicated to apply. These proposals could significantly impact students across all segments of California’s public higher education system.\nJustice System\nMay Revision Calls for Closing an Additional State Prison by October 2026\nNearly 90,800 adults convicted of a felony offense are serving their sentences at the state level, down from a peak of 173,600 in 2007. This sizable drop in incarceration is largely due to a series of justice system reforms adopted by state policymakers and the voters since the late 2000s, including Proposition 47, which California voters passed in 2014 (see Prop. 47 investments section).\nDespite this substantial progress in reducing incarceration, American Indian, Black, and Latinx Californians are disproportionately represented in state prisons — a disparity that reflects racist practices in the justice system as well as the social and economic disadvantages that communities of color continue to face due to historical and ongoing discrimination and exclusion.\nAmong all incarcerated adults, most — around 87,600 — are housed in state prisons designed to hold roughly 71,700 people. This overcrowding equals 122% of the prison system’s “design capacity,” which is below the prison population cap — 137.5% of design capacity — established by a 2009 federal court order. California also houses around 3,200 people in facilities that are not subject to the cap, including fire camps, in-state “contract beds,” and community-based facilities that provide rehabilitative services.\nThe May Revision:\n- Calls for closing an additional state prison by October 2026, for ongoing state General Fund savings of around $150 million per year.\n- Projects that the state prison population will temporarily rise due to Proposition 36 before resuming its long-term decline.\n- Provides $13.4 billion General Fund for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) in 2025-26, down from an estimated $14 billion for the current fiscal year (2024-25).\n- Withdraws or modifies various CDCR proposals advanced by the governor in January in order to help close the state budget shortfall.\n- Assumes additional, but unspecified, reductions to CDCR’s budget totaling $125 million in 2025-26 and growing to over $600 million in 2027-28.\nRevised Budget Includes Little Funding to Implement Proposition 36\nLast November voters approved Proposition 36, increasing penalties for certain drug and theft offenses. For example, Prop. 36 reversed some of the sentencing reforms put in place by Prop. 47 of 2014 (see Prop. 47 Investments section). In addition, Prop. 36 established a new process allowing prosecutors to charge people with a “treatment-mandated felony” for possession of illegal drugs. Yet, even with the passage of Prop. 36, most of the justice system reforms adopted by state policymakers and voters over the past couple of decades remain in effect.\nBy increasing punishment for drug and theft crimes, Prop. 36 is creating new costs — including for incarceration, probation, and the courts — at the state and local levels. However, Prop. 36 amounts to a massive unfunded mandate. The measure provides no new revenue to pay for these additional state and local costs — even though Californians were promised that Prop. 36 would provide evidence-based treatment, housing solutions, and programs to increase community health and safety. Instead, Prop. 36 assumes that state and local officials will be able to accommodate the measure’s substantial costs in their already strained budgets.\nAs a result, state and local leaders face difficult choices about how to pay for the unfunded costs created by Prop. 36 even as they are struggling to close substantial budget deficits for the upcoming fiscal year and beyond.\nThe May Revision does not include any new state funding to implement Prop. 36 beyond the funds needed to support higher state prison costs. The revised budget increases prison spending by about $29 million in 2025-26 to reflect a larger state prison population due to Prop. 36, according to Department of Finance testimony provided to Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Subcommittee #5 on May 15. However, the May Revision does not propose any new additional state funding to support the service needs and other unfunded costs imposed by Prop. 36 — costs that could easily reach to the low hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\nMay Revision Projects Steep Drop in Proposition 47 Savings in Coming Years\nPassed by voters in 2014, Proposition 47 reduced penalties for six nonviolent drug and property crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. As a result, state prison generally has not been a sentencing option for these crimes. Instead, people convicted of a Prop. 47 offense have served their sentence in county jail and/or received probation.\nHowever, with the passage of Prop. 36 last November, some of Prop. 47’s sentencing reforms have been reversed. Key changes enacted by Prop. 36 as well as their potential impact are described at the end of this section.\nHow Prop. 47 Savings Are Determined and Allocated\nBy decreasing state-level incarceration over the past decade, Prop. 47 reduced the cost of the prison system relative to the expected cost if Prop. 47 had not been approved by voters. The Department of Finance is required to annually calculate these state savings, which are deposited into the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund and used as follows:\n- 65% for behavioral health services — which includes mental health services and substance use treatment — as well as diversion programs for individuals who have been arrested, charged, or convicted of crimes. These funds are distributed as competitive grants administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections.\n- 25% for K-12 school programs to support vulnerable youth. These funds are distributed as competitive grants administered by the California Department of Education.\n- 10% to trauma recovery services for crime victims. These funds are distributed as competitive grants administered by the California Victim Compensation Board.\nCalifornia Has Allocated $816 Million in Prop. 47 Savings to Date\nSince 2016, California has allocated $816 million in state prison savings attributable to Prop. 47. These funds have been invested in local programs that support healing and keep communities safe. For example, research shows that people who received Prop. 47-funded behavioral health services and/or participated in diversion programs were much less likely to be convicted of a new crime. Individuals enrolled in these programs had a recidivism rate of just 15.3% — two to three times lower than is typical for people who serve prison sentences (recidivism rates range from 35% to 45% for these individuals).\nMay Revision Estimates That $91.5 Million in Prop. 47 Savings Will Be Available to Invest in Local Communities in 2025-26\nThe May Revision estimates that Prop. 47 will generate an additional $91.5 million in savings due to reduced state-level incarceration — dollars that will be invested in local communities starting in the 2025-26 fiscal year. (These savings are attributable to the 2024-25 fiscal year, but are available for expenditure in 2025-26.) With these additional funds, Prop. 47’s total investment in California’s communities will exceed $900 million, up from the current $816 million.\nProp. 47 Savings Are Projected to Decline Substantially Due to Prop. 36\nWith the recent passage of Prop. 36, voters increased penalties for certain drug and theft offenses, including by reversing some of Prop. 47’s sentencing reforms (see Prop. 36 section). For example, Prop. 36 allows simple drug possession, petty theft, and shoplifting to be charged as felonies in certain circumstances. Under Prop. 47’s rules, these crimes were generally misdemeanors.\nThe state prison population is expected to rise in the near term due to the longer sentences allowed by Prop. 36 (see State Corrections section). As a result, the annual savings attributable to Prop. 47 is projected to substantially decline. Budget documents project that annual Prop. 47 savings will decrease from $91.5 million in 2024-25 to $27.1 million in 2026-27 — a drop of $64.4 million (70%) over this two-year period.\nIn other words, because of Prop. 36, more than $64 million in state funding that would otherwise have supported behavioral health treatment and other critical services over the next two years is expected to be shifted back to the state prison system.\nClimate Change\nBudget Maintains Funding for Wildfire Relief and Recovery\nAs demonstrated by the devastating wildfires that swept through Los Angeles County earlier this year, as well as other disasters in recent years, Californians are deeply impacted by the effects of climate change. While the climate crisis affects all Californians, communities of color and low-income communities are often hit hardest due to historical and ongoing displacement and underinvestment.\nIn January, the governor signed legislation to provide over $2.5 billion in wildfire relief to Los Angeles County to help communities hit hard by the disastrous wildfires in the region. This funding included:\n- $2.5 billion for response and recovery efforts, including support for emergency protective measures, evacuations, and sheltering for survivors;\n- $4 million to expedite rebuilding homes in local communities; and\n- $1 million to rebuild local schools damaged by the wildfire.\nIn April, the governor signed into law “early action” legislation to use some of the funding approved in January as well as funding approved by voters in November through Proposition 4 for wildfire relief and prevention. This included:\n- Appropriating $181 million in Prop. 4 bond funds for wildfire prevention and resilience, including $170 million to conservancies for forest vegetation and management and $10 million to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to fund a tribal fire resiliency center.\n- Authorizing the Department of Finance to use funds approved in January to increase funding for unmet response and recovery needs from damage caused by the wildfires.\nThe governor’s May Revise maintains previously appropriated funding for relief to Los Angeles County from the wildfires suffered earlier this year. Additionally, the May Revise:\n- Includes an increase of $416.6 million to support recovery from natural disasters. These funds will be available to the Department of Housing and Community Development and reflect available federal dollars for recovery efforts from natural disasters in 2023 and 2024 (see Housing section).\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Bush administration.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] Methods used included beating, binding in contorted stress positions, hooding, subjection to deafening noise, sleep disruption,[9] sleep deprivation to the point of hallucination, deprivation of food, drink, and medical care for wounds, as well as waterboarding, walling, sexual humiliation, rape, sexual assault, subjection to extreme heat or extreme cold, and confinement in small coffin-like boxes.[10][11][12][13] A Guantanamo inmate's drawings of some of these tortures, to which he himself was subjected, were published in The New York Times.[14] Some of these techniques fall under the category known as \"white room torture\".[15] Several detainees endured medically unnecessary[16] \"rectal rehydration\", \"rectal fluid resuscitation\", and \"rectal feeding\".[17][18] In addition to brutalizing detainees, there were threats to their families such as threats to harm children, and threats to sexually abuse or to cut the throat of detainees' mothers.[19]\nThe number of detainees subjected to these methods has never been authoritatively established, nor how many died as a result of the interrogation regime, though this number could be as high as 100.[20] The CIA admits to waterboarding three people implicated in the September 11 attacks: Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Mohammed al-Qahtani. A Senate Intelligence Committee found photos of a waterboard surrounded by buckets of water at the Salt Pit prison, where the CIA had claimed that waterboarding was never used.[21][22][23][24] Former guards and inmates at Guantánamo have said that deaths which the US military called suicides at the time, were in fact homicides under torture.[25] No murder charges have been brought for these or for acknowledged torture-related homicides at Abu Ghraib and at Bagram.[26]\nFrom the outset, there were concerns and allegations expressed that \"enhanced interrogation\" violated U.S. anti-torture statutes or international laws such as the UN Convention against Torture. In 2005, the CIA destroyed videotapes depicting prisoners being interrogated under torture; an internal justification was that what they showed was so horrific they would be \"devastating to the CIA\", and that \"the heat from destroying [the videotapes] is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into public domain\".[27][28][29][30] The United Nations special rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, stated that waterboarding is torture—\"immoral and illegal\", and in 2008, fifty-six Democratic Party members of the US Congress asked for an independent investigation.[31][32][33]\nAmerican and European officials including former CIA director Leon Panetta, former CIA officers, a Guantanamo prosecutor, and a military tribunal judge, have called \"enhanced interrogation\" a euphemism for torture.[34][35][36][37][38] In 2009, both President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder said that certain techniques amount to torture, and repudiated their use.[39][40] They declined to prosecute CIA, US Department of Defense, or Bush administration officials who authorized the program, while leaving open the possibility of convening an investigatory \"Truth Commission\" for what President Obama called a \"further accounting\".[41]\nIn July 2014, the European Court of Human Rights formally ruled that \"enhanced interrogation\" was tantamount to torture, and ordered Poland to pay restitution to men tortured at a CIA black site there.[42] In December 2014, the U.S. Senate published around 10% of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture, a report about the CIA's use of torture during the George W. Bush administration.\nHistory of approval by the Bush administration\n[edit]Almost immediately after the 9/11 attacks, Bush administration officials conferring by video link from bunkers decided to treat the attacks as acts of war, rather than crimes.[43] The question arose: were captured prisoners to be treated as prisoners of war? Officials including Justice Department lawyer John Yoo recommended classifying them as \"detainees\" outside the protection of the Geneva Conventions or any other domestic or military law, and incarcerating them in special prisons instead of the barracks-like \"prisoner-of-war camp you saw in Hogan's Heroes or Stalag 17.\"[43] On September 17, 2001, President Bush signed a still-classified directive giving the CIA the power to secretly imprison and interrogate detainees.[44]\nIn late 2001, the first detainees including men like Murat Kurnaz and Lakhdar Boumediene, later established to be innocent and arrested on flawed intelligence or sold to the CIA for bounties, were brought to hastily improvised CIA/military bases such as Kandahar, Afghanistan.[45] They were subjected to beatings, electric shocks, exposure to extreme cold, suspension from the ceiling by their arms, and drowning in buckets of water.[46] An unknown number died as a result.[47][48] In late 2001 and early 2002, interrogation under torture at secret sites was still ad hoc, not yet organized as a bureaucratic program, nor sanctioned under US Justice Department legal cover.[49]\nAs early as November 2001, the CIA general counsel began considering the legality of torture, writing that \"the Israeli example\" (using physical force against hundreds of detainees) could serve as \"a possible basis for arguing ... torture was necessary to prevent imminent, significant, physical harm to persons, where there is no other available means to prevent the harm.\"[50]\nIn April 2002, the CIA had captured its first important prisoner, Abu Zubaydah, who was transferred to a CIA black site and at the suggestion of psychologist James Mitchell the CIA embarked on interrogation methods which included sleep deprivation using bright lights and loud music – still prior to any legal authorization from the US Justice Department.[51] Later that April, Mitchell proposed a list of additional tactics, including locking people in cramped boxes, shackling them in painful positions, keeping them awake for a week at a time, covering them with insects, and waterboarding, a practice which the United States had previously characterized in war crimes prosecutions as torture.[51][52][53]\nJose Rodriguez, head of the CIA's clandestine service, asked his superiors for authorization for what Rodriguez called an \"alternative set of interrogation procedures\".[54] The CIA sought immunity from prosecution, sometimes known as a \"get out of jail free card\".[55]\nIn May 2002, senior Bush administration officials including CIA director George Tenet, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and Attorney General John Ashcroft met to discuss which techniques the CIA could legally use against Abu Zubaydah.[56][57] Condoleezza Rice recalled \"being told that U.S. military personnel were subjected in training to certain physical and psychological interrogation techniques\".[56][58] During the discussions, John Ashcroft is reported to have said, \"Why are we talking about this in the White House? History will not judge this kindly.\"[57]\nJay Bybee, head of the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, collaborated with John Yoo to draft and sign what are now known as the Torture Memos. These classified memoranda legalized a number of torture techniques for use on detainees by very narrowly defining torture and expansively defining executive authority. After the Justice Department completed the Torture Memos, Condoleezza Rice told the CIA that the techniques were approved in July 2002.[55][59][60] Dick Cheney said \"I signed off on it; so did others.\"[60][61] In 2010 Cheney said, \"I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program.\"[62] In 2009 Rice said \"[w]e never tortured anyone\"; she maintained the abuse was \"not torture\", but was \"legal\", and \"right\".[63][64]\nIn addition, in 2002 and 2003, the CIA says they briefed several Democratic Party congressional leaders on the proposed \"enhanced interrogation technique\" program.[65] These congressional leaders included Nancy Pelosi, the future Speaker of the House, and House Intelligence Committee Ranking Democrat Jane Harman.[65] The response to the briefings was \"quiet acquiescence, if not downright support\", according to officials present.[65] Harman was the only congressional leader to object to the tactics being proposed.[66] Former senator Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate intelligence committee after the 9/11 attacks, said he was not briefed on waterboarding and that in three instances agency officials said he'd attended briefings on days that his personal journal shows he was elsewhere.[67]\nAt least one Bush administration official opposed torturing prisoners, Condoleezza Rice's most senior adviser Philip Zelikow.[68] Upon learning details of the program, Zelikow wrote a memo to Rice contesting the Justice Department's Torture Memos, believing them wrong both legally and as a matter of policy.[68] Zelikow's memo warned that the interrogation techniques breached US law, and could lead to prosecutions for war crimes.[35][69] The Bush administration attempted to collect all the copies of Zelikow's memo and destroy them.[68][70][71] Jane Mayer, author of The Dark Side,[72] quotes Zelikow as predicting that \"America's descent into torture will in time be viewed like the Japanese internments\", in that \"(f)ear and anxiety were exploited by zealots and fools.\"[73]\nDevelopment of techniques and training\n[edit]The authorized \"enhanced interrogation\" (the originator of this term is unknown, but it appears to be a calque of the German \"Verschärfte Vernehmung \", meaning \"intensified interrogation\", used in 1937 by Gestapo chief Heinrich Müller[74]) was based on work done by James Elmer Mitchell and Bruce Jessen in the Air Force's Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) program.[72][75][76][77][78][79] The CIA contracted with the two psychologists to develop alternative, harsh interrogation techniques.[72][75][76][77][78] However, neither of the two psychologists had any experience in conducting interrogations.[76][77][78][80] Air Force Reserve Colonel Steve Kleinman stated that the CIA \"chose two clinical psychologists who had no intelligence background whatsoever, who had never conducted an interrogation ... to do something that had never been proven in the real world.\"[77][78][80] Associates of Mitchell and Jessen were skeptical of their methods and believed they did not possess any data about the impact of SERE training on the human psyche.[78] The CIA came to learn that Mitchell and Jessen's expertise in waterboarding was probably \"misrepresented\", and thus there was no reason to believe it was medically safe or effective.[76] Despite these shortcomings of experience and know-how, the two psychologists boasted of being paid $1,000 a day (equivalent to $1,750 in 2024) plus expenses, tax-free by the CIA for their work.[76][77][78]\nThe SERE program, which Mitchell and Jessen would reverse engineer, was used to train pilots and other soldiers on how to resist \"brainwashing\" techniques assumed to have been employed by the Chinese to extract false confessions from captured Americans during the Korean War.[72][78][81] The program subjected trainees to \"waterboarding ... sleep deprivation, isolation, exposure to extreme temperatures, enclosure in tiny spaces, bombardment with agonizing sounds at extremely damaging decibel levels, and religious and sexual humiliation\",[82] including forced enemas[83] and other anal assault.[84] Under CIA supervision, Miller and Jessen adapted SERE into an offensive program designed to train CIA agents on how to use the harsh interrogation techniques to gather information from terrorist detainees.[72][75][78] In fact, all of the tactics listed above would later be reported in the International Committee of the Red Cross Report on Fourteen High Value Detainees in CIA Custody as having been used on Abu Zubaydah.[85][86]\nThe psychologists relied heavily on experiments done by American psychologist Martin Seligman in the 1970s on learned helplessness.[87] In these experiments caged dogs were exposed to severe electric shocks in a random way in order to completely break their will to resist.[87] Mitchell and Jessen applied this idea to the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah.[72][87] Many of the interrogation techniques used in the SERE program, including waterboarding, cold cell, long-time standing, and sleep deprivation were previously considered illegal under U.S. and international law and treaties at the time of Abu Zubaydah's capture.[88][89] In fact, the United States had prosecuted Japanese military officials after World War II and American soldiers after the Vietnam War for waterboarding.[89] In 1983, Texas Sheriff James Parker \"was charged, along with three of his deputies, for handcuffing prisoners to chairs, placing towels over their faces, and pouring water on the cloth until they gave what the officers considered to be confessions. The sheriff and his deputies were all convicted and sentenced to four years in prison.\"[52] Since 1930, the United States had defined sleep deprivation as an illegal form of torture.[72] Many other techniques developed by the CIA constitute inhuman and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.[88]\nAccording to Human Rights First:\nInternal FBI memos and press reports have pointed to SERE training as the basis for some of the harshest techniques authorised for use on detainees by the Pentagon in 2002 and 2003.[90]\nAnd Salon stated:\nA March 22, 2005, sworn statement by the former chief of the Interrogation Control Element at Guantánamo said instructors from SERE also taught their methods to interrogators of the prisoners in Cuba.[91]\nWhile Jane Mayer reported for The New Yorker:\nAccording to the SERE affiliate and two other sources familiar with the program, after September 11 several psychologists versed in SERE techniques began advising interrogators at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere. Some of these psychologists essentially \"tried to reverse-engineer\" the SERE program, as the affiliate put it. \"They took good knowledge and used it in a bad way\", another of the sources said. Interrogators and BSCT members at Guantánamo adopted coercive techniques similar to those employed in the SERE program.[92]\nand continues to report:\nmany of the interrogation methods used in SERE training seem to have been applied at Guantánamo.\"[93][94][95]\nA bipartisan report released in 2008 stated that:\na February 2002 memorandum signed by President George W. Bush, stating that the Third Geneva Convention guaranteeing humane treatment to prisoners of war did not apply to al-Qaeda or Taliban detainees, and a December 2002 memo signed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, approving the use of \"aggressive techniques\" against detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, as key factors that lead to the extensive abuses.[96]\nHowever, the Bush administration's February 2002 memorandum had, in fact, stated that only al-Qaeda detainees were not covered by the Geneva Conventions. That same order held that Taliban detainees would be entitled to treatment under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.[97][98] These standards were ordered for all detainees in 2006, al-Qaeda members included, following the Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.[99]\nDonald Rumsfeld rescinded his December 2002 memo after six weeks.[100]\nCommon Article 3 remained the policy under the Obama administration, and not the balance of the Third Geneva Convention.[101]\nCentral Intelligence Agency\n[edit]A Congressional bipartisan report in December 2008[96] established that:\nharsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA and the U.S. military were directly adapted from the training techniques used to prepare special forces personnel to resist interrogation by enemies that torture and abuse prisoners. The techniques included forced nudity, painful stress positions, sleep deprivation, and until 2003, waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning.\nAccording to ABC News,[102] former and current CIA officials have come forward to reveal details of interrogation techniques authorized in the CIA. These include:\n- Waterboarding: The prisoner is bound to a declined board, feet raised and head slightly below the feet. Material is wrapped over the prisoner's face and water is poured over them, asphyxiating the prisoner.\n- Hypothermia: The prisoner is left to stand naked in a cell kept near 50 °F (10 °C), while being regularly doused with cold water in order to increase the rate at which heat is lost from the body.\n- Stress positions: Prisoners are forced to stand, handcuffed and with their feet shackled to an eye bolt in the floor (and/or wall), for more than 40 hours, causing the prisoners' weight to be placed on just one or two muscles. This creates an intense amount of pressure on the legs, leading first to pain and then muscle failure.\n- Abdomen strikes: A hard, open-handed slap is dealt to the prisoner's abdomen. Doctors consulted over the matter advised against using a punch, which could cause lasting internal damage.\n- Insult slap: An open-handed slap is delivered to the prisoner's face, aimed at causing pain and triggering fear.\n- Shaking: The interrogator forcefully grabs the front of the prisoner's shirt and shakes the prisoner.\nIn December 2007, CIA director Michael Hayden stated that \"of about 100 prisoners held to date in the CIA program, the enhanced techniques were used on about 30, and waterboarding used on just three.\"[103][104]\nThe report, \"Experiments in Torture: Human Subject Research and Evidence of Experimentation in the 'Enhanced' Interrogation Program\", published by the advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights, described personnel in the CIA's Office of Medical Services (OMS) performing research on the prisoners as the above techniques were used both serially and in combination.[105] This report was based on previously classified documents made available by the Obama administration in 2010.\nAccording to ABC news in 2007, the CIA removed waterboarding from its list of acceptable interrogation techniques in 2006. ABC stated further that the last use of waterboarding was in 2003.[106]\nDefense Intelligence Agency\n[edit]In 2003, the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's \"Working Group\" on interrogations requested that the DIA come up with prisoner interrogation techniques for the group's consideration. According to the 2008 U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee report on the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, the DIA began drawing up the list of techniques with the help of its civilian employee, a former Guantanamo Interrogation Control Element (ICE) Chief David Becker. Becker claimed that the Working Group members were particularly interested in aggressive methods and that he \"was encouraged to talk about techniques that inflict pain.\"[107]: 111\nBecker claimed that he recommended the use of drugs due to rumors that another intelligence agency, name of which was redacted in the Senate report, had successfully used them in the past.[107]: 112 According to the analysis of the Office of Defense Inspector General, the DIA's cited justification for the use of drugs was to \"[relax] detainee to cooperative state\" and that mind-altering substances were not used.[108]\nSome more lurid revelations of DIA's harsh interrogations came from FBI officers, who conducted their own screenings of detainees in Guantanamo along with other agencies. According to one account, the interrogators of what was then DIA's Defense HUMINT Service (currently the Defense Clandestine Service), forced subjects to watch gay porn, draped them with the Israeli Flag and interrogated them in rooms lit by strobe lights for 16–18 hours, all the while telling prisoners that they were from the FBI.[109][110]\nThe real FBI operative was concerned that DIA's harsh methods and impersonation of FBI agents would complicate the Bureau's ability to do its job properly, saying \"The next time a real Agent tries to talk to that guy, you can imagine the result.\"[109] A subsequent military inquiry countered FBI's allegations by saying that the prisoner treatment was degrading but not inhuman, without addressing the allegation of DIA staff regularly impersonating FBI officers—usually a felony offense.[111] A year before this investigation was concluded, it was revealed that interrogations by special units of the U.S. military services were much harsher and more physical than any of the above DIA practices, to the point that 2 DIA officials reportedly complained, after which they were threatened by non-DIA interrogators.[112]\nSimilar activities are thought to have transpired at the hands of DIA operatives in Bagram, where as recently as 2010 the organization ran the so-called \"Black jail\". According to a report published by The Atlantic, the jail was manned by DIA's DCHC staff, who were accused of beating and sexually humiliating high-value targets held at the site.[113] The detention center outlived the black sites ran by the Central Intelligence Agency, with the DIA continuing to use \"restricted\" interrogation methods in the facility under a secret authorization. It is unclear what happened to the secret facility after the 2013 transfer of the base to Afghan authorities following several postponements.[114]\nU.S. Armed Forces\n[edit]The following techniques were authorized by the U.S. military:[100][116]\n- Yelling\n- Loud music, and light control\n- Environmental manipulation\n- Sleep deprivation/adjustment\n- Stress positions\n- 20-hour interrogations\n- Controlled fear (including use of dogs)\nIn November 2006, former U.S. Army Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, in charge of Abu Ghraib prison until early 2004, reported seeing a letter apparently signed by United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that allowed contractors employed by the U.S. to use techniques such as sleep deprivation during interrogation.[117] Karpinski stated that the \"methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit uncomfortably\" and that \"Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques.\"[117] She said that she considered this treatment to be contrary to the Geneva Conventions, which state \"Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\" According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name and in the same handwriting in the margin was written, \"Make sure this is accomplished.\"[117][118]\nOn May 1, 2005, The New York Times reported on an ongoing high-level military investigation into accusations of detainee abuse at Guantánamo, conducted by Lieutenant General Randall M. Schmidt of the Air Force, and dealing with: \"accounts by agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who complained after witnessing detainees subjected to several forms of harsh treatment. The FBI agents wrote in memorandums that were never meant to be disclosed publicly that they had seen female interrogators forcibly squeeze male prisoners' genitals, and that they had witnessed other detainees stripped and shackled low to the floor for many hours.\"[119]\nOn July 12, 2005, members of a military panel told the committee that they proposed disciplining prison commander Major General Geoffrey Miller over the interrogation of Mohammed al Qahtani, who was forced to wear a bra, dance with another man, and threatened with dogs. The recommendation was overruled by General Bantz J. Craddock, commander of U.S. Southern Command, who referred the matter to the army's inspector general.[120]\nIn an interview with AP on February 14, 2008, Paul Rester, chief military interrogator at Guantanamo Bay and director of the Joint Intelligence Group, said most of the information gathered from detainees came from non-coercive questioning and \"rapport building\", not harsh interrogation methods.[93]\nAmerican Psychological Association\n[edit]The American Psychological Association (APA), the primary professional organization of psychologists in the United States, collaborated with the Bush administration in secret to write legal and ethical justifications for the torture.[121]\nInitial reports and complaints\n[edit]In 2006, senior law enforcement agents with the Criminal Investigation Task Force told MSNBC.com that they began to complain in 2002 inside the U.S. Department of Defense that the interrogation tactics used in Guantanamo Bay by a separate team of military intelligence investigators were unproductive, not likely to produce reliable information, and probably illegal. Unable to get satisfaction from the army commanders running the detainee camp, they took their concerns to David Brant, director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), who alerted Navy General Counsel Alberto J. Mora.[122]\nGeneral Counsel Mora and Navy Judge Advocate General Michael Lohr believed the detainee treatment to be unlawful, and campaigned among other top lawyers and officials in the Defense Department to investigate, and to provide clear standards prohibiting coercive interrogation tactics.[123] In response, on January 15, 2003, Rumsfeld suspended the approved interrogation tactics at Guantánamo Bay until a new set of guidelines could be produced by a working group headed by General Counsel of the Air Force Mary Walker.\nThe working group based its new guidelines on a legal memo from the United States Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel written by John Yoo and signed by Jay S. Bybee in August 2002, which would later become widely known as the \"Torture Memo\". General Counsel Mora led a faction of the Working Group in arguing against these standards, and argued the issues with Yoo in person. The working group's final report was signed and delivered to Guantánamo without the knowledge of Mora and the others who had opposed its content. Mora has maintained that detainee treatment has been consistent with the law since the January 15, 2003, suspension of previously approved interrogation tactics.[124]\nIt was not known publicly until 2008 that Yoo wrote another legal opinion, dated March 14, 2003, which he issued to the General Counsel of DOD, five days before the invasion of Iraq started. In it, he concluded that federal laws related to torture and other abuse did not apply to interrogators overseas – which at that time the administration applied to Guantanamo as well as locations such as Iraq.[citation needed]\nPublic positions and reactions\n[edit]President Bush stated \"The United States of America does not torture. And that's important for people around the world to understand.\"[125] The administration adopted the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 to address the multitude of incidents of detainee abuse. However, in his signing statement, Bush made clear that he reserved the right to waive this bill if he thought that was needed.[126][127]\nPorter Goss, the Director of Central Intelligence, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 17, 2005, described waterboarding as falling into the area of \"professional interrogation techniques\", differentiating them from torture.[128]\nThe Washington Post reported in January 2009 that Susan J. Crawford, convening authority of military commissions, stated about the interrogation of Mohammed al-Qahtani, one of the alleged \"20th hijackers\" of the September 11 attacks:\nThe techniques they used were all authorized, but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent. ... You think of torture, you think of some horrendous physical act done to an individual. This was not any one particular act; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him, that hurt his health. It was abusive and uncalled for. And coercive. Clearly coercive. It was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge [i.e., to call it torture].[129]\nCrawford decided not to prosecute al-Qahtani because his treatment fell within the definition of torture, so evidence was tainted by it having been gained through coercion.[129]\nFormer President Bush in his published memoirs[130] defends the utility of \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques and continues to assert that they are not torture.[131]\nFormer President Obama, former Attorney General Holder, and Guantanamo military prosecutor Crawford have called the techniques torture.[39] The British government has determined the techniques would be classified as torture, and dismissed President Bush's claim to the contrary.[131][132] A report by Human Rights First (HRF) and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) stated that these techniques constitute torture.[133] \"A United Nations report denounced the US abuse of prisoners as tantamount to torture.[134] The UN report called for cessation of the US-termed \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques, as the UN sees these methods as a form of torture. The UN report also admonishes against secret prisons, the use of which, is considered to amount to torture as well and should be discontinued.[135]\nIn 2009, Paul Kane of The Washington Post said that the press was hesitant to define these techniques as torture, as it is a crime and nobody who engaged in \"enhanced interrogation\" has been charged or convicted.[136] In the summer of 2009, NPR decided to ban using the word torture[137] in what was a controversial act. Its Ombudsman Alicia Shepard's defense of the policy was that \"calling waterboarding torture is tantamount to taking sides.\"[138] However, Berkeley Professor of Linguistics, Geoffrey Nunberg, pointed out that virtually all media around the world, other than what he called the \"spineless U.S. media\", call these techniques torture.[139][140]\nTerminology\n[edit]Critics have referred to the term 'enhanced interrogation' as a euphemism[141][142] and Orwellian.[143] in order to disguise the brutal reality of torture by using \"unclear language\".[144]\nEffectiveness and reliability\n[edit]Senate Intelligence Committee report\n[edit]On December 9, 2014, United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) released a 525-page document containing the key findings and an executive summary, of their report into the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.[145] The remainder of the 6,000-page report remains classified.[146][147][148] The report concluded that the interrogation techniques were far more vicious and widespread than the CIA had previously reported; that \"brutality, dishonesty and seemingly arbitrary violence at times brought even [CIA] employees to moments of anguish.\"[149] The report said that CIA officials had deceived their superiors at the White House, members of Congress and even sometimes their peers about how the interrogation program was being run and what it had achieved.[149]\nThe executive summary lists 20 key findings:[150]\n- The CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.\n- The CIA's justification for the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques rested on inaccurate claims of their effectiveness.\n- The interrogations of CIA detainees were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others.\n- The conditions of confinement for CIA detainees were harsher than the CIA had represented to policymakers and others.\n- The CIA repeatedly provided inaccurate information to the Department of Justice, impeding a proper legal analysis of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.\n- The CIA has actively avoided or impeded congressional oversight of the program.\n- The CIA impeded effective White House oversight and decision-making.\n- The CIA's operation and management of the program complicated, and in some cases impeded, the national security missions of other Executive Branch agencies.\n- The CIA impeded oversight by the CIA's Office of Inspector General.\n- The CIA coordinated the release of classified information to the media, including inaccurate information concerning the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.\n- The CIA was unprepared as it began operating its Detention and Interrogation Program more than six months after being granted detention authorities.\n- The CIA's management and operation of its Detention and Interrogation Program was deeply flawed throughout the program's duration, particularly so in 2002 and early 2003.\n- Two contract psychologists devised the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and played a central role in the operation, assessments, and management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. By 2005, the CIA had overwhelmingly outsourced operations related to the program.\n- CIA detainees were subjected to coercive interrogation techniques that had not been approved by the Department of Justice or had not been authorized by CIA Headquarters.\n- The CIA did not conduct a comprehensive or accurate accounting of the number of individuals it detained, and held individuals who did not meet the legal standard for detention. The CIA's claims about the number of detainees held and subjected to its enhanced interrogation techniques were inaccurate.\n- The CIA failed to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of its enhanced interrogation techniques.\n- The CIA rarely reprimanded or held personnel accountable for serious or significant violations, inappropriate activities, and systematic and individual management failures.\n- The CIA marginalized and ignored numerous internal critiques, criticisms, and objections concerning the operation and management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.\n- The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program was inherently unsustainable and had effectively ended by 2006 due to unauthorized press disclosures, reduced cooperation from other nations, and legal and oversight concerns.\n- The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program damaged the United States' standing in the world, and resulted in other significant monetary and non-monetary costs.\nThe Senate Report examined in detail specifically whether torture provided information helpful in locating Osama Bin Laden, and concluded that it did not, and that the CIA deliberately misled political leaders and the public in saying it had.[151][152]\nThe three former CIA directors George Tenet, Porter Goss, and Michael Hayden, who had supervised the program during their tenure, objected to the Senate Report in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece, calling it poorly done and partisan.[153] They insisted that some information derived from the CIA program was useful, specifically that interrogation techniques made some detainees compliant and that the \"information provided by the totality of detainees in CIA custody\" had led to Osama Bin Laden.[153] According to the CIA, enhanced interrogation \"conditions\" were used for security and \"other valid reasons, such as to create an environment conducive to transitioning captured and resistant terrorist (sic) to detainees participating in debriefings.\"[154]\nRepublican Senator John McCain, citing Obama Administration CIA director Leon Panetta (who did not join with the others in the Wall Street Journal Op-ed) had previously said that brutality produced no useful information in the hunt for Osama Bin Laden; leads were \"obtained through standard, noncoercive means\".[155] In May 2011, Panetta had written to Senator McCain, that:\nwe first learned about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. It is also important to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.[156]\nIn 2014, Panetta wrote that torture did produce some useful information, but that the product was not worth the price, and if asked whether America should engage in similar practices he would say \"no\".[157] Obama Administration CIA director John Brennan said that it is \"unknowable\" whether brutality helped or hindered in the collection of useful intelligence.[158] White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said whether information derived from CIA torture may have helped find Osama Bin Laden, President Obama believes \"the use of these techniques was not worth it because of the harm that was done to our national values and the sense of what we believe in as Americans.\"[159] Similarly, Republican McCain agreed with Democrat Dianne Feinstein in remarks on the Senate floor that torture \"stained our national honor\" and did \"much harm and little practical good\".[160][161]\nInternal CIA assessments of efficacy\n[edit]Panetta Review\n[edit]The Panetta Review was a review begun in 2009 by the CIA that examined the use of torture during interrogations of detainees. The review was described as \"particularly scorching ... of extreme interrogation methods like waterboarding, which the memos described as providing little intelligence of any value.\"[162]\n2015 review\n[edit]On request by the National Security Advisor Susan Rice in 2015, the CIA compiled a summary of key intelligence, which according to their records had been collected after the application of (unspecified) interrogation techniques. The memorandum lists intelligence related to the following topics: The Karachi Plot, The Heathrow Plot, The \"Second Wave\", The Guraba Cell, Issa al-Hindi, Abu Talha al-Pakistani, Hambali's Capture, Jafaar al-Tayyar, Dirty Bomb Plot, Shoe bomber, and Sh(a)kai (Pakistan). The CIA concluded that the enhanced interrogation techniques had been effective in providing intelligence and has been a key reason why al-Qa'ida has failed to launch a spectacular attack in the West since September 11, 2001.[163]\nDestruction of videotapes\n[edit]In December 2007 it became known that the CIA had destroyed many videotapes recording the interrogation of prisoners. Disclosures in 2010 revealed that Jose Rodriguez Jr., head of the directorate of operations at the CIA from 2004 to 2007, ordered the tapes destroyed because he thought they would be \"devastating to the CIA\", and that \"the heat from destroying [the videotapes] is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into public domain.\"[164] The New York Times reported that according to \"some insiders\", an inquiry into the C.I.A.'s secret detention program which analyzed these techniques, \"might end with criminal charges for abusive interrogations.\"[165] In an op-ed for The New York Times, Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, chair and vice chair of the 9/11 Commission, stated:\nAs a legal matter, it is not up to us to examine the C.I.A.'s failure to disclose the existence of these tapes. That is for others. What we do know is that government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one (of) the greatest tragedies to confront this country. We call that obstruction.[166][167]\nResponding to the so-called \"torture memoranda\" Scott Horton noted:\nthe possibility that the authors of these memoranda counseled the use of lethal and unlawful techniques, and therefore face criminal culpability themselves. That, after all, is the teaching of United States v. Altstötter, the Nuremberg case brought against German Justice Department lawyers whose memoranda crafted the basis for implementation of the infamous \"Night and Fog Decree\".[168]\nJordan Paust concurred by responding to Mukasey's refusal to investigate and/or prosecute anyone that relied on these legal opinions\nit is legally and morally impossible for any member of the executive branch to be acting lawfully or within the scope of his or her authority while following OLC opinions that are manifestly inconsistent with or violative of the law. General Mukasey, just following orders is no defense![169]\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross report\n[edit]On March 15, 2009, Mark Danner provided a report in the New York Review of Books (with an abridged version in The New York Times) describing and commenting on the contents of a report by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Report on the Treatment of Fourteen \"High Value Detainees\" in CIA Custody (43 pp., February 2007). Report ... is a record of interviews with black site detainees, conducted between October 6 and 11 and December 4 and 14, 2006, after their transfer to Guantánamo.[170][171][172] (According to Danner, the report was marked \"confidential\" and was not previously made public before being made available to him.)\nDanner provides excerpts of interviews with detainees, including Abu Zubaydah, Walid bin Attash, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. According to Danner, the report contains sections on \"methods of ill-treatment\" including suffocation by water, prolonged stress standing, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation and use of loud music, exposure to cold temperature/cold water, prolonged use of handcuffs and shackles, threats, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food. Danner quotes the ICRC report as saying that, \"in many cases, the ill-treatment to which they were subjected while held in the CIA program, either singly or in combination, constituted torture. In addition, many other elements of the ill-treatment, either singly or in combination, constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\"[170]\nA heavily redacted version of the November 8, 2006 meeting was released by the CIA on June 10, 2016. The report tells that the ICRC finds the detainees stories \"largely credible, having put much stock in the fact that the story each detainee told about his transfer, treatment and conditions of confinement was basically consistent, even though they had been incommunicado with each other throughout their detention by us [the CIA].\"[173]\nSenate Armed Services Committee report\n[edit]A bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee report,[107] released in part in December 2008 and in full in April 2009, concluded that the legal authorization of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" led directly to the abuse and killings of prisoners in US military facilities at Abu Ghraib, Bagram, and elsewhere.[174] Brutal abuse migrated from Guantanamo Bay to Afghanistan, then to Iraq and Abu Ghraib.[175][176] The report concludes that some authorized techniques including \"use of stress positions and sleep deprivation combined with other mistreatment\" caused or were direct contributing factors in the cases of several prisoners who were tortured to death.[177][178][179] The report also notes that authorizing abuse created the conditions for other, unauthorized abuse, by creating a legal and moral climate encouraging inhumane treatment.[179] The legal memos condoning \"enhanced interrogation\" had \"redefined torture\",[174] \"distorted the meaning and intent of anti-torture laws, [and] rationalized the abuse of detainees\",[179] conveying the message that \"physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment.\"[178] What followed was an \"erosion of standards dictating that detainees be treated humanely.\"[174]: xxix The report accused Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and his deputies of being, according to The Washington Post, directly responsible as the \"authors and chief promoters of harsh interrogation policies that disgraced the nation and undermined U.S. security.\"[180]\nComparison to the Gestapo interrogation method called 'Verschärfte Vernehmung'\n[edit]Atlantic Monthly writer Andrew Sullivan has pointed out similarities between the Gestapo interrogation method called 'Verschärfte Vernehmung ' and what the US called \"enhanced interrogation\".[74] He asserts the first use of a term comparable to \"enhanced interrogation\" was a 1937 memo by Gestapo Chief Heinrich Müller coining the phrase \"Verschärfte Vernehmung\", German for \"sharpened questioning\", \"intensified\" or \"enhanced interrogation\" to describe subjection to extreme cold, sleep deprivation, suspension in stress positions, and deliberate exhaustion among other techniques.[74] Sullivan reports that in 1948 Norway prosecuted German officials for what trial documents termed \"Verschärfte Vernehmung\" including subjection to cold water, and repeated beatings.[74] Sullivan concludes:\nThe very phrase used by the president to describe torture-that-isn't-somehow-torture – \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" – is a term originally coined by the Nazis. The techniques are indistinguishable. The methods were clearly understood in 1948 as war-crimes. The punishment for them was death.[74]\nEffect on United States reputation\n[edit]Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in assessing the effect of the Bush torture program on the reputation of the United States in the world, stated that the damage to U.S. reputation had been incalculable. \"No position taken has done more damage to the American reputation in the world – ever.\"[181]\nInvestigation and calls for prosecution\n[edit]Request for special counsel probe\n[edit]On June 8, 2008, fifty-six House Democrats asked for an independent investigation, raising the possibility that authorising these techniques may constitute a crime by Bush administration officials. The congressmen involved in calling for such an investigation included John Conyers, Jan Schakowsky, and Jerrold Nadler.[182]\nThe letter was addressed to Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey observing that:\ninformation indicates that the Bush administration may have systematically implemented, from the top down, detainee interrogation policies that constitute torture or otherwise violate the law. ... Because these apparent 'enhanced interrogation techniques' were used under cover of Justice Department legal opinions, the need for an outside special prosecutor is obvious.[182]\nAccording to The Washington Post the request was denied because Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey felt that \"officials acted in 'good faith' when they sought legal opinions, and that the lawyers who provided them used their best judgment.\"[183] The article also reported that \"[h]e warned that criminalizing the process could cause policymakers to second-guess themselves and 'harm our national security well into the future.'\"[183]\nAfter Cheney acknowledged his involvement in authorising these tactics[184] Senator Carl Levin, chair of the Armed Services Committee, a New York Times editorial, Glenn Greenwald and Scott Horton stressed the importance of a criminal investigation: \"A prosecutor should be appointed to consider criminal charges against top officials at the Pentagon and others involved in planning the abuse.\"[185][186][187][188]\nUnited Nations Convention Against Torture\n[edit]Shortly before the end of Bush's second term, news media in other countries were opining that under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the U.S. is obligated to hold those responsible to account under criminal law.[189]\nOn January 20, 2009, the United Nations special rapporteur on Torture, Professor Manfred Nowak, remarked on German television that – following the inauguration of President Barack Obama – George W. Bush no longer had head of state immunity, and that under international law, the U.S. is mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in these violations of the UN Convention Against Torture.[190][191] Law professor Dietmar Herz explained Nowak's comments by saying that under U.S. and international law former President Bush is criminally responsible for adopting torture as an interrogation tool.[190]\nBinyam Mohamed case\n[edit]On February 4, 2009, the High Court of England and Wales ruled that evidence of possible torture in the case of Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian-born British resident who was held in Guantanamo Bay until 2009, could not be disclosed to the public:\nas a result of a statement by David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, that if the evidence was disclosed the US would stop sharing intelligence with Britain. That would directly threaten the UK's national security, Miliband had told the court.[192][193]\nThe judges said they found it \"difficult to conceive\" the rationale for the US's objections to releasing the information, which contained \"no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters\". Adding, \"we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials\".[192]\nResponding to the ruling, David Davis, the Conservative MP and former Shadow Home Secretary, commented:\nThe ruling implies that torture has taken place in the [Binyam] Mohamed case, that British agencies may have been complicit, and further, that the United States government has threatened our high court that if it releases this information the US government will withdraw its intelligence cooperation with the United Kingdom.[192]\nThe High Court judges also stated in 2009, that a criminal investigation, by the UK's Attorney General, into possible torture had begun.[194]\nIn February 2010, the UK Court of Appeal ruled that material held by the UK Foreign Secretary must be made public. The judges also concluded that Binyam Mohamed had been subjected to \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by the United States authorities\" and that British Intelligence knew that Mohamed was being tortured by the CIA.[195]\nLegality\n[edit]Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. considered the U.S. torture policy \"the most dramatic, sustained, and radical challenge to the rule of law in American history.\"[181] After the disclosure of the use of the techniques, debates arose over the legality of the techniques—whether they had violated U.S. or international law.\nU.S. government\n[edit]Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, several memoranda analyzing the legality of various interrogation methods[196] were written by John Yoo from the Office of Legal Counsel. The memos, known today as the torture memos,[168][197] advocate enhanced interrogation techniques, while pointing out that avoiding the Geneva Conventions would reduce the possibility of prosecution under the US War Crimes Act of 1996 for actions taken in the war on terror.[198][199][200] In addition, a new US definition of torture was issued. Most actions that fall under the international definition do not fall within this new definition advocated by the U.S.[201][202][203]\nThe Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate US prohibitions against torture unless they \"have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering\", according to a previously secret US Justice Department memo released on July 24, 2008. The interrogator's \"good faith\" and \"honest belief\" that the interrogation will not cause such suffering protects the interrogator, the memo adds. \"Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture\", Jay Bybee, then the Assistant Attorney General, wrote in the memo, dated August 1, 2002, addressed to the CIA acting General Counsel John A. Rizzo. The initial release of 18-page memo was heavily redacted, with 10 of its 18 pages completely blacked out and only a few paragraphs visible on the others.\nAnother memo released on the same day advises that \"the waterboard\", does \"not violate the Torture Statute.\" It also cites a number of warnings against torture, including statements by President Bush and a then-new Supreme Court ruling \"which raises possible concerns about future US judicial review of the [interrogation] Program.\"\nA third memo instructs interrogators to keep records of sessions in which \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" are used. The memo is signed by then-CIA director George Tenet and dated January 28, 2003.\nThe memos were made public by the American Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the three CIA-related documents under Freedom of Information Act requests.[204] They were among nearly 140,000 formerly classified documents from the Department of Defense, the Justice Department, and the CIA that provide details on the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody in the \"War on Terror\" gathered by the ACLU.[205]\nA less redacted version of the August 1, 2002, memo signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee (regarding Abu Zubaydah) and four memos from 2005 signed by Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury addressed to CIA and analysing the legality of various specific interrogation methods, including waterboarding, were released by Barack Obama's administration on April 16, 2009.[206]\nFollowing the release of the CIA documents, Philip Zelikow, a former State Department lawyer and adviser to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said that in 2005, he had written a legal memo objecting to torture. In it he argued that it was unlikely that \"any federal court would agree (that the approval of harsh interrogation techniques) ... was a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution.\" He claimed that the Bush Administration had ordered all copies of his legal memo be collected and destroyed.[207][208]\nSubsequent torture memoranda\n[edit]In May 2005, in response to requests from the CIA, Bradbury authored several memoranda that confirmed that several so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" did not constitute torture, including waterboarding,[209] walling, stress positions, striking a prisoner,[209][210][211] exposure to extreme temperatures,[211][212] dousing with cold water,[213] and forced sleep deprivation of up to 180 hours (7+1⁄2 days),[213][214][215][216][217][218] even when used in combination.[219][220] These memoranda found the CIA's practices to be lawful if applied in accordance with specified conditions, limitations, and safeguards, including those set forth in the agency's interrogation procedures.[210] Bradbury's memoranda were described by Democrats as an attempt to sidestep anti-torture laws and subvert a 2004 public Justice Department legal opinion characterizing torture as \"abhorrent\".[212] These memoranda were publicly released by the Obama Administration on April 16, 2009.\nBradbury authored an additional memo dated July 2007, seeking to reconcile the interrogation techniques with new developments, including intervening legislation such as the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the December 2005 Detainee Treatment Act. In response to this and other new legislation, the 2007 memo provided legal authorization and OLC approval for a more limited set of actions for use when interrogating high-value detainees. This approval encompassed six listed techniques, including temporary food deprivation of no less than 1,000 calories (4,200 kJ) per day, sleep deprivation by being forced to hold a \"standing position for as many as four days\", and several types of physical striking.[221][222]\nThe cumulative effect of Bush administration legal memos and exemption from prosecution had been to create a \"law free zone\" according to the former chief prosecutor at Guantánamo, where civilian politicians expected the military to use torture \"against our will and judgment\".[223]\nInternational legal bodies\n[edit]On May 19, 2006, the UN Committee against Torture issued a report stating the U.S. should stop secretly detaining, torturing, and ill-treating terror suspects, since such treatment is illegal under international law.[135][225]\nIn July 2014, the European Court of Human Rights condemned the government of Poland for participating in CIA extraordinary rendition to a black site in Poland for enhanced interrogation, which the court called \"torture, inhumane and degrading treatment\".[42] The court ordered the government of Poland to pay restitution to men who had been tortured there.[226]\nHuman rights organizations\n[edit]A report by Human Rights First (HRF) and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) stated that these techniques constitute torture.[133] Their press release said:\nThe report concludes that each of the ten tactics is likely to violate U.S. laws, including the War Crimes Act, the U.S. Torture Act, and the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.[133][227][228]\nThe Constitution Project convened a review of interrogation and detention programs in the years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It concluded in 2013 that \"it is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture\" and that the nation's highest officials bore ultimate responsibility for it.[229]\nBan on interrogation techniques\n[edit]On December 14, 2005, the Detainee Treatment Act was passed into law, setting the Army policy as standard for all agencies and prohibiting \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment\".[230]\nOn February 13, 2008, the U.S. Senate, in a 51 to 45 vote, approved a bill clarifying this language, allowing only \"those interrogation techniques explicitly authorized by the 2006 Army Field Manual.\"[231] The Washington Post stated:\nThe measure would effectively ban the use of simulated drowning, temperature extremes and other harsh tactics that the CIA used on al-Qaeda prisoners after the September 11, 2001, attacks.[232]\nPresident George W. Bush has said in a BBC interview he would veto such a bill[232][233] after previously signing an executive order that allows \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" and may exempt the CIA from Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.[231]\nOn March 8, 2008, President Bush vetoed this bill.\n\"Because the danger remains, we need to ensure our intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the terrorists\", Bush said in his weekly radio address. \"The bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror – the CIA program to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives.\" Bush said that the methods used by the military are designed for interrogating \"lawful combatants captured on the battlefield\", not the \"hardened terrorists\" normally questioned by the CIA. \"If we were to shut down this program and restrict the CIA to methods in the Field Manual, we could lose vital information from senior al Qaida terrorists, and that could cost American lives\", Bush said.\nMassachusetts senator Edward Kennedy described Bush's veto as \"one of the most shameful acts of his presidency\". He said, \"Unless Congress overrides the veto, it will go down in history as a flagrant insult to the rule of law and a serious stain on the good name of America in the eyes of the world.\"[234][235][236][237]\nAccording to Jane Mayer, during the transition period for then President-elect Barack Obama, his legal, intelligence, and national-security advisers had met at the CIA's headquarters in Langley to discuss \"whether a ban on brutal interrogation practices would hurt their ability to gather intelligence\", and among the consulted experts:\nThere was unanimity among Obama's expert advisers ... that to change the practices would not in any material way affect the collection of intelligence.[238]\nOn January 22, 2009, President Obama signed Executive Order 13491 requiring the CIA to use only the 19 interrogation methods outlined in the United States Army Field Manual on interrogations \"unless the Attorney General with appropriate consultation provides further guidance.\"[239]\nDecision not to prosecute\n[edit]Both U.S. and international law state that if a country is unwilling or unable to prosecute its own officials for torture, an international tribunal may do so.[240] For instance, under the principle of aut dedere aut judicare, parties to the United Nations Convention against Torture are obligated to either prosecute the accused parties, or extradite them to a state that will.[241]\nThe United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Torture, Human Rights Watch, and American legal scholars have called for the prosecution of Bush administration officials who ordered torture, conspired to provide legal cover for torture, and CIA and DoD personnel and contract workers who carried it out.[242] John Yoo, the former Bush administration attorney who authored the Torture Memos, has said that CIA officers risk prosecution for acts outside what the Justice Department specifically authorized.[18] A dozen lower-ranking Defense Department personnel were prosecuted for abuses at Abu Ghraib; one CIA contractor who beat Abdul Wali to death in Afghanistan was convicted of felony assault.[243]\nHowever, neither US domestic nor international prosecution of high-ranking officials is likely.[244]\nUS domestic prosecution refused\n[edit]President Obama, while condemning torture, ruled out prosecuting his Bush administration predecessors.[245][246] According to University of California Law School Dean Christopher Edley Jr., who served on President Obama's transition team, the decision not to prosecute predated Obama's taking office and was due to concern about a backlash by leaders of the military, the National Security Agency and the CIA.[247] In an interview, Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor under Obama, commented on the difficult political problems that torture prosecutions would have created, both in distracting from the administration's response to the Great Recession and potentially alienating the president from his own agencies.[248] Legal analysts such as Eric Posner and Andrew Napolitano have said that prosecutions would create a precedent putting Obama administration officials at risk of politically motivated prosecutions by their successors.[249]\nThe US Department of Justice announced that there will be no trials even of those who went well beyond what the Torture Memos allowed, including those who tortured detainees to death.[250] The rationale has not been disclosed. In response to a FOIA lawsuit, the Obama administration argued that the rationale should be kept secret because \"disclosing them could affect the candor of law enforcement deliberations about whether to bring criminal charges.\"[251]\nForeign prosecution\n[edit]There is no statute of limitations for war crimes in international law. However, prosecutions in either the International Criminal Court, or in the courts of a particular nation invoking the doctrine of universal jurisdiction, are also regarded as unlikely.[252]\nThe U.S. under the Bush administration \"unsigned\" the treaty that had conferred on the International Criminal Court jurisdiction over Americans.[253] In addition, President Bush signed the 2002 American Service-Members' Protection Act allowing military invasion of The Hague to rescue any Americans the court might detain for war crimes trials. Some torture occurred in CIA black site prisons in countries that remain parties to the treaty, like Poland, Afghanistan, Lithuania, and Romania. But for political reasons those countries are not in a position to initiate a prosecution, nor to extradite US officials to face charges.[252]\nInvoking the universal jurisdiction doctrine, the Center for Constitutional Rights tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former President George Bush, on behalf of four tortured detainees. Bush cancelled his trip to Switzerland after news of the potential warrant came to light.[254] Bush has traveled to Canada, but the Canadian government shut down the prosecution in advance of his arrest.[255] The Center filed a grievance with the United Nations for Canada's failure to enforce the Convention Against Torture, which was dismissed on December 2, 2015 on the grounds that it was inadmissible.[256]\nConsequence of failing to prosecute\n[edit]Without any prosecutions the possibility remains that a future presidential administration could claim torture is legal and revive its practice.[257] In February 2016, several leading U.S. presidential candidates openly argued for reintroducing torture,[258] including President Donald Trump who expressed his desire to bring back waterboarding.[259][260][261][262] The U.S. reluctance to punish torturers has set back the fight against torture worldwide, according to Juan E. Méndez, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture.[263]\nProsecution of John Kiriakou\n[edit]Former CIA officer John Kiriakou in 2007 was the first official within the U.S. government to confirm the use of waterboarding of al-Qaeda prisoners as an interrogation technique, which he described as torture.[264][265]\nOn October 22, 2012, Kiriakou pleaded guilty to disclosing classified information about a fellow CIA officer that connected the covert operative to a specific operation. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison on January 25, 2013.[266]\nEuropean Court of Human Rights decisions\n[edit]On July 24, 2014, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Poland violated the European Convention on Human Rights when it cooperated with the US, allowing the CIA to hold and torture Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri on its territory in 2002–2003. The court ordered the Polish government to pay each of the men 100,000 euros in damages. It also awarded Abu Zubaydah 30,000 euros to cover his costs.[267][268]\nOn May 31, 2018, the ECHR ruled that Romania and Lithuania also violated the rights of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in 2003–2005 and in 2005–2006 respectively, and Lithuania and Romania were ordered to pay 100,000 euros in damages each to Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Nashiri.[269]\nSee also\n[edit]- Bagram torture and prisoner abuse\n- Behavioral Science Consultation Team\n- Bush Six\n- CIA black sites\n- Black site\n- Command responsibility\n- Criticism of the War on Terror\n- Doublespeak\n- Extraordinary rendition\n- Five techniques\n- Gitmo playlist\n- High-Value Interrogation Group\n- Iraq prison abuse scandals\n- Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission\n- Law of war\n- Panetta Review\n- Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture\n- Torture and the United States\n- War crime\n- Subpoena ad testificandum\n- The Report (2019 film)\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"20 Extraordinary Facts about CIA Extraordinary Rendition and Secret Detention\". www.justiceinitiative.org.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

However, once the war on Iraq began, he urged decisive action to achieve a rapid US victory.\nDespite his anti-war stand on Iraq, the general has had a reputation for being belligerent. He was criticised during the Kosovo campaign for defending attacks on civilian Serbian targets, including the bombing of a television station that left about 20 journalists and other staff dead.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Twenty years after the United States invaded Iraq, there is no shortage of explanations for why this war took place. Political scientists and journalists dominated the early waves of scholarship on the subject, but in the last few years historians have increasingly intervened. This includes major new works published this year from Melvyn Leffler and Samuel Helfont.1 The invasion of Iraq remains the single most important foreign policy decision by a U.S. president in the 21st century, so the surfeit of analysis should surprise no one.\nThis article maps out the debate on the Iraq War’s origins as they have developed over the last 20 years. It aims to play honest broker between competing schools of thought, clearly laying out their interpretations, assessing points of tension, and factoring in the influences of politics and ideology on scholarship. Below, I will show how divergent interpretations of the war have emerged from the different lenses, methodologies, and objectives that scholars have brought to the table.\nNo single article can tackle every aspect of Iraq War scholarship. Thus, this essay focuses on three questions that are essential for explaining the war’s origins but that continue to divide scholars. First, was the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq driven more by the desire for security or the pursuit of primacy? Second, was the Bush administration’s decision to pursue “coercive diplomacy” in the fall and winter of 2002–2003 a genuine attempt to avoid war or a means to legitimize a decision for war made earlier in 2002? Third, how much did neoconservatives matter in the making of the Iraq War?\nThe first question — security vs. hegemony — constitutes the primary point of scholarly disagreement about the Iraq War. Security-focused explanations like those found in Leffler’s new book argue that the Bush administration’s primary motive was protecting the nation from future terrorist attacks in the transformed, post-9/11 environment in which threats like Iraq had to be re-evaluated.2 Scholars in the hegemony school like Ahsan Butt argue, in contrast, that the Bush administration used 9/11 and the threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction as a pretext to justify a war that was motivated primarily by the desire for regional and/or global hegemony.3 Other important questions flow from this security-hegemony divide, including the nature of Bush’s coercive diplomacy strategy and the role of neoconservatives in causing the war.\nUseful historiographical analysis begins with explaining why the scholarly landscape looks the way it does and then proposes directions for growth. The unavoidable challenge of interpreting history is all the more difficult in this case, because scholars have access to only a fraction of the primary documentation. As a result, much of the debate has boiled down to how to approach, critique, and contextualize the same small body of sources. In addition, political and policy debates have often had an outsized, if not always ideal, impact on the scholarship.4\nIn methodological terms, the security school has largely trusted that what policymakers say their motives were, both at the time and in hindsight, is what they actually were, unless clear contradictory evidence can be found. For this group, the critical context for understanding the war is the pressurized post-9/11 environment in which protecting the nation was everything and in which most parties saw Iraq as a significant threat.\nThe hegemony school retorts that key questions about the war do not make sense when viewed through a security prism. This group points out that scholars should not trust the testimonies of policymakers who have a strong incentive to deny the more ideological or delusional aspects of their actions. Instead, these scholars cast the Iraq War decision in wider historical contexts, identifying factors like the longstanding primacist policy views of figures like Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz that they believe have more explanatory relevance than security factors.\nAs might be expected with such a recent and contentious event, the Iraq War has not merely been a subject of scholarly analysis but an arena for rival political and policy views, especially when it comes to what lessons we can take away. Debates on the war’s origins have real-world stakes in terms of what the United States should learn from the war as it moves into an era of great-power competition. Security school scholars often view the Iraq War as an understandable mistake given the harrowing post-9/11 context and the fact that almost everyone believed Iraq was producing weapons of mass destruction at some level.5 They therefore rarely call for major revisions to post-Iraq U.S. foreign policy. The hegemony school, in stark contrast, argues that this war emerged from the ruinous bipartisan pursuit of global primacy and that similar disasters will occur if that grand strategy is not abandoned.\nA few caveats: This essay does not defend the existence of the security-hegemony divide nor take sides in this debate. Instead, it seeks to explain its parameters, evolution, and stakes. Some may object to this depiction of two broad interpretive camps as oversimplifying a vast body of nuanced scholarship. To address this problem, this article tries to identify possible means of synthesizing these interpretations. The security and hegemony camps do overlap in some ways, as discussed below, but this divide also reflects that scholars themselves have identified genuine differences about what set of factors drove the causal boat. Finally, this essay concludes with a plea for more global and cultural analysis of the Iraq War as a way to challenge this binary.\nNevertheless, there is value in “lumping” in historiographical analysis, which is particularly useful for newcomers to the field or non-specialists who want a bird’s-eye view of the existing scholarship. This broad approach also helps to identify the essential questions that continue to divide and drive the field, questions that future work on the Iraq War should tackle.\nConsequently, this essay does not exhaust the totality of scholarship of the Iraq War, nor does it offer its own historical or theoretical explanation of the war’s causes. Both tasks would occupy far too much space. Thus, certain topics on which there is outstanding work receive less attention, including the beliefs and decisions of the Baathist regime, the history of weapons inspectors prior to 2002–2003, problems with pre-war planning, and the international diplomacy that preceded the war’s onset. These questions are important for fully understanding the war’s origins, but they have not formed the primary lines of scholarly disagreement, which are the focal points of this essay.6\nSecurity vs. Hegemony: The Core Divide\nDid the United States invade Iraq in a misguided effort to remove a security threat in the unprecedentedly heated post-9/11 atmosphere? Or did U.S. leaders use 9/11 as a pretext to pursue an opportunistic war that was really about American hegemony?\nThe obvious answer might be “a little of both,” or that this is a false dichotomy. The United States, for example, could have pursued security through a hegemonic grand strategy that might have involved regime change in nations like Iraq. Iraq could have been seen as both a real security threat and an obstacle to U.S. primacy.7\nNonetheless, this core divide among scholars is real, reflecting meaningful differences in interpretation, contextualization, and even politics. The scholars themselves frequently identify security- or hegemony-based factors as the most salient. Security-focused explanations maintain that, in the post-9/11 atmosphere, hegemonic aspirations were secondary to security imperatives. Hegemony-focused explanations rarely dismiss security altogether, but they contend that concerns about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and terrorist ties served as pretexts for deep-seated hegemonic designs. Each school casts the war in different contexts, with the security school emphasizing the post-9/11 moment and the hegemony school stressing the preceding decades in which the architects of the war developed their policy worldviews.\nThe Security School\nLeffler is the dean of the security school, which also includes Robert Jervis, Frederic Bozo, Alexander Debs, Ivo Daalder, James Lindsay, Peter Hahn, Hakan Tunc, and Steve Yetiv. While these scholars do not ignore larger U.S. goals and ideologies, they argue that the Bush administration’s pursuit of security in the aftermath of 9/11 was the primary cause of the decision to invade. Bush, Leffler writes, “went to war not out of a fanciful idea to make Iraq democratic, but to rid it of its deadly weapons, its links to terrorists, and its ruthless, unpredictable tyrant.”8 Jervis does not dismiss democracy as a secondary motive, but he claims that “[t]he fundamental cause of the invasion was the perception of unacceptable threat from Saddam [Hussein] triggered by the combination of pre-existing beliefs about his regime and the impact of terrorist attacks.”9 Bozo concludes that “the choice for war clearly arose first and foremost from a logic of national security.”10\nSecurity school arguments emphasize the transformative impact of 9/11 on U.S. national security as essential for understanding the Iraq War. Leffler and Jervis argue that, while the Bush administration entered office with several prominent regime-change proponents in high-ranking positions, it did not obsess over Iraq in its first nine months nor make meaningful moves toward toppling Saddam Hussein. Bush also came into office opposing nation-building and promising strategic restraint.11\n“But scholars in the security school agree that the weapons of mass destruction-terrorism-rogue state security threat was no mere pretext but rather the driving motive for the war.”\nThe 9/11 attacks, however, revolutionized U.S. foreign policy and set the stage for the Iraq War. The Bush administration felt extraordinary anger, fear, and vulnerability after 9/11, which prompted it to rethink other security threats.12 Leffler argues that, for the Bush team, “the risk calculus had changed dramatically after 9/11.”13 They could no longer tolerate states that pursued weapons of mass destruction, threatened their neighbors and/or the United States, and supported terrorism.\nWhy, then, invade Iraq in particular? The Bush administration viewed Iraq as the “nexus” of these threats.14 As Bush himself argued, Iraq checked the following boxes more than any other state: “state sponsors of terror … sworn enemies of America … hostile governments that threatened their neighbors … regimes that pursued WMD [weapons of mass destruction].”15 Top officials may have made major mistakes and exaggerated regarding Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and terrorist ties, but they did not hoodwink the people. Rather, they truly believed these threats were real and growing. Moreover, few analysts at the time, even from nations that opposed the war, accurately assessed the truth that Saddam was not engaged in meaningful production of weapons of mass destruction. Saddam also obstructed inspectors for nearly a decade, creating the reasonable impression that he aimed to resume production of such weapons.16\nThe United States could not wait for the Iraqi threat to fully emerge given the risk of “the smoking gun coming in the form of a mushroom cloud,” as National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice famously stated.17 So, it declared a right to launch preventive wars to remove the threat. This presumed right formed the core of the Bush Doctrine, which, for the security school, was less a blueprint for primacy than an adaptation of longstanding ideas about the use of force in the face of a new threat.18\nFor the security school, the Iraq War did not stem primarily from grand schemes of extending U.S. hegemony or liberal values. Overwhelming U.S. military power and the unipolarity of the international system made regime change possible, but the war was not motivated primarily by these factors. Leffler asserts that “missionary fervor or idealistic impulses” played little role in the Bush team’s decisions.19 Tunc contends that hegemony makes little sense as a motive for the Iraq War, as eliminating this relatively minor rival would not have changed the global balance of power.20\nIdealistic dreams and the global imbalance of power, after all, had existed for at least a decade when 9/11 happened. The attack was the decisive new variable that prompted a reevaluation of national security, which ultimately led to the invasion. Leffler summarizes the fundamental, security-centric causes: “They were seeking to safeguard the country from another attack, save American lives, avoid the opprobrium that would come from another assault, and preserve the country’s ability to exercise its power in the future on behalf of its interests.”21\nSecurity school scholars often take a more sympathetic view of the Bush administration’s Iraq policy. Leffler stresses the emotional trauma of 9/11, including top officials’ visits to Ground Zero and meetings with first responders and the bereaved. Context is vital to this interpretation, as he argues: “Critics forget how ominous the al Qaeda threat seemed and how evil and manipulative Hussein really was.”22 He maintains that the Bush team sought to “do the right thing” and protect the nation from what they believed was an imminent threat.23 But scholars in the security school agree that the weapons of mass destruction-terrorism-rogue state security threat was no mere pretext but rather the driving motive for the war. As Jervis argues, given the consensus about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and the post-9/11 need to rethink security threats, “There is little reason to doubt that Bush and his colleagues sincerely believed that Saddam had active WMD [weapons of mass destruction] programs.”24\nThe security school overlaps considerably with Bush officials’ memoirs, which also emphasize security motives for war.25 These memoirs depict the emotional weight of the post-9/11 moment, in which the administration felt responsibility for not stopping 9/11 and dreaded the next attack. “I could not have forgiven myself had there been another attack,” recalls Rice.26 Bush writes that “before 9/11, Saddam was a problem America might have been able to manage.” However, “through the lens of the post-9/11 world, my view changed.”27 Protecting the nation from further terrorist attacks became the overriding priority, and threats like Iraq could no longer be tolerated.28 Official memoirs emphasize that the administration did not want war with Iraq and sought ways to avoid it, but ultimately national security concerns required removing this menace.29\nThis overlap makes sense given the reliance of scholars like Leffler on interviews with administration insiders. However, it also raises concerns that the security school may be accepting policymakers’ portrayals of events at face value. Bush officials have an obvious interest in saying that they remained open to non-violent solutions to the Iraq problem or that they were not idealistic crusaders.30 As we will see, the hegemony school takes a more adversarial approach to this question.\nThe Hegemony School\nScholars in the hegemony school include Butt, Stephen Walt, Andrew Bacevich, Patrick Porter, Paul Pillar, G. John Ikenberry, David Harvey, John Mearsheimer, and Jeffrey Record. They tend toward the realist school of international relations, but not exclusively. They acknowledge the role of security concerns in motivating the Iraq War, but they view security rationales as radically incomplete explanations. Their core claim is that the primary motivation of the invasion was maintaining and expanding U.S. hegemony. The hegemony school splits, however, on whether the United States sought realist or liberal forms of hegemony.\nOn the side of realist hegemony, Butt argues that the war stemmed from the “desire to maintain the United States’ global standing and hierarchic order,” with security acting more as a pretext for domestic consumption than a causal factor.31 9/11 threatened U.S. hegemony, leading the United States to opt for a “performative war” that would re-establish “generalized deterrence,” or the reputation for unassailable power and the willingness to use it that undergirded hegemony.32 He quotes Rumsfeld saying on 9/11 that “[w]e need to bomb something else [other than Afghanistan] to prove that we’re, you know, big and strong and not going to be pushed around by these kinds of attacks.”33 Butt contends that nothing in the available intelligence about Iraq suggested that it was an imminent threat. It was, however, a convenient foe for demonstrating U.S. power, as it had not yet constructed any weapons of mass destruction, remained weak militarily and isolated diplomatically, and was detested by the U.S. public.34\n“Scholars in the realist-hegemony camp see the Iraq War as a means to maintain realist priorities like unipolarity and U.S. freedom of action in the world.”\nStephen Wertheim agrees, arguing that “the decision to invade Iraq stemmed from the pursuit of global primacy,” the goal of which is to “dissuade other countries from rising and challenging American dominance.”35 Ikenberry and Daniel Deudney concur: “The primary objective of the war was the preservation and extension of American primacy in a region with high importance to American national interests.”36 Record likewise contends that “the invasion was a conscious expression of America’s unchecked global military hegemony that was designed to perpetuate that hegemony by intimidating those who would challenge it.”37\nScholars in the realist-hegemony camp see the Iraq War as a means to maintain realist priorities like unipolarity and U.S. freedom of action in the world. The Bush administration seized 9/11 and the ostensible Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction threat as a “pretext,” “opportunity,” or “rationale” to extend this agenda, which they believed would destroy the terrorist threat and other challenges to U.S. power.38 Democratization was a secondary motive to justify a war that was grounded in the pursuit of power.39\nWalt, Porter, and Bacevich agree that the United States sought to demonstrate its power and preserve hegemony by invading Iraq, but they contend that the Bush administration aimed specifically to solidify liberal hegemony. Under this grand strategy, the United States sought to spread liberal democracy and capitalism, which were not only good in themselves but were ways to maintain global predominance.40 The Cold War had restrained this strategy, but the Soviet collapse allowed the United States to pursue it with reckless idealism and hubris. The bipartisan foreign policy establishment came to assume the universality of liberal ideals and a presumed U.S. right to intervene anywhere in the world, either to protect human rights or suppress challenges to American power.41\nWhen attacked on 9/11, according to this narrative, the United States did not examine whether liberal hegemony was generating resistance. Instead, the Bush administration, with bipartisan backing, escalated the pursuit of liberal hegemony and asserted a unilateral right to change the regimes of rival states through preventive war, also known as the Bush Doctrine. Security school scholars see this doctrine as a response to a new category of threat. The hegemony school, however, views it as a blueprint for preserving U.S. primacy that asserted the unilateral American right to destroy potential threats like Iraq and stated a desire to prevent the rise of peer competitors.42 Some scholars also emphasize the importance of protecting Israel and advancing U.S. oil interests as additional hegemonic motives for this war, although these remain controversial explanations.43\nFor Walt, Porter, and others, the Iraq War emerged from the pursuit of liberal hegemony, a revisionist grand strategy that sought to spread democracy and other liberal values, topple tyrants, and thereby build a more peaceful and cooperative world order. Following this vision, the United States wanted not only to remove a threat but to revolutionize Middle Eastern politics by implanting democracy in Iraq.44 They cite considerable evidence that democracy promotion was an important motive for the war, particularly for Bush, rather than a mere justification for a war based in power.45 The 2002 National Security Strategy, for example, reflected this universalistic idealism in declaring, “The great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom — and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, democracy, and free enterprise.”46\nThis war fit the longstanding and essentially liberal belief of many U.S. policymakers that autocracies represent an inherent threat to long-term peace, prosperity, and security and that only a democratic international order can assure these goods.47 As Bush argued in a February 2003 speech, “The world has a clear interest in the spread of democratic values because stable and free nations do not breed the ideologies of murder.”48 Liberal idealism, as Michael MacDonald argues, also convinced the Bush administration that regime change in Iraq would be easy, because the Iraqis would quickly adopt the default of democracy after the removal of the Baathists.49\nMearsheimer calls the Iraq War “probably the best example of this kind of liberal interventionism” that dominated post-Cold War U.S. thinking.50 Bacevich argues that the weapons of mass destruction threat was a “cover story” and that the war’s main objectives were to “force the Middle East into the U.S.-dominated liberal order of capitalist democracies and assert its prerogative of removing regimes that opposed U.S. interests.”51 As Porter contends, “The Iraq War … was an effort to reorder the world. Its makers aimed to spread capitalist democracy on their terms.”52\nTo some extent, this divide within the hegemony camp reflects the different worldviews of the top decision-makers in the Bush administration. Rumsfeld and Cheney fit a more realist paradigm, focusing on reasserting power more than spreading democracy. Others, like Wolfowitz, viewed the Iraq War as part of the liberal project. Bush embodied a mix of these perspectives.53\nDifferences over whether the United States sought to achieve realist or liberal hegemony should not obscure fundamental commonalities of the hegemony school. These scholars concur that the United States had been pursuing some form of primacy well before 9/11, that 9/11 both threatened that primacy and provided a pretext or opportunity to reassert it, and that Iraq was less a threat than a convenient target for solidifying hegemony.\nIn terms of contextualization, the pre-9/11 era is more important for the hegemony school than the security school, as the former stress continuities in U.S. foreign policy stretching back into the Cold War.54 These scholars emphasize that key architects of the war like Rumsfeld, Cheney, and Wolfowitz had openly supported U.S. hegemony in the decades preceding 9/11. Many cite the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, which was written by Zalmay Khalilzad and Abram Shulsky under the oversight of Wolfowitz, then serving under Cheney.55 This document endorsed a hegemonic grand strategy that would maintain indefinite global military dominance and seek to “prevent the re-emergence of a new rival.”56 Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, and a host of other future Bush administration officials also signed open letters in the late 1990s calling for regime change in Iraq and a primacist grand strategy.57\nFollowing 9/11, these hegemonists immediately linked the Baathist regime to the terrorism problem in spite of a dearth of evidence, pushed dubious intelligence, hyped the Iraqi threat, and downplayed the risks of invasion. For the hegemony school, this is evidence that the administration “wanted war,” to paraphrase Record’s book, and that its later claims that it went to war regretfully are self-serving myths.58\nSome Bush administration officials have bucked the official security-focused explanation and acknowledged the importance of larger ideological or hegemonic designs. CIA Director George Tenet wrote in his memoir that top administration members seemed uninterested in figuring out the details of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs. He interpreted this to mean that they decided to invade Iraq using such weapons as a pretext. He held that “The United States did not go to war in Iraq solely because of WMD [weapons of mass destruction]. In my view, I doubt it was even the principal cause. Yet it was the public face put on it.” As real reasons, he pointed to “larger geostrategic calculations, ideology,” and “democratic transformation.”59 White House Press Secretary Scott McLellan similarly concluded that “removing the ‘grave and gathering danger’ Iraq supposedly posed was primarily a means for achieving the far more grandiose objective of reshaping the Middle East as a region of peaceful democracies.”60\nSynthesizing the Security and Hegemony Schools\nWhy can’t the hegemony and security schools just get along? Some scholars have tried to synthesize these approaches. Michael Mazarr, Robert Draper, and Justin Vaisse’s works examine the national security urgency of the post-9/11 moment without ignoring the historical context of U.S. hegemony and idealism.61 In my own attempts at synthesis, I have contended that during the 1990s a bipartisan “regime change consensus” formed on Iraq that predisposed the U.S. foreign policy establishment to support Saddam’s ouster and to view containment as a failing alternative policy. Broad agreement about U.S. hegemony fed this consensus and made the Iraq War seem logical to many U.S. elites. Nevertheless, 9/11 was a critical variable that drastically decreased America’s willingness to tolerate threats like Iraq while providing more leeway to U.S. leaders to pursue risky strategies.62\nOne way of synthesizing these schools is to create a division of causal labor, wherein the hegemony school helps explain “Why Iraq?” and the security school addresses “Why now?” Hegemony school analysts often ask: If the United States was really concerned about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, why not focus on countries with more advanced programs, like North Korea? If the United States was really concerned about terrorism, why not focus on more active state sponsors, like Iran?\n“After all, as Pillar and others argue, the Bush administration used the intelligence process not in a good-faith effort to accurately assess Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction but to gather — if not inflate — evidence to support the case for regime change.”\nThese inconsistencies having to do with “Why Iraq?” expose a key problem for security-based explanations: Iraq, which became the central front of the War on Terror, was neither the most powerful “rogue state,” nor was it involved in 9/11. Instead, in the hegemonic framework, Iraq was an opportunity more than a threat, and its putative weapons of mass destruction programs were a pretext more than a motive. As former CIA intelligence analyst Paul Pillar starkly puts it, concern about such weapons “was not the principal or even a major reason the Bush administration went to war.” It was “at most a subsidiary motivator of the policy.”63 After all, as Pillar and others argue, the Bush administration used the intelligence process not in a good-faith effort to accurately assess Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction but to gather — if not inflate — evidence to support the case for regime change.64\nHowever, the hegemony school struggles to answer the “Why now?” question. If the bipartisan pursuit of hegemony and liberal idealism are constants in U.S. foreign policy, then why did the Iraq War not happen sooner, possibly after inspectors left Iraq in 1998? By focusing on how 9/11 reshaped U.S. foreign policy and threat perception, the security school gets at a fundamental point that few analysts contest: A U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq is virtually inconceivable without 9/11.\nOne interesting point of agreement between the security and hegemony schools is that the end of the Cold War constitutes an essential precondition for the Iraq War. The idea of the United States in the midst of the Cold War invading a mid-sized country — once a Soviet satellite — to change its regime seems far fetched. The hegemony school particularly emphasizes the importance of unipolarity, which it believes allowed dreams of hegemony, realist or liberal, to run wild in the U.S. imagination.65 This leads one to speculate as to whether the return of multipolarity will deter the United States from further attempts at direct regime change.\nThe relationship between the 1990–1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War remains an under-studied aspect of this field. Scholars like Helfont, Christian Alfonsi, and myself have argued that the Gulf War’s messy ending initiated a pattern of conflict between the United States and Iraq that festered throughout the 1990s, creating a strong desire in the U.S. political establishment to finish the job, even before 9/11.66 There was, after all, no war with Iran or North Korea in the 1990s, nor was there an Iran or North Korean Liberation Act. There was, however, the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act, which declared regime change as the official U.S. policy toward Iraq.67 Relatively few works, however, systematically trace U.S.-Iraqi relations through this period, although Helfont’s recent book significantly rectifies this by tracing Iraq’s challenge to the post-Cold War, U.S.-led international order through the 1990s.68\nDespite attempts at synthesis, there is a meaningful tension between the security and hegemony schools that makes any kind of reconciliation difficult. It is hard to interpret a war as both predetermined and contingent — harder still to view the Bush administration as obsessed with regime change and open to many ways of disarming Iraq. Moreover, as this section demonstrates, there is primary source evidence to support both major interpretations.\nThe security and hegemony schools’ points of contrast also matter for how the war is interpreted as a whole. Was it an understandable tragedy or an unforced and unforgivable blunder?69 In terms of periodization, was the war essentially rooted in a response to 9/11, or do its roots stretch back decades in U.S. foreign policy? Finally, does the Iraq War, especially the controversial Bush Doctrine, represent a sharp change in U.S. diplomatic history or continuity with previous trends, goals, and ideas?70\nWhat Was “Coercive Diplomacy” All About?\nWhatever side scholars favor in the security-hegemony debate shades how they understand other key questions about the war’s origins. This essay tackles two additional issues that have divided scholars, starting with the question of why Bush attempted a “coercive diplomacy” strategy in late 2002 and early 2003.\nIn the fall of 2002, under pressure from British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Secretary of State Colin Powell, Bush decided to take the “diplomatic track” on Iraq. On Sept. 12, at the United Nations, he called for Iraq to readmit weapons inspections or face being overthrown. He also sought a congressional authorization to use force against Iraq.71 At the same time, the build-up of U.S. troops in the region put the credible threat of force behind this final attempt at diplomacy. Rice describes this strategy as “coercive diplomacy.”72\nBut what was the purpose of coercive diplomacy? Was it a genuine attempt to peacefully disarm Iraq? Or was it a way of gaining legitimacy and allied and domestic political support for a predetermined policy of regime change? This debate matters for establishing when the Bush administration made the decision for war and the extent to which it was simply hell bent on regime change, no matter the circumstances. The security-hegemony debate is important but somewhat deterministic. The coercive diplomacy debate incorporates questions about the contingency of the war as well as possible off-ramps.\nLeffler writes that, in early 2002, Bush was “not yet ready to choose between containment and regime change,” and he remained undecided into the fall of 2002.73 Bush was torn as to whether disarmament could be achieved without regime change. Coercive diplomacy was a final attempt to find this out. When he adopted this strategy, he accepted that it might mean that war would not occur and that Saddam might remain in power for the time being. He also rejected, for the moment, the advice of more hawkish advisors like Cheney and Rumsfeld that working through the United Nations would be counter-productive.74 As Leffler writes, Bush “decided to see if he could accomplish his key objectives … without war.”75 In this narrative, Bush did not decide to invade until January 2003, after Iraqi authorities had failed to fully comply with a new round of weapons inspections.76\nOther scholars, especially those in the security school, agree with Leffler’s view of coercive diplomacy. Frank Harvey claims that coercive diplomacy sought “to re-invigorate a failing containment policy by reinforcing multilateral, U.N. inspections that demanded full and complete compliance.”77 Debs and Nuno Monteiro also agree that in supporting new inspections the Bush administration genuinely sought to test Iraqi cooperation and avoid war.78\nThese analyses stress the contingency of Bush’s approach to Iraq. Some Bush officials may have been impassioned advocates of regime change, but Bush nonetheless proceeded deliberately and gave peaceful methods of disarmament a final chance. He did so because he prioritized disarmament by whatever means, not regime change for ulterior reasons.\nAgain, this account matches U.S. leaders’ descriptions of their own actions. Bush states in his memoir, “My first choice was to use diplomacy” on Iraq.79 Coercive diplomacy was an earnest attempt to avoid war, but Saddam’s failure to comply with inspections compelled Bush to choose war in early 2003.80 Rice similarly claimed, “We invaded Iraq because we believed we had run out of other options.”81\n“For scholars like Leffler, the situation remained fluid and contingent until just months before the invasion. For scholars like Mazarr, the war was virtually inevitable once the Bush administration set its sights on Iraq in early 2002.”\nMichael Mazarr and others challenge Leffler’s account of coercive diplomacy and locate the decision to invade well before early 2003. Mazarr writes that “between September 11 and December 2001 … the Bush administration — while nowhere near what would be defined as the formal ‘decision’ to go to war — had irrevocably committed itself to the downfall of Saddam Hussein.”82 War planning began in November 2002, and Bush made several private and public comments before spring 2002 that he intended to remove Saddam.83\nThat fall, Bush sided with Powell in choosing the diplomatic track, but even Powell never challenged the wisdom of invading Iraq.84 There was almost no debate in his administration about whether invading Iraq was a sound idea, suggesting that the decision had been made even before the coercive diplomacy effort began.85 Mazarr adds that a “tidal wave of evidence can be found that many senior officials assumed war was inevitable long before September 2002.”86 The Bush administration quickly judged that the inspections had failed in early 2003 and cemented the decision to invade in January.87\nMy own research concurs with Mazarr and further adds that the idea that Bush sought to restore containment through coercive diplomacy makes little sense. Bush had already made the case earlier in 2002 that containment could not handle the “nexus” threat. Moreover, most of his advisers and the policy establishment already viewed containment as a dead letter. Finally, the Bush administration was exceedingly doubtful of the efficacy of inspections, and it set such a high bar for their success as to virtually predetermine failure.88\nScholars in the hegemony school generally agree with Mazarr’s analysis of coercive diplomacy. They hold that the Bush administration was uninterested in peacefully resolving this crisis because it was looking for an opportunity to assert U.S. power. They therefore view coercive diplomacy as a charade to legitimize a predetermined war. Butt, for example, argues that Iraq could not have done anything to avoid war, because the United States had decided to crush a rival to re-establish generalized deterrence.89 John Prados contends that Bush made the decision for war in the early spring of 2002, and Richard Haass locates that decision in July 2002, all before coercive diplomacy began.90\nAs with the core security-hegemony divide, the debate about coercive diplomacy resists resolution. For scholars like Leffler, the situation remained fluid and contingent until just months before the invasion. For scholars like Mazarr, the war was virtually inevitable once the Bush administration set its sights on Iraq in early 2002. A possible synthesis may be that the administration’s intense pessimism about the possibility that Saddam would give in to U.S. threats and comply with inspections constituted a de facto decision for war, if not an absolutely final determination.91 If anything, coercive diplomacy might be another under-examined aspect of the Iraq War, skipped over by numerous analyses that assign the war’s origins to security or hegemony.92 Doing so leads to overly deterministic explanations of the war that leave little room for contingency.\nOne way this impasse might be addressed is through more analysis of the State Department’s role in the lead-up to war. Powell and his deputy Richard Armitage supported the war but were not true believers, and many skeptics of the war filled the State Department’s higher ranks.93 When more sources become available, it will be interesting to see whether Powell or anyone else asked any critical questions about the fundamental decision to go to war or pressed Bush to pursue coercive diplomacy thoroughly. This would show whether there really was uncertainty in the administration and openness to non-violent solutions, as Leffler claims, or whether the United States was on an unalterable path to war before the fall of 2002, as Mazarr argues.94\nScholars should be careful, however, of thinking that new documentary evidence will fully resolve these disagreements. The British Iraq Inquiry, published in 2016, released a flood of primary sources and interviews on British policymaking on Iraq from 2001 to 2009.95 Numerous scholars have drawn on this fascinating material, but interpretive tensions remain because they look at this evidence through different lenses. For example, Leffler argues that Blair’s correspondence with Bush after 9/11 demonstrates that neither party was rushing to war with Iraq but merely establishing a general timeframe for pressuring the Iraqi regime to disarm.96 This supports his larger argument that the Bush administration was not obsessed with war, attempted other means of disarming Iraq, and only decided on war after the exhaustion of other options.\nButt, in contrast, argues that these same sources demonstrate that “war was decided upon very soon after — probably even on-9/11.” Blair, after all, told Bush on Oct. 11, 2001, that “I have no doubt we need to deal with Saddam” and that “we can devise a strategy for Saddam deliverable at a later date.”97 For Butt, this source shows that Bush and Blair agreed on the goal of regime change in Iraq and the reassertion of U.S. hegemony in the Middle East almost immediately after 9/11. Blair merely cautioned Bush not to rush into war without building a coalition.98 Porter, author of a book on Britain’s war in Iraq, also draws heavily on the Iraq Inquiry and arrives at a similar conclusion. He contends that the Blair government was as ideologically committed to strategic primacy and the spread of liberal democracy as Bush. It never seriously considered alternatives but “worried predominantly about how to create conditions that would legitimize a British military campaign, that would generate enough support.”99\nThe discrepancies between scholars using the same documents demonstrate the importance of the interpretative frameworks that analysts bring to their sources. As a result, new sources will not necessarily lead to convergence between interpretive camps.\nHow Important Were the Neocons?\nThe last major question this essay tackles about the Iraq War’s origins is the role of neoconservatives. Were they the intellectual architects of this war or extraneous to the decision to invade? While the alignment here is imperfect, the security school tends to downplay neoconservatives while the hegemony school usually argues for their central importance.\nNeoconservatives are a loose intellectual movement that has evolved considerably since its origins in the 1960s. Vaisse defines third-wave neoconservatism as a nationalistic movement that peaked in the 1990s and early 2000s. It sought to promote U.S. primacy, “national greatness,” and the spreading of democracy, all with a unilateralist bent.100 A significant number of neoconservatives worked in high positions in the Bush administration, most notably Wolfowitz.101\nWhile neoconservative intellectuals like Robert Kagan and William Kristol clearly advocated for regime change in public discourse, debate about the role of neoconservatives in bringing about the Iraq War has been contentious. Much early commentary crudely suggested that a “cabal” of neoconservatives hijacked U.S. foreign policy and drove the nation into a disastrous war. For instance, then-Sen. Joe Biden, who voted to authorize the Iraq War but later regretted this decision, said in July 2003, “They seem to have captured the heart and mind of the President, and they’re controlling the foreign policy agenda.” Frank Harvey convincingly argues that these narratives are not only simplistic but provide cover for the many political groups who supported what became an unpopular war.102\nHarvey, Leffler, and others argue that neoconservatives were either irrelevant or of secondary importance in causing the Iraq War. Harvey takes an extreme position here, arguing that they were totally extraneous and, in fact, lost most of the debates on Iraq before the invasion.103 Leffler and Mazarr argue that, although there were neoconservatives in the Bush administration, neither Bush nor the top echelon of decision-makers were neoconservatives.104 Leffler downplays the role of neoconservatism or any other ideology in the administration’s decision-making, focusing instead on security motives.105\n“Without these ideas, Flibbert concludes, invading Iraq would not have made sense, making the actions of neoconservatives essential to explaining the war.”\nDaalder and Lindsay argue that Bush and most of his top advisers were “assertive nationalists,” or “traditional hard-line conservatives willing to use American military power to defeat threats to U.S. security but reluctant as a general rule to use American primacy to remake the world in its image.”106 Jane Cramer and Edward Duggan contend that Bush, Rumsfeld, and Cheney, the three most important decision-makers in the administration, were not neoconservatives but “primacists” and consistent hard-liners who had never shown concern for democratization or human rights in their long careers.107 In his history of Bush’s war cabinet, journalist James Mann contends that Bush relied mainly on the “Vulcans” — like Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Armitage, and Dov Zakheim — for foreign policy guidance, few of whom were neoconservatives. Rather, these Vulcans “were focused above all on American military power” and maintaining U.S. primacy, especially after the Vietnam debacle.108\nThese authors agree that neoconservatives like Wolfowitz may have pushed for regime change, but their presence in the administration was not vital for making this war happen.109 Mazarr also minimizes the role of neoconservatives — but not ideology in general. He contends that “many aspects of the neocons’ foreign policy assumptions reflected the prevailing conventional wisdom in the U.S. national security community,” including primacy, exceptionalism, and the universality of democracy.110\nSome scholars in the realist hegemony school agree with this analysis. Butt dismisses the role of neoconservatives, arguing that they provided an ideological gloss for a war that was really about power.111 Oddly enough, some neoconservatives concur with the minimization of their own roles. Kagan, for instance, contends that security concerns drove decision-making and that the war “can be understood without reference to a neoconservative doctrine.”112\nMany scholars, especially in the liberal hegemony school, argue instead that neoconservatives played an essential role in causing the Iraq War. For them, neoconservatism helps to address a key question: Why, after 9/11, did the United States invade a country that had not attacked it?\nAs Andrew Flibbert argues, neoconservative policy entrepreneurship closed the conceptual gap between Iraq and terrorism. Figures like Wolfowitz, Doug Feith, and Scooter Libby interpreted 9/11 through a “larger ideational framework” about America’s role in the world and acted as policy activists inside the administration and in the public discourse. They helped to set the post-9/11 agenda with a focus on Iraq, at a time when figures like Rice and Powell seemed skeptical of such a focus. They advanced a host of arguments for war: the nexus threat, Saddam’s brutality, protecting U.S. interests in the region, advancing democracy, transforming the Middle East, asserting U.S. power, and even improving Israeli-Palestinian relations. Without these ideas, Flibbert concludes, invading Iraq would not have made sense, making the actions of neoconservatives essential to explaining the war.113\nThe hegemony school naturally focuses on the role of neoconservatives in constructing a liberal hegemonic war. Pillar argues that “[t]he chief purpose of forcibly removing Saddam flowed from the central objectives of neoconservatism,” the core of which is “the proposition that the United States should use its power and influence to spread its freedom-oriented values.”114 Walt and Mearsheimer concur: “The driving force behind the Iraq War was a small band of neoconservatives who had long favored the energetic use of American power to reshape critical areas of the world.”115 Gary Dorrien notes that this band was in fact quite large: Over 20 neoconservatives held high-ranking positions in the Bush administration, forming an activist core for pushing war with Iraq.116\nVaisse adds that in 2003 Cheney ordered 30 copies of the neoconservative Weekly Standard to the White House every week.117 He notes that, while Bush may have campaigned as a restraint-minded realist, he and Rice essentially adopted a neoconservative worldview after 9/11, speaking often of a U.S. obligation to topple tyrants and spread liberal values.118 Other analysts show how neoconservatives led the way in promoting damning, if dubious, information about Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction programs and links to al-Qaeda that would help sell the war.119\nJournalistic accounts of the Iraq War also tend to stress the role of neoconservative networks and personalities in clearing the path to war. They effectively demonstrate the close personal contacts of neoconservative intellectuals and Iraqi exiles like Ahmad Chalabi with top Bush administration officials. While they sometimes do not make systematic arguments about the war, they certainly show that neoconservative influence was swirling around the administration and the foreign policy establishment at the time.120\nThe neoconservative issue is germane to larger questions about the Iraq War and recent U.S. foreign policy. Was ideology a fundamental motivator of the decision to invade or a justification that was developed to sell the war? Is the way to restore balance and restraint to U.S. foreign policy after Iraq simply to purge neoconservatives, or is more profound change needed? Are neoconservatives simply a new expression of America’s exceptionalist identity and missionary impulses dating back centuries, or are they a discrete and modern ideological movement?121 These are crucial issues for locating the Iraq War in the larger history of ideas and intellectuals in U.S. diplomatic history.\nIraq War Scholarship and U.S. Foreign Policy\nThe Iraq War’s long and costly nature has shaped discussions about what lessons it holds for U.S. foreign policy, but the competing interpretations of the war’s origins are also relevant for these debates. The majority of scholars in the security and hegemony schools agree that Iraq was a mistake, if not something worse. But they disagree on its consequences for U.S. foreign policy.\nSecurity-centric explanations of the war lend themselves to a less condemning portrayal of the Bush administration and the foreign policy establishment. Hal Brands and Peter Feaver refer to an “empathy defense,” arguing that “greater sensitivity to constraints, alternatives, and context can lead to a more favorable view of decisions taken in Afghanistan and Iraq following 9/11.” In this reading, Bush faced an unprecedented security threat after 9/11 and launched a mistaken war riddled with errors in intelligence, planning, and execution.122\nThose errors, however, do not mean that the United States needs to drastically rethink its position of global leadership.123 Many conservatives, neoconservatives, and liberal internationalists have concluded that the lesson of Iraq is not to abandon an active and engaged global posture, but rather to eschew ambitious nation-building and democratization projects.124 Brands argues that “the Iraq hangover” should not make U.S. leaders “strategically sluggish just as the dangers posed by great power rivals were growing.”125 America’s defense of the liberal international order, they contend, has been overwhelmingly positive for U.S. interests as well as global democracy, prosperity, and peace.126 The United States can continue to play this role while avoiding obvious mistakes like the Iraq invasion.127 Nor does this war mean that the foreign policy establishment must be overthrown.128\n“Still, this article suggests that even as the United States refocuses toward great-power competition, the meanings and lessons of the Iraq War remain hotly contested and highly consequential for America’s global role.”\nU.S. leaders seem to agree with this view of the lessons of Iraq, including those like President Barack Obama, who opposed the war originally. Obama, President Donald Trump, and Biden all criticized the Iraq War and have demonstrated skepticism toward nation-building interventions. Trump’s 2017 National Security Strategy, for example, states, “We are also realistic and understand that the American way of life cannot be imposed on others.”129 Nonetheless, their national security strategies all affirm the indispensability of engaged U.S. leadership and military primacy. For these scholars and leaders, the lesson of Iraq might be summed up as “Don’t do stupid shit,” as Obama once quipped. Instead, the country should carry on as the fulcrum of the liberal world order.130\nIt should surprise no one that these figures prefer Leffler’s security-focused narrative of the Iraq War. Figures like Brands, Kagan, John Bolton, and Eric Edelman, Cheney’s deputy national security adviser, favorably blurbed or reviewed Leffler’s book, which does little to critique U.S. grand strategy.131 Bolton, a neoconservative architect of the war, praises Leffler for recognizing that “Bush was not eager for war … his advisors did not lead him by the nose … they were not obsessed with linking Saddam to 9/11,” and “their objectives did not include spreading democracy at the tip of a bayonet.”132 Brands, who has labelled the Iraq War a “debacle” and “tragedy,” nevertheless calls Leffler’s book “the most serious scholarly study of the war’s origins” for many of the same reasons as Bolton.133\nScholars in the hegemony school could not disagree more about the Iraq War’s lessons. They contend that the war signals the bankruptcy of the overly ambitious and hyper-interventionist grand strategy of primacy. Primacy, as Wertheim argues, requires the United States to maintain U.S. forces around the globe and prevent the rise of great-power challengers, all while fueling a sense of messianic exceptionalism. He concludes that “the invasion of Iraq emerged from this logic,” and that, if the United States fails to fundamentally rethink its global role, it will rush headlong into more unnecessary conflicts.134\nFor these critics, the Iraq War also demonstrated the myopia and conformism of the bipartisan policy establishment and its seeming addiction to an expansive global mission. This establishment, they argue, remains committed to a hegemonic role that has brought unnecessary wars, stunning human and monetary costs, balancing behavior by rivals, and the discrediting of U.S. leadership at home and abroad.135 Deploying the Iraq War and other errors as a wedge, they aim to challenge the narrow, stultified conversation of the policy establishment and push U.S. grand strategy toward “realism and restraint,” in Walt’s words, while focusing more resources on preserving democracy and prosperity at home.136\nIn sum, competing interpretations of the war’s origins are entwined with debates about its lessons. It is proper that scholars contest how this war should inform the future of U.S. foreign policy. Nonetheless, partisans in this debate risk filtering history through ideological prisms and using it to win arguments. Still, this article suggests that even as the United States refocuses toward great-power competition, the meanings and lessons of the Iraq War remain hotly contested and highly consequential for America’s global role. This is especially true as the generation that fought the Iraq and Afghanistan wars enters leadership positions in the military and politics. Their interpretations of that conflict will matter immensely for how they think and act, just as competing viewpoints about the Vietnam War mattered for that generation.\nCultural and Global Turns for the Iraq War\nThis paper’s core claim is that scholarship on the causes of the Iraq War can be usefully organized into security and hegemony schools. These categories simplify a wide range of analysis, but they also permit a bird’s eye look at the field 20 years after the war began. At this point, the hegemony school probably has more adherents among scholars of the war, although the war’s architects gravitate to the security school.\nThe security-hegemony debate is not merely “academic.” It is a distinct interpretive divide that shapes how scholars approach their sources and leads to competing answers about other key questions. This divide also informs ongoing debates about U.S. foreign policy, with each school suggesting different lessons from the war. The polarization of the debate is real, but not ideal. Scholars should keep trying to synthesize these perspectives. Historians are particularly well suited for this task because they prioritize holistic, narrative, and multi-variable analysis rather than an insistence on parsimony and generalizability that is typically found among political scientists.\nOne way to challenge the security-hegemony binary may be to adopt new methodological approaches to the Iraq War. The security-hegemony divide operates largely within traditional approaches to the study of war. Hahn describes these methods as focusing on “the exercise of power, the conduct of diplomacy, the practice of international politics, the interest in domestic politics and public opinion, and the application of military strength by U.S. government officials who calculated the national interests and formulated policies designed to achieve those interests.”137\n“Many of these scholars have not consistently integrated cultural factors with the study of foreign policy or the causes of war.”\nNew approaches could refresh this seemingly entrenched binary. The global turn in Cold War historiography, for example, broke up a debate focused on orthodox and revisionist accounts of the Cold War’s roots. The conversation refocused itself on how the Cold War reshaped global history and intersected with trends like decolonization, as well as how the agency of smaller powers influenced the superpower struggle.138 Some scholars have already advanced more global accounts of the Iraq War by digging into Iraqi sources, the role of the United Nations, and the regional politics of the Iraq conflict.139 Until more sources are available on decision-making in the Bush administration, this may be a more productive route than further entrenchment in the security-hegemony divide.\nIn addition, a cultural turn may be constructive for Iraq War scholarship. The cultural turn in diplomatic history led to more attention on how cultural factors like race, gender, religion, language, and memory shape policy and strategy.140 Discussion of ideas and interests took a back seat to construction, imagination, narratives, symbols, and meaning in elite and popular culture.141 The transnational turn, moreover, highlighted the role of nonstate actors as important forces in the global arena. Scholars in this vein showed how a broader set of actors challenged the nation-state, formed networks, and exchanged ideas across borders, thus casting national politics in a global context.142\nThere has indeed been interesting work in history, anthropology, and post-colonial studies on the role of culture in the Iraq War and the “War on Terror.” Andrew Preston and Lauren Turek examine how religion shaped Bush’s worldview and foreign policy.143 Melani McAlister and Deepa Kumar explore how media and popular culture portrayals of the Middle East helped justify the use of force there to domestic audiences.144 Edward Said, Zachary Lockman, and others argue that the Iraq War should be understood in the context of Orientalist beliefs about supposedly backwards, dangerous Arabs and Muslims in need of the discipling hand of Western rule.145\nUnfortunately, this work has often been stovepiped from the mainstream scholarship on the Iraq War’s causes. Many of these scholars have not consistently integrated cultural factors with the study of foreign policy or the causes of war.146 More traditional scholars, in turn, often overlook culture, race, gender, religion, and other factors. Students of the Iraq War and all of post-9/11 foreign policy should close these gaps by asking how culture interacts with and shapes policy, the perception of rivals, and decision-makers’ understanding of themselves and America’s role in the world.147 There is considerable room for this kind of synthesis as scholarship of the Iraq War moves forward.\nJoseph Stieb is a historian and an assistant professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College.

As the first chart from our new content series InFact shows, although certainly not all of them became its subjects, Britain's warfaring efforts only spared precious few countries in the world.\nAccording to the book \"All the Countries We’ve Ever Invaded: And the Few We Never Got Round To\", there are only 22 countries Britain never invaded throughout history. There aren't many gaps on the map, but some of the more notable include Sweden, Belarus and Vatican City. The biggest blank spots can be seen on the African continent, even though the Royal African Company founded in 1660 alone was responsible for forcibly removing 212,000 slaves from their homeland and shipping them to English colonies in the Americas between 1662 and 1731.\nThe British Empire in its various iterations can be seen as one of the longest-lasting Western empires in the world. Its first permanent overseas colony in the Americas was established in 1607 in Jamestown, Virginia, while Hong Kong, its last big overseas territory, was handed over to China in 1997.

Federal spending is at an all-time high, and as a nation we are looking down the barrel of record trillion-dollar deficits and a more than $16 trillion debt, more than $53,000 per citizen.\nTaxpayers are sending nearly a trillion dollars of their income to the Treasury every year, just to watch Congress waste it on thousands of programs that duplicate other federal, state, and private efforts and cannot demonstrate any measure of success. Despite promises from Washington politicians that government programs can solve every challenge—taxpayers are being ripped off.\nIgnoring their responsibility to conduct oversight and determine if a given federal program is effective, members of Congress are often beholden to special interest groups and would rather continue funding an old program instead of eliminating it. At the same time, Congress will then create new programs that do the very same thing and do it just as poorly. There's no ineffective, inefficient program that the government can’t recreate at an even higher cost.\nThoughtful and careful legislating is a thing of past, and instead, Congress is in the business of creating press release programs, established not to truly fix a problem, but simply to give the appearance of action and concern. The result is a maze of bureaucracy and overlap, hundreds of billions of dollars spent on thousands of duplicative programs, and government waste and mismanagement as far as the eye can see.\nEven worse, the more we spend, the more the problems stay the same. Congress has created a program (or several in most cases) and poured billions of dollars into these programs, to address nearly every issue and problem faced by any individual, group, or entity across the country. And yet, many of these problems and challenges still exist today, as if the government never even tried to address it.\nMany of these challenges such as homelessness, poverty, education, juvenile delinquency, drug abuse, and hundreds others, remain today—homelessness rates, education testing, juvenile crime rates remain unchanged and unimproved, despite decades of federal programs and billions of dollars in taxpayer funding spent to alleviate and address these concerns.\nWe spend billions of dollars on hundreds of education programs, yet scores continue to fall and dropout rates are rising.\nWe spend billions of dollars on housing programs, yet thousands are still homeless.\nWe spend millions of dollars on dozens of job training, yet thousands are looking for work.\nIt is nearly impossible fully comprehend the vast expanse of federal programs that exist today. Although various sources, including USA Spending and documents released by OMB and CBO produce partial lists of various government programs, there is not an exhaustive list of federal programs. Every federal department is now administering programs that address challenges tasked to be addressed by other agencies. The government has grown so large and unmanageable, that even the experts, and the departments themselves, cannot compile a list of all federal programs within their purview.\nIn response, this January, the Senate passed an amendment directing the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to annually identify federal programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives with duplicative goals and activities, to estimate the cost of the duplication, and to make recommendations for consolidation and elimination of the duplication.\nGAO has been working long and hard on a report, as mandated by this provision, and early next year we hope to see the first in a series of reports fully outlining the extensive duplication throughout the federal bureaucracy. It will then be up to Congress to look objectively at GAO’s finding and begin eliminating and consolidating the thousands of duplicative government programs.\nExamples of Federal Duplication\nThere are over 14 programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education related to foreign exchanges and designed to increase opportunities for students to study abroad.\nAccording to GAO, to the tune of $30 billion, the federal government funds more than 44 job training programs, administered by nine different federal agencies across the federal bureaucracy.\nThe federal government administers at least 20 federal programs across 12 different federal offices and agencies, dedicated to the study of invasive species.\nThere are at least 17 offender reentry programs across five different federal agencies, costing taxpayers over $250 million annually.\nA May 2007 report of the Academic Competitiveness Council revealed there are at least 105 federal programs supporting science, technology, education, and math education, with aggregate funding of $3.12 billion in FY 2006.\nThere are at least nine federal programs tasked with researching and developing biofuels, costing taxpayers nearly $300 million annually, and over $800 million was included in the Stimulus bill for these initiatives.[1]\nClick here for an outline of federal savings from the elimination of waste and duplication.\nClick here for a general background of Dr. Coburn's speech highlighting government waste.\nSEQUESTER THIS: DUPLICATION NATION.

Its first three words—\"We the People\"—affirm that the government of the United States exists to serve its citizens. For over two centuries the Constitution has remained in force because its framers wisely separated and balanced governmental powers to safeguard the interests of majority rule and minority rights, of liberty and equality, and of the federal and state governments. Since 1789 the Constitution has evolved through amendments to meet the changing needs of a nation now profoundly different from the 18th-century world in which its creators lived.\nThe United States enjoys a representative form of government, shaped by three separate branches as established in the Constitution:\nA system of checks and balances, which the Constitution also sets forth, limits the powers of each branch.\nArticle I of the Constitution created and defined the United States Congress, granting to the two houses of the legislative branch such powers as the ability to collect taxes, coin money, raise and support an army, declare war, establish post offices, create patent laws, and establish a federal judicial system. It gave to the Senate the exclusive right to provide advice and consent to the president on treaties and nominations, and the sole power to try, and to remove from office, an impeached government official.\nMore than two centuries after its ratification, the United States Constitution remains a vital and living document, strengthened by amendments, serving as both guide and protector of U.S. citizens and their elected officials. It has survived civil war, economic depressions, assassinations, and even terrorist attacks, to remain a source of wisdom and inspiration.\nThe creation of the U.S. Constitution depended upon the knowledge, experience, and dedication of its framers, just as its endurance depends upon the knowledge and experience of each succeeding generation of Americans. For this reason, it is important for us to learn and understand the governing principles of our nation, set forth in the Constitution.\nTo encourage all Americans to learn more about the Constitution, Congress in 1956 established Constitution Week, to begin each year on September 17, the date in 1787 when delegates to the Convention signed the Constitution. In 2004 Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia included key provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 2005 designating September 17 of each year as Constitution Day and requiring public schools and government offices to provide educational programs to promote a better understanding of the Constitution.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        constitution day\nConstitution Day, also known as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, is an important observance in the United States that commemorates the signing of the U.S. Constitution on September 17, 1787. This historic document laid the foundation for the nation's government and remains the oldest written national constitution still in use today.\nConstitution Day serves as a reminder of the enduring principles and values that the Constitution represents, such as democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. It is a day to reflect upon the rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizens and to celebrate the enduring impact of this remarkable document on the nation's history and governance. Throughout the country, educational institutions, government agencies, and civic organizations hold various events and activities to promote awareness and understanding of the Constitution's significance, making it an essential part of American civic life.\nBelow is a list of resources you can engage with to learn more about the U.S. Constitution.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The Massachusetts Constitution: the Oldest in the United States, and Often Ahead of its Time\nA Massachusetts state court was the first to uphold the right to same-sex marriage on constitutional grounds.\nThis essay is part of a 50-state series about the nation’s constitutions. We’ve asked an expert from each state to dive into their constitution, narrate its history, identify its quirks, and summarize its most essential components for our readers.\nThe Massachusetts Constitution is the oldest written constitution in the world still in active use. After an earlier constitution failed to secure sufficient support, a constitutional convention was convened in September 1779, with a drafting subcommittee of John Adams, his second cousin Samuel Adams, and James Bowdoin. Bowdoin and Samuel Adams delegated the actual work of drafting to a subcommittee of one: John Adams. Adams completed the draft in October 1779 before sailing back to Europe on a diplomatic mission for the Continental Congress.\nSeveral colonies had already adopted constitutions, and Adams drew on these existing models. At the same time, Adams had his own well-developed ideas regarding constitutional governance. He was particularly influenced by the writings of English philosopher John Locke, a proponent of natural rights, and Montesquieu, the French judge and political theorist who coined the phrase “trias politica,” or separation of powers. Adams also reacted against the proposal for a unicameral legislature set out in Thomas Paine’s popular pamphlet Common Sense. Adams believed a bicameral legislature was necessary to avoid domination by self-interested individuals.\nAdams’s draft proposed three branches of government: an executive, an independent judiciary, and a bicameral legislature (in Massachusetts, the state legislature is known as the General Court). It also included an extensive bill of rights — prominently positioned as the constitution’s first substantive section — and a provision which committed the Massachusetts government to spread “the advantages and opportunities of education” as a necessary component of democracy. This latter provision was purportedly Adams’s favorite.\nThe new constitution was submitted for approval by popular vote, another Adams innovation, and was adopted in 1780 by a two-thirds majority of the eligible voters. In many respects, the Massachusetts constitution was the model for the U.S. Constitution of 1787, which John Adams also enthusiastically endorsed.\nYet even a thinker as enlightened and widely read as Adams had his limits. In 1776, Abigail Adams famously urged her husband to “remember the ladies” as he considered new governing frameworks for the Massachusetts colony and emerging federal government. Neither the original Massachusetts constitution nor the 1787 U.S. Constitution give any indication that he considered her pleas. It was about 190 years later, in 1976, that the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights was amended to recognize the inherent rights of “all people” rather than “all men,” and to specifically establish a right to “equality of the law” regardless of sex.\nDeclaration of Rights\nMassachusetts’s Declaration of Rights (as its bill of rights is called) is extensive, encompassing 30 articles, many of which are echoed in the federal Constitution. For example, the Massachusetts declaration includes provisions protecting free speech, freedom of religion, criminal procedure rights such as the right to speedy trial and to confront witnesses, and the right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures. However, the Massachusetts declaration at times provides more specificity than the federal Constitution. For instance, the Massachusetts Constitution provides an explicit right to vote, outlines the power of judicial review, and sets out a specific provision on the separation of powers, a framework which is only suggested by the structure of the federal Constitution. In addition, even when the Massachusetts declaration’s provisions are similar to their federal counterparts, they sometimes include distinctive wording with potential legal significance.\nThe state’s Declaration of Rights begins with the statement that “all people are born free and equal and have certain natural, essential and unalienable rights,” including liberty rights, rights to acquire and protect property, and rights to seek and obtain safety and happiness. The federal Constitution has no counterpart to this provision, which is instead reminiscent of the aspirational language of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. The Massachusetts version, a substantive constitutional guarantee derived from Locke’s views of natural rights, is similar to those found in more than 30 state constitutions. However, as written, Massachusetts’ inalienable rights provision went beyond those adopted earlier by Virginia and Delaware by indicating that these rights attach at birth — a swipe at supporters of slavery who argued that the rights were limited to free men. The 1976 addition of a state Equal Rights Amendment, recognizing a right to equality on the basis of sex, makes this provision even more distinctive.\nArticle XVII of the Declaration of Rights, concerning the “right to keep and bear arms,” is also notably different from the federal Constitution’s Second Amendment. Under the Massachusetts Constitution, “the people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence.” The state supreme court, called the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, has interpreted this provision literally and narrowly, concluding that the article does not guarantee a private right to own or possess weapons, and that reasonable regulation of arms is permitted under the state constitution.\nArticle XXVI of Massachusetts’s declaration bars the imposition of “cruel or unusual punishments,” a slight but potentially meaningful difference from the federal prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishment.” Despite a 1982 amendment to this article permitting imposition of the death penalty, the state’s high court effectively nullified the amendment by striking down, on fairness grounds, legislative efforts to reinstate a death penalty through statute. The “cruel or unusual punishments” provision of the Massachusetts declaration was also a critical factor when, in 2024, the Supreme Judicial Court was the first state court to go beyond federal precedent to categorically ban life without parole sentences for individuals ages 18 through 20 years old. The decision labeled this group “emerging adults.”\nUnique Characteristics\nThough its core provisions have remained intact since 1780, the Massachusetts Constitution has been amended more than 120 times. Environmental issues have received repeated attention. A 1918 amendment set out in Article XLIX extended the state’s police and condemnation powers. It characterized “conservation, development, and utilization of the agricultural, mineral, forest, water and other natural resources of the commonwealth” as “public uses” and required the paying of just compensation for takings. Article XLIX was annulled and replaced in 1972 to recognize the people’s rights to “clean air and water, freedom from excessive and unnecessary noise, and the natural, scenic and esthetic qualities of their environment.” Courts in Montana and Pennsylvania have found similar state constitutional amendments from the 1970s to create private rights of action, but there has not been significant environmental rights litigation under the Massachusetts provision. Interestingly, Massachusetts’ constitution is alone in the nation in addressing “excessive and unnecessary noise” as an environmental issue.\nA Strong Executive and Judiciary\nWithin the framework of the three branches of government, John Adams introduced several nuances to ensure a balance between the branches. Whereas many state constitutions give greater power to the legislature, Adams sought to strengthen the executive and the judiciary. For example, the Massachusetts Constitution expanded the authority of the governor to veto legislative enactments. This innovation was later adopted in the federal Constitution.\nImportantly, since 1780, members of the state judiciary have been appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Executive Council, also known as the Governor’s Council. Unlike most states, Massachusetts does not have state judicial elections. Further, Adams’s constitution provided members of the Supreme Judicial Court “should hold their offices as long as they behave themselves well,” a provision that was amended in 1972 to impose mandatory retirement at age 70. Adams believed that gubernatorial selection and life tenure would best ensure judicial independence, while also increasing the judicial power vis-à-vis the other branches. The same approach was later endorsed by the federal framers when they adopted life tenure for federal judges.\nAmendment Process\nAdams’s original 1780 constitution made no provision for amendments. Instead, constitutional changes were considered periodically during constitutional conventions called by the state legislature. In 1918, the constitutional convention enacted Article XLVIII, which governs the amendment process.\nThere are three routes to amending the Massachusetts Constitution — an initiative amendment, a legislative amendment, or a convention-referred constitutional amendment — all of which require voter approval.\nAn initiative amendment is citizen-initiated and begins with a petition and collection of the requisite number of signatures. Article XLVIII prohibits proposed initiative amendments that relate to religion, judges, the courts, particular localities of the Commonwealth, specific appropriations, and certain provisions of the state constitution’s Declaration of Rights. Of the states, Massachusetts sets the lowest bar for such citizen-initiated amendments, requiring amendment supporters to obtain signatures equal to just 3 percent of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election. An initiative amendment petition must be considered during two joint sessions of the Massachusetts legislature and must be supported by 25 percent of the legislature during each of these sessions. If the proposed amendment receives enough legislative support, it is put on the next general election ballot. To be adopted, at least 30 percent of the voters who cast ballots in the election must vote in favor of the amendment, and a majority of the ballots cast on the question must also be affirmative.\nThe legislature may also propose a constitutional amendment. Such a proposal must receive majority approval (50 percent plus one vote) during two successive joint legislative sessions to be placed on the ballot. A constitutional convention convened by the legislature may also propose an amendment, subject to ratification by voters. A legislative amendment or an amendment initiated by constitutional convention can pass with a simple majority of voters in that election.\nJudicial Interpretation\nThough it shares a history and some language with the federal Constitution, Massachusetts courts have rejected the idea of following federal Supreme Court interpretations in “lockstep.” Rather, when construing the state constitution, the Supreme Judicial Court typically leads with its own analysis of the state constitution’s text and history.\nFurther, the court has rejected rigid historical tests for ascertaining individual rights. While history serves as a guide, the court has stated that the constitution “is to be interpreted in the light of the conditions under which it and its several parts were framed, the ends which it was designed to accomplish, the benefits which it was expected to confer, and the evils which it was hoped to remedy.” In a 2022 decision, the Supreme Judicial Court specifically noted the negative impact that narrow historical tests could have on marginalized groups that were not recognized in 1780, and indicated it would reject such an approach if it perpetuated inequalities.\nOver nearly 250 years, the Massachusetts Constitution has been the basis for many important and influential cases, including three known as the Quock Walker cases. Decided between 1781 and 1783, these cases have seldom been cited as judicial precedent but have had a significant and ongoing impact on state constitutional drafting and interpretation.\nQuock Walker was a 28-year-old enslaved man from Worcester County who ran away from his brutal owner, Nathaniel Jennison. Walker obtained counsel and sued Jennison to win his freedom and obtain civil damages for assault and battery. The jury found for Walker, freeing him from slavery and awarding him £50 in damages (more than $13,000 today). A second case affirmed this result.\nJennison was then indicted on a criminal charge of assault and battery. He was tried in 1783, with the Supreme Judicial Court presiding, and found guilty. Chief Justice William Cushing, who served as the trial judge, instructed the jury that slavery in the state was disallowed under the inalienable rights clause of the 1780 constitution. This resolution encouraged anti-slavery forces to press for similar language in other state constitutions across the country.\nMore than two centuries later, in 2003, the Supreme Judicial Court decided Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, upholding the constitutional right of same-sex couples to marry. It was the first state court to uphold the right to same-sex marriage on constitutional grounds, and it issued that ruling more than a decade before the federal Supreme Court reached the same conclusion in Obergefell v. Hodges. In reaching its decision, the Goodridge court emphasized that the “Massachusetts Constitution is, if anything, more protective of individual liberty and equality than the Federal Constitution; it may demand broader protection for fundamental rights; and it is less tolerant of government intrusion into the protected spheres of private life.” Significantly, the court concluded that it need not apply heightened scrutiny to evaluate the claim under either due process or equal protection, since the prohibition on same-sex marriage failed even the lowest level of rational basis review. The case has been cited in dozens of subsequent cases, including by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nFinally, in a series of more recent cases, the Supreme Judicial Court has demanded that the criminal law take into account the life experiences of racial minorities. In Commonwealth v. Warren, decided in 2016, the court unanimously held that flight is not per se evidence of guilt when a Black man flees police. According to Justice Geraldine Hines, who authored the court’s opinion, such a flight “might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity.” In 2020, in Commonwealth v. Evelyn, the court extended the protection for fleeing to other “nervous or evasive behavior” when confronted by the police. On the same day, the court issued Commonwealth v. Long, eliminating the requirement that a defendant trying to prove that he was subject to an illegal racially-motivated traffic stop must produce statistical evidence showing racial bias by that officer or in that jurisdiction. That burden was too high, the court concluded, and it adopted the requirement that the defendant must simply establish “a reasonable inference” that the officer’s decision to initiate the stop was motivated by race, based on the specific circumstances surrounding the stop.\nThese cases and other highlights selected here are just an introduction to the history and scope of the Massachusetts Constitution. With a constitution that has been in operation almost 250 years, that is so intertwined with our nation’s history, and that is still supporting judges in resolving today’s legal problems, there is always something new to explore.\nMartha F.

Bush. A member of the Republican Party, he was the 42nd governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001 and Republican floor leader in the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1981 to 1987. Thompson is the longest-serving governor in Wisconsin history and is the only person to be elected to the office four times.\nDuring his tenure as governor he was also chair of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He was chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 1991 and 1992, and the National Governors Association in 1995 and 1996. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson became a partner in the law-firm Akin Gump and Independent Chairman of Deloitte's Center for Health Solutions. He has served on the boards of 22 other organizations.[1] Thompson most recently served as interim president of the University of Wisconsin System from 2020 to 2022.[2][3]\nThompson was a candidate for President of the United States, running in the 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries, but withdrew from the race before voting began.[4] He was the Republican nominee for United States Senate in Wisconsin in the 2012 election, vying to replace retiring senator Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Democrat Tammy Baldwin in what was his only statewide election loss.[5]\nEarly life, education, and military service\n[edit]Childhood and family\n[edit]Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[6][7] His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[8][9][10] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[11]\nHe has a daughter, Kelli Thompson, who was Wisconsin's state public defender until she stepped down in 2023.[12]\nEducation\n[edit]Thompson earned his bachelor and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[6][7] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[13][14][15]\nMilitary service\n[edit]Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[16] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[16]\nAfter completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[17][18] His final rank was captain.[18]\nEarly political career (1966–1987)\n[edit]Wisconsin Assembly\n[edit]Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[16] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[16]\nIn 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and its minority leader in 1981.[19] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname \"Dr. No\" by the frustrated majority.[20][21]\nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council\n[edit]As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[22][23][24][25] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: \"I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'\"[22][23][24] ALEC awarded Thompson its \"Thomas Jefferson Award\" in 1991.[26]\n1979 congressional campaign\n[edit]While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[27] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[28] State Senator Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.\nGovernor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)\n[edit]Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[29]\nElections\n[edit]- 1986\nThompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[30] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[31]\n- 1990\nThompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[32]\n- 1994\nThompson won election to a third term defeating Democratic state senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[33]\n- 1998\nThompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[34]\nTenure\n[edit]Thompson is best known nationally for changes in Wisconsin's welfare system,[21] which was radically downsized,[35] before similar ideas were adopted nationally.[21] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[21]\nThompson was called a \"pioneer\" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[36][37] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[38]\nThompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. At the time, Wisconsin governors had the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[39]\nThompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[21] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote that \"many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare\". Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[21]\nThe growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[40]\nTransportation focus\n[edit]Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[21] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be secretary of transportation.[21]\nWhile governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[41][42][43] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[44]\nBeginning in the 1990s, Thompson proposed modernizing passenger rail in the state.[45] In 1999, Thompson proposed a modernization and extension of the Hiawatha rail service (between Chicago and Milwaukee),[46] extending to beyond Milwaukee to also serve Madison, Wisconsin and Minnesota's Twin Cities (Minneapolis–Saint Paul).[47] Thompson was promoting the \"Midwest Rail Initiative\" in his capacity as Amtrak's chairman, which included a proposal for a line connecting these cities. In early 2000, he gave further details, proposing first to establish new service between Milwaukee and Madison with $50 million in state funding and $100 million in federal funding, hoping to inaugurate a high-speed service by 2003,[47] which would include a station at Dane County Regional Airport.[48] As part of his plans, Thompson initiated preliminary studies that resulted in the construction of the Milwaukee Airport Rail Station.[49]\nTaxes\n[edit]In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[16] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[50] cutting income tax rates three times[51] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[52][53]\nWhen Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he \"never raised taxes\", he earned a rating of \"False\" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[53] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, \"Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way.\" Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[53]\nTwo of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[16] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[16] at the same time that he pushed forward a 6% cut in welfare benefits.[16]\nExecutive power consolidation\n[edit]As governor, Thompson took major steps to transfer decision-making power from elected constitutional officers and independent agencies to his political appointees.[16] Among the changes:\n- The Secretary of State's office was gutted of its responsibilities concerning business registration and Uniform Commercial Code administration.[54] These functions were in turn vested in Thompson's appointee at the newly created Department of Financial Institutions, which also regulates depository institutions and the securities industry.\n- Enforcement of consumer protection laws was taken away from the elected Wisconsin Attorney General and transferred to Thompson's appointee at what is now the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.\n- The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor, which for decades prior functioned as an ombudsman for the state's natural resources protected under the Public Trust Doctrine, had its budget significantly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.\n- An attempt was made to transfer education policy to an appointed education secretary after the constitutional head of the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, the elected Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin, saw most of the office's powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court later ruled the move unconstitutional.[16][55]\nThompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[16] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[16] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, \"despite a clear ruling\" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[16]\nTobacco\n[edit]As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[21] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[21] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and \"delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[21]\nAbortion\n[edit]Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[21]\nTreatment of Ojibwa spearfishers\n[edit]In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its \"Voigt Decision\", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[56] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[56][57]\nDuring his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[56] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[56] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the \"Voigt Decision\".[56] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[56]\nIn 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[57] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[58] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[56]\nOther leadership roles\n[edit]During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[16] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.\nConsideration as prospective Republican vice presidential nominee\n[edit]Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[16]\nRepublican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[16] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to \"bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements\", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[16] After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration in August, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been \"scared to death\" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[59] In 2000, Thompson was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for George W. Bush.[60]\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\n[edit]Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001. Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[61] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.\nWhile Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[61] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests, thereby providing health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[62] In the aftermath of 9/11, he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[63]\nKey initiatives\n[edit]Thompson's major initiatives were \"efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes.\"[64] He also was elected chairman of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2003.[65]\nMedicare prescription drug-benefit\n[edit]Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[66]\nAs part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[67] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[68]\nIn her Senate campaign, Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) said in 2012 that Thompson was responsible for forbidding Medicare to negotiate drug prices, a statement that Politifact rated as \"True.\"[69] Thompson said that he had nothing to do with that provision, a statement Politifact rated as \"False.\"[70][71] The New York Times reported, \"In December (2004), just before leaving office, Mr. Leavitt’s predecessor, Tommy G. Thompson, said he wished Congress had given him the authority to negotiate prices for Medicare beneficiaries, as he negotiated discounts on antibiotics during the anthrax scare of 2001.\"[72]\n2001 anthrax scare\n[edit]Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming \"utterly overtaken by events\" and issuing \"early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts\".[73]\nAt a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that \"would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication\".[74] Thompson offered the media a \"far-fetched\" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[75] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, as potentially undermining public confidence, and as the \"kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts\".[76][77] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[74]\nAlleged politicizing of science\n[edit]In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[78] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as \"lightweights\" with \"no scientific credibility.\" Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having \"signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush.\"[79] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a \"politicization of science\" under President George W. Bush's administration.[80][81]\nResignation press conference\n[edit]Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[64] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[82][83][84] Some noted, in particular, his words: \"I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that.\"[64]\nPost-government private sector work\n[edit]After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][85]\nThompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[86]\nIn 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[86]\nA number of those companies and organizations (as of 2012), \"he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors.\" An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that \"either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight.\"[86]\nThompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided \"strategic advice\" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]\nHe also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Independent Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Solutions.[85][87] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[85]\nInitial post-government political activities\n[edit]Soon after leaving office, Thompson began publicly proposing policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[88] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[88] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[88]\nThompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Harvard Kennedy School conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[89] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[90]\nOne of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[91]\n2008 presidential campaign\n[edit]After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[92]\nStatement about sexual orientation and workplace protections\n[edit]During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[93] He said, \"I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be.\"\nHe later claimed that he did not hear the question correctly, saying, \"It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace.\"[94] He would also claim that he had been feeling sick on the day of the debate, and that he was distracted when that question was asked by his own impending need to use a bathroom.[95]\nGaffe about Jews, Israel\n[edit]I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]\nI just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.\n— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007\nThompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.\n— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)\nIn April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[96]\nOn April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[97][98] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[99] Thompson stated: \"You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that.\"[98] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[100] adding: \"I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.\"[98] Thompson's comments caused \"unease in the room\" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[97][99]\nThompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as \"Jewish bonds\".[97][101][102] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[97][101]\nConference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[103]\nThe national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that \"there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become\" than Thompson's belief that \"repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!\"[99]\nAfter the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[96] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[97][101]\nIowa straw poll; withdrawal and endorsements\n[edit]Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed] In October, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that \"Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership.\" He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[104] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, \"No. I don't know who is.\"[105]\n2012 U.S. Senate election\n[edit]While Thompson gave some consideration to running for the governorship again in 2010, he more seriously considered running for the United States Senate in Wisconsin's 2010 election. Ultimately, however, he declined to run for either office in 2010.[46][106] On September 19, 2011, Thompson announced he would run in 2012 for the seat vacated by Herb Kohl.[107] He more formally launched his campaign with an announcement video on December 1.[108]\nPolitical positions during 2012 campaign\n[edit]During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, \"Who better than me, that's already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?\"[109] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[109]\nThompson favored making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15% flat tax.[110]\nRepublican primary\n[edit]After a bitter four-way race, Thompson won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012. His opponents in the primary had included Eric Hovde (a millionaire hedge fund manager), Mark Neumann (a former congressman), and Jeff Fitzgerald (speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly).[111] During the primary, attention was raised to the fact that in 2008 Thompson had given campaign contributions to two Democrats[112] – $250 to Michigan U.S. senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. That same election cycle, he had given $1,200 to the Wisconsin Republican Party.[113] The attacks against Thompson led to Mike Huckabee (a Republican who was the former governor of Arkansas, a former presidential candidate, and an active conservative media figure) offering a defense and endorsement of Thompson.[114]\nGeneral election\n[edit]Ahead of the general election, ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's campaign in the latter part of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, receiving 45.9% against Baldwin's 51.5%. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]\nLater political involvement\n[edit]Over the course of the Republican primaries for the United States presidential election of 2016 Thompson endorsed a number of candidates. Before the primaries, he initially endorsed Scott Walker's campaign. After Walker withdrew his candidacy, Thompson gave his endorsement to the campaign of Jeb Bush. In March 2016 (a month after Bush ended his campaign), Thompson endorsed the campaign of John Kasich and became chair of Kasich's Wisconsin state campaign operation.[115] In early July, Thompson, endorsed Donald Trump (the party's presumptive nominee)[116] and served as a delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention.\nThompson considered running for Wisconsin governor again in 2022, which would mean challenging incumbent Democrat Tony Evers. In March 2022, he visited Mar-a-Lago to consult with then-former president Trump about such a possibility. In April, Thompson claimed that he would not be running for governor. He claimed that he had received encouragement from Trump, but was ultimately dissuaded from running by objections from his own immediate family.[117] In July, Thompson gave his own endorsement in the Republican gubernatorial primary to Tim Michels (the Trump-backed candidate). Trump and Thompson's endorsements of Michels was seen as helping him to overtake former lieutenant governor Rebecca Kleefisch in the polls.[118] While Michels succeeded in securing the Republican nomination, he went on to lose to Evers.[119]\nIn October 2022, Thompson joined the Council for Responsible Social Media project launched by Issue One to address the negative mental, civic, and public health impacts of social media in the United States co-chaired by former House Democratic Caucus Leader Dick Gephardt and former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey.[120][121]\nThompson served as a delegate to the 2024 Republican National Convention (held in Milwaukee), and delivered a speech at the convention. Thompson claimed that it was the twelfth consecutive Republican convention to which he had been a delegate.[122] In the 2024 presidential election, Thompson once again endorsed Trump, and sent Trump's campaign advice on campaigning in Wisconsin.[122][123] Thompson also campaigned alongside Trump in Wisconsin.[124]\nPresident of the University of Wisconsin System (2020–22)\n[edit]In the fall of 2019, incumbent University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross announced his intention to retire. This kicked off a search by the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents to find his successor.[125] In what was seen as a flawed candidate search, complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic in Wisconsin, the board initially was poised to offer the position to University of Alaska System President Jim Johnsen.[2] Johnsen was ultimately forced to withdraw amidst vocal opposition from University of Wisconsin System faculty and students.[126] A week later, after closed-door sessions, the board named Thompson as the interim president.[2] Thompson served nearly two years as interim president before announcing in January 2022 that he would step down, effective March 18, 2022.[127]\nElectoral history\n[edit]Wisconsin Assembly (1966–1970)\n[edit]| Party | Candidate | Votes | % | ±% | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Republican primary, September 13, 1966 | |||||\n| Republican | Tommy Thompson | 2,697 | 56.67% | ||\n| Republican | Louis C.

Robin L. Webb, R-Grayson, shared her thoughts on what she learned as co-chair of the Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force while giving an overview on the group’s 2026 legislative recommendations.\nWebb said the first recommendation is for Kentucky to establish a state resiliency office.\n“It would be a coordinating body for preparedness, resilience and mitigation efforts,” she said.\nWebb said the resiliency office would collect data and track how disaster recovery and resiliency efforts are expended and what resources are available. Additionally, the office would also focus on urban planning, structures, transportation projects and mitigation efforts.\n“Just agencies talking to one another and sharing maps and sharing data and talking to one another on a regular basis – that’s what I envision for the state resilience office,” Webb added.\nThe second recommendation from the task force is to continue to meet and study disaster prevention and resiliency in 2026.\n“Whether it’s a task force like we’re doing now or oversight committee or a regular committee, whatever that form is, the general assembly needs to be involved,” Webb said.\nThis year, the task force learned about ways Kentucky can improve building code policy, water level monitoring systems and other disaster preparedness efforts. Webb said the task force is recommending the general assembly “make the expenditures necessary” to address those concerns.\nProviding displaced Kentuckians shelter following a natural disaster is also something that needs to be improved, Webb said. A community-based approach, rather than utilizing Kentucky State Parks lodging facilities, will be recommended.\nGrowing urban search and rescue and swift water rescue teams, investing in disaster mitigation efforts and increasing public education and awareness are also recommendations of the task force, Webb said.\nCo-chair Rep. Chris Freeland, R-Benton, said local, long-term recovery groups is another effort the task force is going to recommend supporting.\nFreeland believes only 13 Kentucky counties have a long-term recovery group, with Mayfield – the site of the deadly 2021 tornado – being one of them.\n“We need every county to do that, all 120, to have long-term recovery groups because they can’t accept any donations or do the things that they need until they have that,” Freeland said, adding that expanding access to case management for survivors, streamlining benefit verification and reducing duplication of services are also priorities.\nFreeland said the task force has “barely scratched the surface” on what more can be done to improve disaster prevention and resiliency in Kentucky. He hopes the task force can continue next year and that the general assembly will consider some of the task force’s recommendations.\n“Since 2020, billions of dollars in damage has been done, and if we can invest a little bit of money and a lot of effort, I think we can do a lot of things to help Kentucky and to help the people here,” Freeland said.\nRep. Mitch Whitaker, R-Fleming-Neon, said he believes the resiliency office recommendation is “critically important.”\n“I know that most of us here, if not all of us, would consider ourselves fiscal conservatives and creating a new division of government always makes people feel a little uneasy,” Whitaker said. But when you’re looking at the cost of rebuilding time after time, the cost of preparation and resiliency will save our commonwealth so much money in the long run.”\nThe task force unanimously adopted its list of recommendations. Friday was the last day the task force was scheduled to meet in 2025.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nFRANKFORT — The Hatfield-McCoy Feud Trail is important not only for its history, but also for tourism dollars the popular sites generate in Eastern Kentucky, according to testimony to a state committee Thursday.\nThree advocates – Bob Scott, Tony K. Tackett and Jay Shepherd – from Pikeville-Pike County Tourism testified to the Interim Joint Committee on Tourism, Small Business, and Information Technology about the significance of signage and tourism growth in the area.\n“The visitors to the Hatfield-McCoy area increase every year by the thousands,” said Tackett, a descendant of the Hatfield family.\nBut even some residents may not know much history about the Hatfields and McCoys, he said. Sometimes GPS devices and cell phones won’t work in the area, and that’s one reason why signs are needed, Tackett said.\n“The cell signal just does not get down in there, and people are lost. They spend most of their time running around looking for the sites,” he said.\nShepherd said signage is needed along US Route 119 and State Highways 319 and 1056. He said strategic signage would not only help people find their way around the area, but also help market the sites.\nAccording to the presentation, tourists spent $72.93 million in Pike County in 2017. That number rose to $114.6 million in 2024.\n“Does this replace the coal mining industry that has kind of fell apart in our region? No. But does it offset a lot of issues economically in our region? Absolutely,” Shepherd said. “It’s one leg of many legs that we need to explore in making Pike County economically strong. And it also helps in tax revenues as well, obviously.”\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, described the Hatfields and McCoys as having the most famous and perhaps infamous history in Eastern Kentucky.\nRep. Ryan Dotson, R-Winchester, noted that he’s related to both families and grew up in the area.\n“Growing up there, that was just a story that we were always told. We understood the story but didn’t really know the significance of it until we got out of the area. When I got in the Army, everybody talked about the Hatfields and McCoys. Traveled the world – everybody talked about the Hatfields and McCoys. So I think this is long overdue,” he said.\nRep. Mitch Whitaker, R-Fleming-Neon, said he’s very proud to represent part of Pike County – the history, the geography and the people. He asked the trio if lodging is sufficient in the area and if the area is falling behind surrounding states.\n“I know we want to work collaboratively, but at the same time, we have to make sure that Kentucky dollars circulate in Kentucky as much as possible,” he said.\nScott said a new hotel is expected to be constructed in Pikeville within the next three years and there does need to be more signage, lodging and marketing.\n“It’s about keeping the mom and pop alive. We can keep them alive. We’ll be good,” Scott said.\nTackett said that the allure of knowing more about the Hatfields and McCoys exists.\n“We’re sitting on an opportunity with this because for some reason, people love the word Hatfield and McCoys. It’s either the feudin’, the fussin’ or it’s kind of like Romeo and Juliet. It’s also a love story,” he said.\nFRANKFORT — The Artificial Intelligence Task Force 2025 on Thursday advanced recommendations for the Kentucky General Assembly to consider during the upcoming legislative session – a main goal of the group.\nCo-Chairs Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, and Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, outlined the 10 recommendations during the panel’s last meeting before the session kicks off in January.\n“We tried to incorporate everybody’s recommendation. Some of them are federal issues that would be more appropriate there, and so we’ve got a recommendation of that. But thank you to everyone who sent those in,” Bray said.\nAmong the recommendations, the task force is asking lawmakers to consider changes to state law that would strengthen protections for consumer data as artificial intelligence – known as AI – continues to evolve.\nThe panel also recommends that lawmakers consider updates to AI policies for state agencies along with stronger policies to protect minors on social media from the potential effects of AI.\nAnother recommendation seeks acknowledgement that AI may impact careers, and the task force is asking lawmakers to collaborate with professional standards boards regarding the use of AI in certain professions.\nA full list of the recommendations is available here.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said the section on minors is an excellent recommendation because it promotes online safety for children and parents. He said he hopes the legislature will take action during the session on the issue.\n“We see every day here in America discussions of sexual exploitation of minors, sexual trafficking of minors. We know it occurs with a great deal of frequency. And AI is out here every day causing harm and danger to our children,” he said.\nThomas added that two other recommendations dealing with data centers are important and data centers should not be built in Kentucky without an environmental impact survey. He cited concerns about how power usage by data centers could impact people and businesses already on the electrical grid.\n“I don’t think that that cost should be passed on to the current users of that electrical system,” he said. “I think if there’s an increased cost that comes with data center construction or use, then that data center should pay for that increased cost, not the current consumers or the current business users who were using it before the data center came online.”\nThe recommendations call on lawmakers to consider polices related to the location of data centers in Kentucky and their use of water and power resources.\nBray said Thomas’s concerns are why those sections were drafted. He recalled past solar legislation that dealt with similar issues.\n“If you’ll remember the solar bill that passed a few years ago, it provided minimum requirements on setbacks, on decommissioning bonds, making sure that if a solar farm were to be decommissioned, there was money there to make it right so that local landowners wouldn’t be tasked with that,” he said.\nBray said the Kentucky Public Service Commission completes a grid usage study regarding capacity and availability when a large user seeks approval. He agreed that lawmakers do not want electric bills to increase due to power consumption from a data center.\n“We’ve had a lot of conversation with power companies, data centers, the Public Service Commission, so there will be a bill coming to address those exact concerns,” Bray said.\nSen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, pointed to one recommendation that would incorporate AI development and governance into the jurisdiction of legislative committees. He said the jurisdiction should fall under the Natural Resources and Energy Committee.\n“There’s a one-to-one relationship between data centers and energy,” he said.\nThe general assembly created the task force to study the use of AI throughout Kentucky to foster innovation and competitiveness, to promote AI literacy and to ensure AI development and governance in Kentucky, including data centers.\nMays Bledsoe said the task force has been a “wonderful tool” for the last two years, educating legislators and offering a path forward toward a long-term plan.\n“It’s been a really good committee, and I’ve been really grateful for our conversations,” she said.\nFRANKFORT — In its final meeting of 2025, the Commission on Race and Access to Opportunity heard testimony Wednesday on legislation that would create a trust fund for juvenile justice-related services.\nCommission member Sen. Keturah J. Herron, D-Louisville, said she plans to file Bill Request 1218 next year, which is similar to legislation she filed when she served in the Kentucky House of Representatives.\nHerron said she noticed during her term in the House that funding for facilities was typically at the forefront of the juvenile justice conversation.\n\"What I realized was that we are looking to put a lot of money into facilities, but we were not putting money on the backside, or I guess upstream, for prevention, intervention and reentry,\" she said.\nUnder BR 1218, Herron originally proposed a $9.6 million allocation to a Juvenile Services Fund within the Department of Juvenile Justice. Larry Forester, a citizen member of the commission, suggested Herron round the $9.6 million allocation to $10 million, which she agreed to.\nThe funding would come from state appropriations, gifts, grants and federal funds, according to the bill draft.\nHerron said the fund would create a consistent source of money at the state level for delinquency prevention and early intervention services, wraparound services, and alternative detention and reentry programs.\nHerron told the committee she is already aware of organizations across the state that are providing some of these services that could use more support.\n\"I think if we as a state, if we're putting all this money into facilities, it is our job as well to help on the backside of that,\" she added.\nHerron said she hopes the proposed legislation can be part of the solution when it comes to improving the lives of Kentucky's youth and addressing juvenile justice issues.\n\"It's not going to be the sole answer for the issues that we have, but I do think that it is one piece in part of the solutions we can do,\" she said.\nCommission co-chair Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, asked Herron if a national nonprofit would be able to donate to the fund and then Kentucky organizations could apply for grants from that fund.\nHerron said yes. She also added she would also like to see the state get creative with the request for proposal (RFP) process by looking at a particular issue for a particular county and issuing a specific RFP for that issue and location.\nOne example Herron gave was suicide prevention services for youth in Northern Kentucky.\n\"It's a very innovative way to address all of these different issues through this,\" she said.\nCitizen Member Kimberly Baird asked Herron to clarify who might qualify to receive a grant from the trust fund and who would oversee the distribution of the funds.\nHerron said she thinks the Juvenile Justice Oversight Council would be useful to help inform the department on how to distribute the funds to any type of local government entity, law enforcement entity, nonprofit groups or school districts.\nMays Bledsoe thanked Herron for her work on the legislation.\n\"It's really interesting and definitely innovative and creative,\" Mays Bledsoe said. \"It's a tough problem, and you've seen it throughout the commonwealth.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on new legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA copy of Herron's proposed legislation can be found here.\nFRANKFORT — A proposed job training and education center in Boyle County for Kentucky inmates could help further reduce the state's recidivism rate, according to supporters.\nRep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, and Sen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, introduced the idea to the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary on Thursday. Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) President Ryan Quarles and Director of Reentry Services with the Kentucky Department of Corrections Kirstin Porter joined them.\nDecker credits KCTCS's current partnership with the Department of Corrections for the recent drop in Kentucky's recidivism rate.\nThe college system already has nine colleges working with 14 state-run correctional facilities, one federal prison and numerous local jails on GED, associate and bachelor's degrees, and vocational job training, Quarles said.\nDecker told the committee they would like to keep working together on recidivism and workforce participation by opening a model campus at a state prison for 400 vetted inmates to enroll in intensive education and vocational programs near their scheduled release dates.\n\"Every Kentuckian has a stake in this fight against recidivism, regardless of any personal ties to incarceration,\" Decker said. \"Because when inmates return home with proven skills, they are far more likely to stay out of prison in the future, to contribute to their communities and to ensure safer neighborhoods for all Kentuckians.\"\nDecker said Kentucky defines recidivism as reincarceration within 24 months of release. Kentucky's recidivism rate dropped earlier this year by 1.6 points to 30.81%, but if measured by the national standard of three years, Kentucky's recidivism rate is much higher, she said.\n\"(It's) a standard that measures Kentucky's rate of recidivism as being 40.2% higher than any border state, but declining faster than the U.S. average,\" Decker added.\nThe program proposed by Decker, Storm, Quarles and Porter on Thursday is modeled after a successful program in Michigan called Vocational Village, where the state has seen a 50% drop in recidivism, Quarles said.\nQuarles said they are proposing a KCTCS reentry campus at the North Point Training Center in Boyle County due to its already existing partnerships and prison education programs.\n\"We're building upon a model that's working in Michigan, and we think we can do it right here in Kentucky as well,\" he added.\nStorm told the committee the program would enhance public safety and would be a fiscally responsible program for the commonwealth to pursue.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, said he appreciates the mission of the proposed program. He asked which criminal offenses would make an inmate ineligible.\nQuarles said a list has not been finalized, but he knows Michigan does not allow sex offenders to enroll in a Vocational Village due to it being difficult for sex offenders to find employment.\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, said he believes the proposed program is needed, along with some other reentry-related legislation. He said some inmates are having trouble completing the required apprenticeship programs in order to earn a vocational certification.\nQuarles said the enabling legislation the group is working on can address those needs.\n\"One of the things that we want to be clear about is that this is not a criminal justice reform bill,\" Quarles said. \"This is about workforce and for those inmates that we know will be released having the best chance possible.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on new legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky may join its neighbors next year in implementing hands-free driving legislation.\nSen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, told the Interim Joint Committee on Transportation on Tuesday he plans to file South Carolina's version of the hands-free driving bill in 2026. Higdon also serves as co-chair of the committee.\nThis is not the first time Higdon has sponsored this type of legislation.\n\"The proposed legislation would close current loopholes by requiring hands-free technology for cellphones be used while driving,\" Higdon said, adding he believes this version would address some concerns other lawmakers had about previous drafts of the bill.\nDistraction-free driving advocate Alyssa Burns testified in-favor of the legislation alongside Higdon. In 2022, Burns's daughter Camberleigh was killed when a distracted driver struck their vehicle in Louisville. She was 13 days away from turning 2.\nBurns said their vehicle was at a complete stop in a construction zone, and Camberleigh was properly restrained in her car seat when the collision happened. She said the driver of the other vehicle admitted he was distracted.\n\"We'll never know her full potential because of a reckless driver, who, by the way, was not prosecuted only because he said he wasn't paying attention,\" Burns said. \"He had no drugs in his system. He had no alcohol.\"\nHigdon told the committee that around 20% of Kentucky's 814 vehicle collision fatalities in 2023 were caused by distracted driving.\nUnder Bill Request 238, or the Phone-Down Kentucky Act, drivers would be prohibited from using any part of their body to use a mobile electronic device while driving.\nHidgon said the legislation defines a mobile electronic device as a cell phone, portable computer, GPS, electronic gaming system, or any device used to communicate, display or record digital content. The bill includes exceptions for certain radio communication devices and if a driver needs to report an emergency, accident or safety hazard.\n\"Kentucky remains to be one of the few states without a comprehensive handheld phone ban, despite rising fatalities,\" Higdon said.\nBR 238 would require violators pay a $100 fine. Collected fines would be distributed to the traumatic brain injury trust fund, the Kentucky trauma care system fund and the veterans' program trust fund, Higdon said.\nHe told the committee he believes reducing fatalities is a \"winnable battle.\"\n\"We can with this piece of legislation,\" Higdon added.\nSen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said he is \"happy to lend his support\" to Higdon's legislation, but would like to see a community service requirement added to the penalty provision.\n\"I do think that sometimes people make mistakes, but to make them go through and have some part of this where they have to spend some time either working on cases or seeing the results of their actions, maybe the first time we catch somebody, we help them never do this again,\" Smith said.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, said she also supports the legislation, but has concerns about an officer being able to catch a violator in the act.\n\"I would encourage some other opportunities for enforcement,\" she said.\nHigdon said he believes the legislative process would create an opportunity for Donworth to suggest that change.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on new legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of Higdon's proposed legislation can be found here.\nFRANKFORT — Two lawmakers joined with advocates from the mental health profession on Tuesday, urging the Interim Joint Committee on Banking and Insurance to support proposed legislation that seeks to improve mental health parity in insurance.\nRep. Vanessa Grossl, R-Georgetown, and Rep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, testified in support of the measure along with Sheila Schuster, chair of the Kentucky Mental Health Coalition, and Nicole Sartini, president of Bridge Counseling and Wellness in Louisville.\n\"The Kentucky General Assembly has recognized mental health as an issue for a number of years, and mental health needs to remain a priority for us,\" Grossl told the committee.\nShe said a measure from 2021 required insurers to treat mental health the same as physical health, and \"we're here today to discuss fidelity issues with that law to ensure that insurers are following the law with fidelity and that proper enforcement mechanisms are in place for those who do not.\"\nGrossl said the Kentucky Department of Insurance's ability to implement the current law has drawn concern.\n\"Reports from the department have not addressed mental health parity nor did last month's department update testimony to this committee. We believe additional legislative oversight is warranted,\" she said. \"At this point, we should have already been presented with two full years' worth of data via those annual reporting requirements that the bill clarified for insurers.\"\nThe proposed legislation would give oversight and enforcement capabilities to the legislature and the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General. It would also support consumers and providers with an advisory committee of experts in the field that reports to the attorney general, Grossl said.\nThe proposed legislation can be found here.\nWillner, a licensed psychologist, said the bill is fully bipartisan.\n\"That's because mental health care is not a partisan issue,\" she said, noting similar legislation from last year.\n\"I also want to point out that the bill is watermarked ‘draft,' so this is very much a work in progress.\"\nWillner said there has been significant policy progress on behavioral health parity in Kentucky and federally, but enforcement and situations providers face remain significant challenges.\n\"Access to in-network behavioral health services remains significantly less than access to in-network medical and surgical treatments,\" she said.\nThe federal 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act requires that health plans not design or apply financial requirements or treatment limitations differently for behavioral health than they would be for comparable medical or surgical benefits, but the burdens remain in Kentucky and federally, Willner said.\nSeveral legislators had questions for the individuals who testified. One of them was Sen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, who asked about mental health professionals who receive claw backs from insurers.\n\"Do you have to have any sort of pre-authorization before you administer services,\" she asked.\nSartini said her practice provides outpatient services and deals with fewer pre-authorizations than others.\n\"We're seeing that these are happening sometimes because someone has a primary insurance and then they also have a secondary insurance. And even though we are billing under the primary insurance, there's a conflict that sometimes causes claw backs, and no one will agree to pay for it,\" she said.\nRep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, said mental health parity is a complicated issue, and she respects mental health professionals but has concerns that the proposed legislation in its current form doesn't open avenues for access to care.\nRep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said it sounds reasonable that there should be mental health parity, but he thinks the mental health industry \"over compensates, over treats, over prescribes.\" He said many children are diagnosed with a condition that schools must approach like a disability.\n\"Now the educators have to look at them and consider their disability in how they accept behavior… because their disability may cause some particular action or some way they act out,\" he said.\nRep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, asked about a projected $300,000 cost in the proposed legislation.\nGrossl said it's preliminarily to hire two paralegals for the attorney general's office to ensure due diligence is met.\nSchuster said unless the legislature acts to ensure insurers follow rules, mental health and addiction problems won't be solved in Kentucky.\n\"Very few people are willing to admit that they, or someone in their family, has a mental health or addictive disorder that's going to need insurance. That's what stigma does, and it's still alive and well,\" she said.\nLegislators can't act on proposed legislation until the 2026 Regular Session begins in January.\nFRANKFORT — The Interim Joint Committee on Health Services on Wednesday received an update on medical cannabis dispensaries in the commonwealth.\nSenate Bill 47, adopted in 2023, called on the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services to implement, oversee and regulate a medical cannabis program in Kentucky for individuals with certain health disorders. The legislation designated 2025 as the first year of the program.\nCannon Armstrong, executive director of the state Office of Medical Cannabis, said most program practitioners are advanced practice registered nurses and medical doctors. There are 78 counties represented by practitioners throughout the state and multiple practitioners in some of those counties.\nAccording to the Office of Medical Cannabis, which operates under the auspices of the health cabinet, medical cannabis is \"a written certification-based product from the flowers of the Cannabis sativa L. plant. Armstrong said qualifying conditions for obtaining the product include cancer, chronic pain, chronic nausea, multiple sclerosis, post traumatic stress disorder and seizure disorder.\nChronic pain and PTSD are the two most common qualifying conditions now, Armstrong said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, asked officials about a $25 fee that has been waived for patients who were approved to receive a medical cannabis card.\nArmstrong said waiving the fee was one of the only ways officials could reduce costs for cardholders.\n\"As you know, this medication is not going to be covered by insurance, so they're still going to have to pay their practitioners to see them too, and that's not something that we have the ability to waive or be involved in in regard to the actual practitioner fee from our office,\" he said.\nArmstrong mentioned a dispensary in Ohio County – The Post Dispensary. According to the dispensary's website, the facility is expected to open this fall, and it is the state's first fully approved medical cannabis dispensary.\nOther dispensaries are following suit, he said.\n\"Forty-six of our 48 dispensaries are in their forever homes. They've found their permanent locations. We have two more that still need to be settled, but we're working on that. We should have those done before the end of the year,\" Armstrong said.\nRep. Robert Duvall, R-Bowling Green, asked if any investigations have occurred outside the application review to determine if the applicant or license winner has infrastructure, personnel and capital to operate on the first day of business.\nScotty McFarlan, deputy executive director of the Office of Medical Cannabis, said for a license to be issued, the applicant must meet all the requirements in the application process. He said the office's enforcement division is answering questions and helping applicants throughout the process.\nRep. Scott Sharp, R-Ashland, said he has heard about applicants who have rented out a single residence and filed multiple applications to operate a dispensary under varying company names. He asked if officials at the Office of Medical Cannabis have checked on this issue.\nArmstrong answered no, not at this time.\n\"I would recommend considering that,\" Sharp answered.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, and Moser voiced concerns about the characteristics of cannabis gummies, especially appearance. Armstrong said the actual gummies are expected to be colored.\n\"The Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Panel met yesterday and, once again, the majority of cases that we heard were ingesting cases from children – some of them THC,\" Carroll said. He called colored gummies a \"terrible mistake.\"\nArmstrong said packing for gummies will be child resistant, require a two-step process for the initial opening and will include a tamper-evident seal that is resealable.\n\"We're also doing an outreach regarding this topic, including where it should be stored in homes like other prescription medications are,\" Armstrong said.\nBerg said the gummies need to look like medicine, because they're being treated as medicine.\nHouse Minority Whip Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, said she is highly optimistic about the program and how it can improve patients' lives. She said distributors, growers and dispensary owners have provided positive feedback, calling Kentucky's program one of the best in the country.\n\"The thoughtfulness of the regulations, the way that this has been structured, makes them feel confident that they are able to do business in a way that is safe, is well-regulated,\" she said. \"They feel confident that they're going to be able to help Kentucky patients without exposing children, and I think that's important to everyone in this room,\" she said.\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky Housing Task Force 2025 heard testimony Tuesday on using land owned by religious institutions to build affordable housing.\nThis isn't the first time lawmakers have proposed the idea. But Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, and Rep. Michael Sarge Pollock, R-Campbellsville, hope their legislation will become law during the upcoming legislation session, which kicks off Jan. 6.\n\"We started it in the Senate last year and passed it out of the Senate with ease. It was well accepted and got to the House, and I won't say it had a lot of opposition, but a lot of questions,\" Higdon said, noting that Pollock will reintroduce the bill in the House next year.\nHigdon said the proposal is still a work in progress after he and Pollock were invited to meet with the Sisters of Loretto, a religious community based in Marion County.\nTwo nuns from the community knew about legislation filed in the U.S. Senate and broached the idea with the Kentucky legislators. Similar legislation also has been proposed in other states, Higdon said.\nHigdon said the concept allows religious institutions to bypass some local zoning rules and build affordable housing on church property.\nZoning laws are restrictive and deal with things such as square footage, parking, lot size, single family housing and multi-family housing, he said.\n\"This bill simply lets them bypass most of those too. They have to follow building codes, and the final phase of it before it can be built, it has to be approved by the local governing body,\" Higdon said.\nPollock said when the bill came to the House last year, it was more broad than desired, and the short legislative session didn't allow time for the bill to be passed.\nThe proposal is expected to be \"tweaked\" a bit, and commercial zones would be the main target for religious institution land use, Pollock said.\n\"We're here today to ask for this task force to endorse our bill this upcoming session,\" he said.\nRep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, thanked Higdon and Pollock for their legislation. He said he has heard from those involved with religious institutions in his district and others parts of Jefferson County who strongly support the developments.\n\"I'm a big supporter of it. Can't wait to see it in the House again,\" Watkins said.\nTask Force Co-Chair Rep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, also thanked Higdon and Pollock for their bill. She asked what would happen if religious institutions want to transfer their property to a non-religious institution.\nHigdon said the issue is still being considered as lawmakers look to return with the bill next year.\nThe next meeting of the task force is scheduled for Nov. 24 at 1 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — Two Kentucky lawmakers are hoping 2026 will be the year a bill to remove the state mandate for fluoride in Kentucky's drinking water crosses the finish line.\nRep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, has filed legislation similar to House Bill 16 from the 2025 legislative session nine times, he said. The bill did not become law this year, but did receive House approval.\nOn Tuesday, Hart was joined by Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, and other stakeholders at the Interim Joint Committee on State Government meeting to testify on a new version of HB 16.\nHart plans to carry the bill in the House, and Elkins said he would file companion legislation in the Senate next year.\n\"The legislation simply undoes the unfunded mandate in the state of Kentucky that requires water producers to add fluoride to the water,\" Hart said.\nThe newer version of the legislation from Hart would protect local water districts from civil and criminal liability, he said. The decision to add this provision to the bill is the result of conversations with water districts.\n\"One of the biggest concerns we heard was they were worried about possible litigation,\" Hart said. \"Doesn't matter whether they keep fluoride in water or take it out, they are afraid they're going to be sued with whatever decision is made.\"\nDr. Jack Kall, a dentist and the executive chair of the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology, shared scientific studies with the committee that show water fluoridation might cause lower IQ in children, among other health concerns.\nKall said the fluoride in most toothpaste and other fluoride treatments administered by dentists are sufficient in preventing tooth decay.\nHart said his legislation is an effort to make water fluoridation a local decision in light of newer studies on the risks and benefits of water fluoridation.\n\"We're not promoting fluoride one way or another – good or bad,\" Hart said. \"We're trying to steer away from that conversation, because that's not what the legislation does. However, with some of the stuff in the media today, we thought it was necessary to give you a little bit of an education on the risks and benefits for it.\"\nElkins said he considers the proposed legislation to be \"permissive\" rather than a requirement.\n\"It's more of a local control bill to me than anything else,\" he said.\nIn commenting on the proposed legislation, Rep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, said all of the countries that do not have water fluoridation mentioned in Kall's presentation have \"robust, publicly funded dental programs.\"\nHe wondered if Kentucky should be funding water fluoridation and other dental health initiatives instead of leaving water fluoridation as an unfunded state mandate.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, said he's received multiple messages asking him to oppose legislation that removes community water fluoridation programs, but he believes the proposed legislation is more about local control.\n\"This is a good piece of legislation that expands the ability for community-based decision making,\" Roberts said. \"I think it's backed up by data, and I fully support this.\"\nIn a continuation of the local control discussion, Rep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, asked Hart if the new version of HB 16 would require a public hearing. Hart said no, but he wouldn't be opposed.\n\"Maybe you might consider something like that to just make sure that the local people in the local communities are informed, and they have an opportunity to (provide) input on decisions of their local water district board,\" Tipton said.\nSen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, said he would support the proposed legislation.\n\"I would also be supportive of a total ban, as Florida and Utah have done to date,\" he added.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on new legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of Hart's proposed legislation can be found here.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on State Government meeting is scheduled for Nov. 13 at 3 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — A proposed House bill would seek to make housing more accessible for some renters who have been named in dismissed eviction cases.\nRep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, told the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary on Thursday that she plans to refile House Bill 534 from the 2025 legislative session in 2026.\nDismissed evictions would be automatically sealed and would not appear on a renter's record under the proposed legislation. The bill would also create a process for expunging the names of children from eviction records.\n\"This bill is important as it increases the ability for working Kentuckians to have access to safe, affordable housing, while explicitly maintaining the property rights of the landlord,\" Witten said. \"This bill makes no change to the eviction collection or damage claims property owners may have. It also enhances access in rental markets by ensuring the records used are actually accurate.\"\nWitten said the legislation is the result of the Kentucky Housing Task Force.\n\"For the past two years, we've worked really hard to try to identify state-level solutions to Kentucky's housing crisis,\" she said. \"While most of the solutions that we have identified address the housing on the supply side, there are other solutions that we have identified that can help eliminate unnecessary road blocks for Kentuckians to have access to housing, especially affordable housing.\"\nGeorge Eklund, director of education and advocacy for the Coalition for the Homeless – Louisville, told the committee Kentucky's main driver of eviction is the state's lack of housing. He said Kentucky is short around 210,000 units.\nIf a landlord decides to sell a property and requires the tenant to leave the property, sometimes the tenant has nowhere else to go.\n\"Because of our tight rental market, (the tenant) can't find a place to move to, and so the landlord is left with one option and that is to file an eviction,\" Eklund said.\nInability to pay is another main cause for eviction.\n\"Six out of every 10 low-income Kentuckians are already spending more than 50% of their wages on rent,\" Eklund said.\nOne small financial disaster, like an unexpected expense or a missed paycheck due to illness, can set tenants back months on rent, he added.\nEklund said statistics show 60% of renters resolve their eviction notice and have the case dismissed. Kentucky Administrative Office of the Courts data shows 110 out of Kentucky's 120 counties have fewer than 16 dismissed evictions a month.\nEklund said he and Witten have been working with the county court clerks to make sure the bill would be easy to implement.\n\"Luckily for us is that (the legislature) has created an automatic expungement process for dismissed criminal actions, so this is hopefully something that we could emulate as we put this into action,\" Eklund said.\nWitten said she wanted to reiterate to the committee that her proposed bill would maintain a landlord's right to screen tenants based on legal criteria, like proof of income or credit checks.\n\"They can still file evictions,\" Witten said. \"They can still collect unpaid rent, and they can still pursue legal claims or seek charges for property damage.\"\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, said he did have reservations about the legislation at first. As a landlord, he wants to know if a tenant was kicked out for nonpayment. He also wants to ensure landlords could still seek out missed payments and reimbursement for damages if needed.\nWitten said the legislation would not prevent a landlord from seeking a small claims action or sending debt off to collections.\nNemes said he is in support of removing dismissed evictions from someone's record in the event they fall on hard times, are unable to pay but then are able to resolve the issue.\nRep. Stephanie Dietz, R-Edgewood, and Rep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, were co-sponsors of Witten's bill this year.\nDietz said the legislation would help single parents struggling financially due to a missed child support or spousal support payment.\n\"I think this will help some of those single parents, so they're not living in a hotel, paying a weekly amount when they could be getting a rental and putting their family in a home,\" she said, adding she looks forward to being a primary co-sponsor of the legislation again in 2026.\nKulkarni said the bill addresses a \"very real, tangible\" barrier to housing and proposes an easy solution.\n\"This is, just to my mind, very low-hanging fruit, and it would help a lot of families avoid being homeless,\" she said.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of HB 534 can be found here.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Nov. 6.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Tourism, Small Business and Information Technology on Thursday received an overview from stakeholders about the status of Kentucky's tourism industry.\nHank Phillips, president and chief executive officer of the Frankfort-based Kentucky Travel Industry Association, said the state of tourism in Kentucky is very strong.\n\"When we talk about the strength of tourism, the way we define that is in terms of the benefits that tourism provides to the people of Kentucky and the communities of Kentucky. Examples of that: over $14 billion in economic impact from tourism, the support of nearly 100,000 jobs by tourism and the contribution of a billion dollars in local and state tax revenue,\" he said.\nThe quality of life is another important facet of tourism. The experiences provided for tourists also benefit Kentuckians, he said.\n\"That's a huge consideration by businesses in decisions to relocate to Kentucky and by families considering moving to Kentucky and working here,\" he said.\nPrakash T. Maggan, an executive with Lexington-based Rainmaker Hospitality, also testified and said the company operates 24 hotels in Kentucky and four in Ohio.\n\"While our industry came back from COVID much more quickly and much more strongly than anybody would have ever anticipated, we are now seeing a lot of headwinds in our industry,\" he said.\nMaggan said the state transient tax and ensuing advertising it funds are vital to the tourism industry.\n\"And we want to make sure that that funding continues to support our local tourism offices. We need to make sure that they have all of the resources necessary to show off the attractions and natural resources in our state,\" he said.\nLori Murphy-Tatum, tourism director for the City of Richmond, said the 1% funds are vital for the state's department of tourism. She added that some people associated with Airbnb short-term rentals are not paying the local transient tax.\n\"We are funded through transient tax. So, we get that from our hoteliers, from our bed and breakfasts and our short-term rentals,\" she said.\nRep. Shane Baker, R-Somerset, asked if people are still coming to Kentucky but not staying in hotels.\nMaggan said officials have seen a slowdown this year.\n\"We just want to make sure that, as the economic climate gets tougher for everybody, we're continuing as best in our industry and giving us the best possible chance to come out with a recovery on the other end because, as all cycles go, we will have a rising tide again,\" he said.\nRep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington, asked about the role artificial intelligence is starting to play in tourism.\n\"One of the things with AI, as you know, it is combing the internet for every bit of information that it can find. And that's why it's so important on the back end, on your local tourism offices and even with the state,\" Murphy-Tatum said. \"We're spending a lot more time going into our websites, going into Google and fact checking everything that we can find and make sure that's correct.\"\nSen. Matt Nunn, R-Sadieville, asked if local tourism offices could have more discretion about what type of projects they can fund. He pointed to a volunteer rescue service in Red River Gorge.\n\"I can't help but think that the local tourism office might be interested in funding some of those needs because likely a lot of those people that get rescued by that service are tourists there rock climbing,\" he said.\nMurphy-Tatum said those who serve on commission boards by state law decide how the money is spent, and attracting people to Kentucky is paramount.\nRep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, asked how important the bourbon industry in Kentucky is now and does the state need to diversify.\nPhillips said that from a tourism perspective, bourbon is huge, but it's not the only \"pillar.\" He also listed the outdoors, horses, music, art and food.\n\"In terms of what's going on right now with the bourbon industry, I think it's important for all of us to understand that the good days of bourbon, first they aren't over, and the main thing I want to point out is they weren't a fluke. It's not a fad. The bourbon industry is a signature industry of Kentucky is solid. It's a solid foundation,\" Phillips said.\nFRANKFORT — Sports wagering is a relatively new pastime in Kentucky. The practice joined pari-mutuel wagering as a legal betting activity in the commonwealth in 2023.\nOn Thursday, representatives from the Kentucky Horse Racing and Gaming Corporation told the Interim Joint Committee on Licensing, Occupations and Administrative Regulations that Kentuckians have wagered nearly $5 billion in the last two years.\n\"Of the $5 billion wagered, $4.4 billion was won back by Kentucky players, meaning nearly $9 out of every $10 wagered has returned to a player in the form of winnings,\" Hannah Simms, the corporation's director of sports wagering, said.\nSports wagering revenue supports the state's public pension system and problem gambling assistance account, Simms added.\nIn the last two years, $73 million in sports wagering revenue has gone to the public pension system, and $2 million has been added to the problem gambling assistance account.\nSince 2023, sports wagering has expanded to 13 retail facilities across 11 counties, Simms said. Additionally, 933 occupational licenses have been issued.\n\"These licenses are the individuals and companies who make up the sports wagering workforce in Kentucky and are helping ensure a responsible and accountable industry statewide,\" Simms said.\nMelissa Combs-Wright joined Simms in giving the committee an update on pari-mutuel wagering.\nCombs-Wright, who serves as the director of pari-mutuel wagering for the corporation, said more than $11 billion has been wagered through track betting, simulcasting, advanced deposit wagering and historical horse racing this year.\nTax revenue is then deposited to the general fund, equine development funds or equine industry programs.\n\"Pari-mutuel wagering continues to be a powerful driver of Kentucky's economy and a cornerstone of its equine legacy,\" Combs-Wright said.\nAlthough pari-mutuel and sports wagering revenue is distributed among numerous funds, House Minority Caucus Chair Al Gentry, D-Louisville, said he would like to see local governments benefit more from the practice.\n\"It's the biggest flaw in our gaming model today in Kentucky, and it's something that we have to look at, (but) not from a tax raising standpoint,\" Gentry said. \"There are social costs involved with gaming. I've always been a gaming advocate, but a lot of those costs fall upon the local governments where these things are housed.\"\nIn addition to wagering, the Office of Charitable gaming falls under the Kentucky Horse Racing and Gaming Corporation.\nRep. Tom Smith, R-Corbin, said he's noticing the formation of poker and card clubs. He asked Jamie Eads, who serves as the corporation's president and CEO, if the card clubs are obtaining a charitable gaming license like a bingo license.\n\"I see (a card club) every morning when I pass through my district,\" Smith said. \"They claim since they don't cut the pot, that they take an hourly rent on the seat, that that makes it legal.\"\nEads said she is aware of the card clubs, but charitable gaming has not issued any licenses to poker rooms.\nCommittee co-chair Rep. Matthew Koch, R-Paris, thanked the corporation for their efforts in making the entire horse racing industry successful.\n\"Kentucky has always been the horse racing capital of the world, and now we're absolutely walking the walk,\" Koch said.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee Licensing, Occupations and Administrative Regulations is scheduled to meet at 11 a.m. on Oct. 23.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Kentucky Housing Task Force 2025 on Monday received an update from advocates of modernizing the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.\nRep. Steve Bratcher, R-Elizabethtown, said home ownership is one of the fastest ways to wealth and stability for Kentuckians and Americans. He testified with Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Frankfort-based Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky and Scott McReynolds, executive director of the Hazard-based Housing Development Alliance.\n\"Affordable housing is very challenging in our area as well as statewide. So, we're here today to talk about House Bill 588 – which was filed last session – which helps with the Affordable Housing Trust Fund put some more money in that area so we can allow people to buy homes,\" Bratcher said.\nBush said the fund was established by the General Assembly in 1992. It supports housing for Kentuckians who are living below 60% of the area median income. For one person, that amounts to about $35,000, she said. For a family of four, it's around $50,000.\nBush said the fund is flexible and covers single family home construction, emergency repairs to preserve existing homes and rental development for duplexes and apartments.\nIn 2007, the General Assembly adopted a permanent funding source through real estate transfers. The trust fund receives money through a $6 transaction fee per deed transfer and $6 per mortgage recording fee. Bush said there is no recurring appropriation from the biennial budget, and over the last three years, the fees have only generated $3-4 million annually.\n\"And what we've seen as the housing market inventory has tightened, receipts have steadily declined, from a high of $5.8 million,\" Bush said.\nMcReynolds said the Housing Development Alliance serves residents of Perry, Knott, Leslie and Breathitt counties, and the demand for its services is high.\"The future is even scarier for us. Even if we could wave a magic wand and plug the housing supply gap today, we'd have to continue to build 360 houses a year until 2029 in order to meet the expected supply gap,\" he said.\nMcReynolds said the trust fund has proven to be a critical piece of funding for many reasons. He said the funding is flexible, not burdened by federal regulations and it can provide the local match that's required for federal projects.\n\"The trust fund is a Kentucky program controlled by Kentuckians for Kentucky,\" he said.\nBratcher said everyone agrees there's a housing shortage, and he said the trust fund can play an important role to improve the situation.\n\"This is one option of many that we could use to try to fix this housing shortage and to get people that are hard-working Kentuckians into affordable housing,\" he said.\nRep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, said he's a realtor and has worked in housing development for approximately 15 years. He asked if states where indexing or one-time adjustments have been enacted received complaints from industry stakeholders or others regarding affordability.\nBush said she was not aware of complaints, but said she's not in the other states.\n\"I will say with Ohio, they are both capturing the fees the way we are in Kentucky, but they're also appropriating money through their general fund. It is like a combination of both,\" she said.\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, asked about who decides where the funds go. He said Oldham and Shelby counties haven't received any funding.\nBush said there may be some counties where there isn't a Habitat for Humanity or someone with the capacity or interest in developing in that county.\n\"As someone who runs a statewide organization, I want to see these resources deployed statewide as well. I think Kentucky Housing Corp. in receiving these applications has to make tough decisions around how they send a limited pool of money,\" she said.\nNemes said he wants to make sure the money will be distributed to all places.\nSen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, asked about smaller homes.\n\"Do you all see yourself adapting to small homes and stretching those dollars further,\" he asked.\nMcReynolds said his organization is starting a project dubbed, \"the not so tiny home\" that would produce one-bedroom houses that are approximately 600 square feet for people who are flood survivors and have very limited income.\nLawmakers can't act on legislation until the 2026 Regular Session begins in January or if the governor calls a special session.\nThe next task force meeting is scheduled for Oct. 20 at 1 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — A Kentucky lawmaker and other stakeholders are asking the Kentucky General Assembly to consider making a state law that would mirror an existing federal ban on machine gun conversion devices.\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, said during the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary's meeting Thursday that he's planning to file legislation next year. The devices are often known as \"auto sears.\"\n\"It does not make anything unlawful that isn't currently unlawful,\" Nemes said. \"I cannot possess an auto sear today. It violates federal law. That does not change.\"\nMachine gun conversion devices are made of metal or plastic and can easily be attached to the back of a pistol to turn a semiautomatic device into a fully automatic weapon, Louisville Metro Police Department Chief Paul Humphrey said. The devices are easily made by 3D printers.\nHumphrey said LMPD has seen the device used in crime more frequently in the last few years, with 80 seized in Jefferson County last year.\n\"We're not talking about something that helps with accuracy or that helps with self-defense,\" he said. \"We're talking about something that actually makes the weapon far less accurate and far more dangerous to everyone around.\"\nWhile LMPD does report the use of the devices to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, Humphrey said the agency doesn't have the manpower to prosecute every reported case.\nSince there is no law prohibiting the devices at the state level, Humphrey said local law enforcement and prosecutors cannot fill the gap on their own.\n\"We understand the impact of the violent crimes that are going on on our streets and in our neighborhoods, and this is exacerbated greatly by this problem,\" Humphrey said. \"And what (the legislation would do) is it turns the ability for us – the local police officer, the local prosecutors – to be able to take some kind of action on these that we currently cannot take.\"\nReviewing a draft of the potential legislation, committee co-chair Rep. Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, asked Nemes if the class C felony charge is in-line with federal law as well.\nNemes said he thinks the proposed penalty is the same as the federal law, noting that class C felonies carry a penalty of five to 10 years.\nAfter asking a few questions about the bill's language and the intent, Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, said he has constitutional concerns due to pending litigation in federal court.\nNemes said if a federal court order finds the law to be unconstitutional, it would no longer be enforceable.\n\"I think they're lawful,\" Nemes added. \"…. I think the courts will hold that's a constitutional restriction, and I think we should fall in line.\"\nRoberts said he would prefer the legislature focus on expanding the right to self-defense rather than impose more restrictions.\nRep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, said he is supportive of the Second Amendment and the proposed legislation. He said the conversion devices also pose a risk to law enforcement.\n\"You guys in law enforcement have to have some type of protection there,\" Blanton said. \"These are the types of things that people are using more for an offensive stance than defensive stance.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of Bill Request 8 can be found here.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting is scheduled to meet at 11 a.m. on Oct. 16.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services received an update Tuesday from the director of the University of Kentucky Cannabis Center.\nIn 2022, House Bill 604 established the cannabis center with a $2 million appropriation for a multitude of projects.\nShanna Babalonis, director of the center in Lexington, testified about some of the projects that staff members have been undertaking. She also offered information about future plans.\nBabalonis said the center is conducting, or hoping to conduct, three projects funded through the National Institutes of Health.\nOne of them – for $2.8 million – determines how cannabis may alter opioid withdrawal, reward and safety.\n\"We enrolled patients into the UK hospital and give them cannabis under controlled conditions and look at how cannabis alters that opioid withdrawal profile,\" she said.\nBabalonis said an important goal of the project is to examine safety to learn if cannabis alters opioid-induced respiratory depression.\nA second $2.87 million NIH grant would look at how cannabis may alter the drive to take opioids in people with opioid use disorder. Babalonis said a decision on this funding is expected soon.\nBabalonis said the center also recruited a new faculty member who brought along a grant with her.\nThe third NIH grant for $720,000 determines how repeated cannabidiol (CBD) doses modify tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) abuse potential and pain relief, she said.\nThe center has two additional grants now under review. One would determine how cannabis with THC and CBD interaction effects change abuse potential and find out if the addition of CBD helps decrease the abuse potential of concentrates or dabs.\nThe second grant would look at the effects of a minor cannabinoid compound – one that does not get people high – on pain outcomes, anti-nausea and abuse potential, Babalonis said.\nBabalonis also discussed a clinical trial on patients with active cancer and several completed projects, which include a trial on the interaction of inhaled cannabis and intranasal opioids, a trial on the impact of cannabis on simulated driving performance, and analytical chemistry projects to test products for cannabinoid content and contamination.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, asked Babalonis about overdoses in children.\n\"Is there any effort going on nationwide to package this less attractively for children, and is there a way to address that,\" she asked.\nBabalonis indicated that nothing substantial is occurring nationwide.\n\"We're actually putting things out there that look like candy and taste like candy. And for a kid to get their hand in a candy jar. You know, it seems nonsensical to me if we're going to use this as medicinal, to make it look like candy,\" Berg said.\nRep. Rebecca Raymer, R-Morgantown, said there is a difference between natural cannabis and synthetic cannabis. She expressed concern about children who become ill after ingesting substances such as Delta-8.\n\"I don't think everybody understands the difference, and I would be interested in getting some more information on the symptoms they were seeing when these kids came in, if it was just the central nervous system, depression, or if there were other things,\" she said. \"We know there's dangers with the solvents that they're using to extract these higher levels of THC.\"\nSen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, said those at the center have a tough job.\n\"Your job is to be objective in spite of all the anecdotal beliefs that people have,\" he said.\nRep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, asked Babalonis about the study of cannabis and PTSD. Willner said the center's employees have been able to accomplish many things in a short amount of time.\n\"I know that there's not been a lot of study about cannabis and PTSD. But, the National Institutes of Health, the Veterans Administration have both declared it contraindicated for that condition,\" Willner said.\nBabalonis said patients who are \"fragile\" should not be administered high doses of THC, and data collected to date are inconclusive and placebo-like. However, she said staff at the center could examine this issue if the legislature requests it.\nFRANKFORT — Nearly a year ago, a vehicle traveling down I-64 in Bath County struck and killed Troy Caldwell, a tow truck operator from Morehead, while he was working.\nNow, Rep. Richard White, R-Morehead, and Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, hope Troy's Law – or Bill Request 33 – will prevent the death of more tow truck operators in the state.\nWhite and Flannery presented the proposed bill for the 2026 legislative session during Tuesday's Interim Joint Committee on Transportation meeting.\n\"This legislation will allow wreckers to operate blue lights while stationary and actively removing a vehicle or debris from the highway,\" White said. \"This is a limited, common-sense step that increases visibility and prompts drivers to slow down and move over.\"\nBlue emergency lights are typically reserved for law enforcement vehicles. White said the bill would not create confusion with law enforcement.\n\"It is narrowly written to allow blue lights only when the truck is stopped, not while driving or towing,\" White added.\nBR 33 is similar to House Bill 115, which was filed by White, Flannery and several co-sponsors during this year's legislative session. The bill did not advance past the committee assignment phase of the legislative process.\nIf passed in 2026, Kentucky would not be the first state to allow blue lights on tow trucks, White said. Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and others have implemented similar legislation.\n\"Troy's Law is about saving the lives of our brave tow truck operators,\" White said. \"It is about protecting the men and women who come to our rescue when we need them the most and ensuring that they get to go home safely.\"\nFlannery said BR 33 is about worker safety.\n\"People in the towing business have a very important job, but often a very dangerous job,\" Flannery said.\nFlannery's constituent, Bubba Johnson, a tow truck company owner and Caldwell's friend, testified alongside the representatives on Tuesday.\nJohnson told the committee that Kentucky's law requiring motorists to slow down and move over for emergency vehicles is helpful, but not enough.\n\"Adding the blue lights to the rear of these tow trucks would give us one more layer of protection,\" Johnson said.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, asked White and Flannery what the Kentucky State Police's position is on the bill.\nWhite said that KSP was not in favor of the bill during the 2025 legislative session.\n\"I think their thinking is it interferes with their usage of their blue lights,\" he added.\nSen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, asked if the sponsors have considered if other colors of lights, like red, may be used to alert motorists instead of blue to avoid confusion with law enforcement.\nJohnson said tow trucks can currently be equipped with red and yellow lights.\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said the committee received a letter of opposition prior to the meeting concerning the proposed bill. She said the letter raised the issue of towing fraud and cited concerns that certain tow truck drivers who listen to police scanners and arrive first on the scene may be incorrectly associated with law enforcement.\n\"Do we know how prevalent that issue is in our state or nationwide?\" Roarx asked.\nFlannery said he did not find the concerns in the letter to be \"persuasive.\"\n\"I'm sure as in any profession there are bad actors and people that do things that they ought not do,\" he added. \"I don't really know how putting a different color of lights on top of a tow truck is going to cause more fraud.\"\nRep. David Hale, R-Wellington, said he was a cosponsor of last year's House Bill 115, and he still supports the legislation. He urged the committee to carefully consider the issue.\n\"I think it is definitely a life-saving piece of legislation that we need to move forward with,\" he said.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of White and Flannery's proposed bill can be found here.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Transportation meeting is scheduled to meet at 1 p.m. on Oct. 14.\nFRANKFORT — The state Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board heard about a proposal Tuesday that would extend coverage to help Kentucky families offset costs of care at assisted living facilities.\nRep. Deanna Gordon, R-Richmond, said she is working on legislation related to that issue in advance of the next legislative session, which begins in January.\n\"This bill draft would extend Medicaid coverage to assisted living services. For reference, Kentucky is only one of three states that do not offer Medicaid coverage for assisted living services. Right now, Medicaid will only cover the costs of living in a skilled nursing facility,\" she said.\nGordon said unless a patient has the funds to pay for these services out-of-pocket or a loved one can care for them full-time, a nursing home is often the only option. She also pointed to family members who leave their jobs to care for their loved ones full-time.\n\"This legislation seeks to close a huge gap in our state's long-term care system by ensuring Medicaid patients have access to assisted living services,\" she said.\nThis week marks National Assisted Living Week, and Gordon said that with an aging population and increasing economic pressures on families, Kentucky must offer more affordable alternatives to a nursing home placement. Assisted living facilities help residents with daily living tasks, personal care, medication management and many more while preserving the patients' independence.\n\"Assisted living is a cost-effective, long-term care model that provides care for patients who do not require full, medicalized, institutional, structured care such as a nursing home,\" she said.\nCurrently, the average monthly cost of a private room in a skilled nursing facility is between $12,000 and $14,000. By comparison, assisted living services cost an average of around $3,400 per month, Gordon said.\n\"By allowing Medicaid to cover assisted living, Kentucky could provide the appropriate level of long-term care for patients while easing the strain on the state budget and potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars annually in Medicaid spending,\" she said.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said the topic of assisted living facilities is interesting and attention on the issue is \"extraordinarily needed.\"\n\"Right now, we don't have any waivers for assisted living, but we are apparently willing as a state to pay family members to be caregivers for people that otherwise really should be in the assisted living facility. Is that correct and would this have any impact on that,\" she asked Gordon.\nGordon said she doesn't know if the state needs to pay family members to be caregivers, but at the same time, it would allow the services to be provided in homes or the most appropriate environment. She said details will continue to be considered before the legislative session begins.\nBerg said it's possible that federal dollars could be used instead. She said she knows of people who would do well in assisted living and are being cared for with state dollars by family members who should otherwise be at work.\nBoard Co-Chair Rep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, said a waiver for patient-directed payments exists now.\n\"We do have that in there, and you have to qualify in order to be in a caregiver if you're associated or if you're a relative or family member of that particular person who needs it. There is something like that, but this could be included in that or surround that to a certain degree,\" he said.\nRep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, asked about in-home care for those who do not have caregivers.\n\"If someone wanted to stay at their home – a lot of people do – and there are no caregivers, could they just call nursing care to come once a day or a nursing assistant or anything like that,\" she asked. \"Maybe come and maybe make a meal, and they're getting a shower, medications, and that kind of thing.\"\nGordon said there are different levels of waivers, and her legislation is open-ended now.\n\"I think the goal is just to allow patients to age in place and to get the most appropriate care without necessarily having to go into a skilled facility if they're not at that point,\" she said.\nFleming said that Gordon should be mindful of the possible fiscal impact of the legislation, and Gordon said savings aren't always considered.\n\"We are looking at ways to get some of those metrics, because that's the impact that we're wanting to have,\" she said.\nFRANKFORT — The Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary received a presentation from a national policy group Friday about how Kentucky fares on tackling domestic violence and other justice-related issues.\nTwo experts from the Council of State Governments Justice Center, Ellen Whelan-Wuest, deputy division director of state initiatives, and David D'Amora, senior policy adviser, shared findings from a justice reinvestment initiative launched in 2023.\nThrough the initiative, state leaders partnered with the center to study domestic violence and intimate partner violence and recommend data-driven solutions.\nResearchers scoured data from the state Department of Corrections, the Kentucky State Police, the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System and Kentucky courts, among others.\nD'Amora said Kentucky faces a high prevalence of domestic violence. He said it's a major driver of violent crime in the commonwealth, contributes to recidivism and consumes significant resources.\nAccording to the presentation, about half of all adults in Kentucky experience sexual violence, physical violence or stalking in their lifetimes – about 48% of women compared to 47% of women nationally. For men in Kentucky, the number was 52% compared to 44% nationally.\nD'Amora said the analysis showed that an average of approximately 22,000 incidents of interpersonal violence occurred from 2018 to 2022, with 60% of it involving an intimate partner. The other 40% involved child or elder abuse or other types of family violence.\n\"There's been an increase in recent years in the case filings and in the temporary protective orders, but the number of granted permanent orders has declined,\" D'Amora said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, asked the presenters if they have statistics regarding the prevalence of civil domestic violence petitions or cases and companion criminal cases.\nD'Amora said he wasn't sure if the information was gathered from received data, but said he'd confer with research staff and let Storm know.\nStorm said in 2024, the general assembly passed Senate Bill 319, which is related to crime victims' compensation, and in 2025, legislators green lighted House Bill 38, which made the third offense of domestic violence a class D felony.\nHouse Minority Whip Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, thanked her colleagues for passing House Bill 38, saying it will help strengthen how re-offenses are handled.\nBurke said service of process is an important issue, and the research will help legislators take a closer look at what they're doing well and where there is room for improvement.\n\"I see that as I work in domestic violence court,\" she said. \"I know that many of the survivors that I represent come back week after week after week to preserve their orders and hope that the offender has been served. And I know that tragically in Fayette County, we just had a mass shooting perpetrated by someone who had an unserved protective order against him.\"\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, said the issues discussed during the meeting are timely because two deputy sheriffs were shot while serving a warrant related to family violence. He asked D'Amora to expand on a point from the presentation.\n\"I think you said Kentucky is one of the top three or four states that take domestic violence seriously. I want to ask you to elaborate on that and ask why do you say that,\" Nemes said.\nD'Amora said there are many factors.\n\"The amount of attention that Kentucky has paid, the bills that you have passed, the way that you do take it seriously, the impact that your victims' services folks have had in the last several years in moving this forward, the seriousness with which the certification of VIP (violence intervention program) programing and looking for evidence-based programming that happens, the tracking of it, and the fact that you haven't just said, ‘Oh, well. It's just something that just happens.' That is massively impressive that Kentucky has done that,\" D'Amora said.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Tourism, Small Business, and Information Technology lauded efforts Thursday to not only share the state's natural beauty, but also boost its economic coffers through adventure tourism.\nThe lawmakers heard testimony from Erik Hubbard, executive director of Backroads of Appalachia; David Cole of King of the Hammers/Ultra4 Racing; and Fred Bramblett of Rides4Fun/Grand National Cross Country.\nThe trio said that motorsports and the related tourism dollars are bolstering Kentucky's economic growth. They presented findings from an economic data report, which showed a $50.5 million impact from motorsports in the commonwealth.\nHubbard said other states such as Colorado and Utah are drawing people through motor tourism, and Kentucky should continue to do likewise.\n\"We have coal mine towns, they have mining towns or mineral towns, but they have converted it into a reason for people to come and spend their hard-earned dollars. That's really our mission now is the switching,\" he said. \"We have a pretty good grasp on the highway presentations with the motorcycle tourism and the car groups and all that and to really focus into what we call adventure tourism.\"\nHubbard said the group works with people in recovery from substance use and exposes young people to motorsports and possible career paths in the industry.\nThe topic of motorsports is not new to many of the legislators, as Senate Bill 63 from the 2025 legislative session became law in March. Sen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, was the lead sponsor of the legislation.\nHubbard said the bill established protocols around motorsports and created new opportunities for utility terrain vehicles and special purpose vehicles.\n\"To be on a highway they have to have the insurance,\" he said. \"They have to have turn signals, they have to have their seatbelt, they have to either have a windshield or goggles on, and it's a safety protocol.\"\nSen. Scott Madon, R-Pineville, said 300-600 vehicles come through his hometown every weekend to access the trails. \"It's been happening for many years since Erik has taken on this Backroads of Appalachia as a full-time job instead of a part-time job.\"\nMadon said adventure tourism has been popular in Eastern Kentucky, but he expects it will grow in other parts of the state. Last year, a race in Pineville brought in more than 100 cars, representing 32 different states.\nNot long after the Pineville race, Madon said bikers with 300 high-end BMW motorcycles came to the area.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, said as a youth mentor, getting children involved in motorsports could give them a positive outlet. He said it's possible there could be a partnership between schools in Louisville and motorsports advocates.\n\"I think this might be a huge opportunity for partnerships as we move forward, but the economic impact – I think it's got to be promoted. So right now, we're putting a whole lot of money into strategically messaging Kentucky. We're trying to draw people in for their tourism dollars and make sure they're spent here,\" Yates said.\nRep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, said she is excited about possibilities involving motorsports.\n\"I just want to congratulate you. This is amazing. I'm from Louisville. This is all new to me, but wow,\" she said.\nRep. Bill Wesley, R-Ravenna, highlighted a Christian men's fellowship event in Eastern Kentucky that includes ATV riding. Wesley said such events can help keep tourism dollars in Kentucky.\n\"What this is doing, this is cutting off that traffic flow, hoping to catch all the Louisville folks from going down to Tennessee and keeping them here in Kentucky. So, we're trying to draw attraction over there. We just appreciate the work you're doing,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky lawmakers on Wednesday heard about efforts to research an alternative treatment method that advocates say could help scores of people who suffer from substance use disorder.\nThe Interim Joint Committee on Health Services heard from Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville; Dr. Jean Loftus, ambassador for Americans for Ibogaine; and Jessica Blackburn Allen, a volunteer with Americans for Ibogaine who has been administered the compound during drug treatment.\nDouglas said he is working on legislation for the 2026 Regular Session that would create a pathway to study the effectiveness of ibogaine as a treatment option. He described the substance as a naturally occurring compound – found in root bark in central west Africa – that has been used in other parts of the world for a long time.\nHe also noted that Kentucky's 2024 overdose fatality report found that around 1,410 Kentuckians died of drug overdoses that year and that, according to other research, about 85% of individuals who complete a traditional rehabilitation program will relapse within a year.\n\"I'm really here today to introduce a different clinical model. We've been dealing with the same clinical model over and over for decades,\" he said. \"It's not working. We simply have got to stop trading one addictive compound for another addictive compound. We've got to stop it.\"\nLoftus said the human and economic costs of addiction are high, and that ibogaine has the potential to help with co-occurring disorders.\n\"Ibogaine treats treatment-resistant depression, and by that, I mean depression that has failed all medication, all therapy, everything,\" she said. \"These conditions may seem very different, but they overlap in some important ways. Those who suffer from them are often impaired functionally. They have difficulty holding a job. They utilize a staggering amount of social services.\"\nIbogaine is not a cure for addiction, but it interrupts acute withdrawal, post addiction withdrawal syndrome and craving so that the addicted person can then remain abstinent through support, Loftus said.\n\"Looking at costs, and again taking the case of addiction, ibogaine costs about one-eighth that of traditional treatment per person. And these numbers are for treatment attempts per person, not for treatment successes. So just because you spend $700,000 on traditional treatment for someone with addiction does not mean that it worked,\" she said.\nAllen, a licensed social worker from Eastern Kentucky, said her experience with substance use began at the age of 17 and escalated into a daily oxycodone or heroin habit by the age of 19. She said she tried the very best traditional treatments available, making five to six attempts over five years.\nOn Christmas Eve 2008, Allen took her last oxycodone and boarded a plane bound for Mexico, where she underwent treatment with ibogaine. She said she experienced a vision of herself lying in a casket while her mother wept, allowing her to feel the pain her addiction was causing others.\nAllen said she woke up the next morning with no withdrawal symptoms or drug cravings and felt like an enormous burden had been lifted.\n\"My guilt, shame and depression that I came with were completely gone,\" she said. \"I felt overwhelmingly grateful and experienced joy from simply being alive. Within 24 hours, my life was transformed. The benefits from my first ibogaine experience have remained with me to this day.\"\nIbogaine has not received approval from the Food and Drug Administration and remains classified as a Schedule 1 drug on the federal level. Schedule 1 drugs are considered likely addictive with no real medical benefits.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, noted that ibogaine remains an illegal substance and asked Douglas what the proposed bill would involve.\nDouglas compared the measure to the general assembly's recent work on medical marijuana and said it would clear a pathway to initiate research on ibogaine. He mentioned the possible formation of a legislative consortium to fund ibogaine studies and ultimately seek to reclassify the compound on the federal drug schedule.\nRep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, asked about current research on ibogaine.\n\"What has been done so far on ibogaine? Because what I was finding is that it's a psychedelic, a psychoactive drug. It may occur naturally, but it seems to cause cardiotoxicity, psychosis, neurotoxicity. So where is the urgency to study this when we do have medications? We do have therapies to help people who are struggling with addiction,\" she said.\nLofus said the current therapies are \"woefully inadequate.\"\n\"They fail people time and time again so we have therapies but they don't work very well. We have excellent evidence that ibogaine works. We have anecdotal reports, person after person saying I tried everything, so we do need ibogaine to address that,\" she said.\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, expressed gratitude for the legislation that could help people such as Allen, who have been destitute. He said it's a chance that needs to be taken.\nThe next committee meeting is scheduled for Sept. 16 at 3 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — A proposal for a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to convicted felons in Kentucky may be considered during the 2026 legislative session.\nSen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, and Sen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, presented different ideas about the concept to the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government and discussed why the legislature should take up the issue.\nDuring a committee meeting on Tuesday, Higdon noted that, if not for COVID, he believes the proposal would have already been adopted in 2020.\n\"We passed my bill out of the Senate,\" Higdon said. \"It went to the House; I believe it would have passed, but we cut the session short because of COVID, and it did not pass.\"\nHerron said she worked on restoring voting rights as an advocate and pledged to continue that work as an elected official. She added that, if the proposal wins approval, some felons would still spend a long time without the right to vote.\n\"If somebody is convicted of something like a murder, they do 15 to 20 plus years, they get out and they still have to be on probation. This would say that the person would have to get off probation to be able to vote. So you're still looking at another 5 to 15 years before that person would be able to vote,\" she said.\nCurrently in Kentucky, non-violent felons who have satisfied their term of supervised release and/or sentence of incarceration have the right to vote through an executive order signed in 2019. Herron said the nature of this has the potential to create some complexities going forward.\n\"I do know an individual who at 19 was convicted of a felony,\" she said. \"They did two years and 13 on probation. They finished that 13 years without any other offenses committed, and they were not able to vote until the executive order that the governor did. If it went away, that person would not be able to vote.\"\nRep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, had a question regarding the scope of the proposal and what rights it was seeking to restore.\n\"Is your all's constitutional amendment just pertaining to voting rights, or is it pertaining to other rights as well,\" Hart asked.\n\"This constitutional amendment is for restoration of voting rights.\" Higdon answered. \"That is our goal. It does not allow you to run for office.\"\nSen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, asked Herron whether a constitutional amendment was the best way to restore felons' voting rights.\n\"Could you achieve the same thing through automatic expungement or something of that nature,\" Elkins asked.\n\"That is a great question,\" Herron responded. \"I want to be very clear. Expungement and voting rights are two different things. Voting rights are in the constitution and expungement is not. They are two different processes that do two different things.\"\nRep. George Brown Jr., D-Lexington, said it's only fair that people who have completed their sentence and paid restitution be allowed to vote.\n\"We are one of three states that do not do that, so I think it's time,\" he said. \"It's timely, and it's something that needs to be done of behalf of the citizens of the commonwealth.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6. For more information, visit legislature.ky.gov.\nFRANKFORT — The Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue received some welcome news during its August meeting on Wednesday.\nThe state's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payment error rate is currently at 3.7% for 2025. The rate will need to remain below 6% for the federal government to continue covering 100% of the SNAP benefits cost going into the 2028 federal fiscal year.\nThe new policy is the result of House Resolution 1 – or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act – which the U.S. Congress passed earlier this summer.\nLesa Dennis, who serves as the commissioner for the Kentucky Department of Community Based Services, said the coverage rate for the 2028 federal fiscal year will be based on the 2025 or 2026 payment error rate.\n\"A payment error occurs when a household receives more or less than the correct benefit amount set at the $58 tolerance level,\" Dennis said.\nSNAP payment errors are identified through a quality control process then the error is analyzed to identify opportunities to prevent the error from being repeated, she added.\nIf the current error rate rises above 6%, Kentucky could be on the hook for up to a maximum of 15% of the benefit costs. Dennis said the cost sharing requirement rates are on a scale.\nAccording to her presentation, if the error rate rises above 6% but stays below 8%, the state's cost sharing requirement would be 5%, or an estimated $62.6 million, for example. An error rate of 10% or more would lead to a 15% cost sharing requirement of an estimated $187.8 million.\nBy 2029, the cost sharing rate will be based on the error rate from three years prior, Dennis said.\nCommittee co-chair Sen. Christian McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, asked Dennis what the department plans to do to keep the payment error rate below 6%.\nDennis said the department was examining its quality control process and other payment data prior to HR 1.\n\"How do we use that data? How do we use that to enhance practice and policy? (We're looking) at our system. Where is our opportunity for some system changes and enhancements?\" Dennis said. \"And also looking at how we can improve practice overall.\"\nThe state's payment error rate has already improved compared to 2023's error rate of 7.2%, Dennis said. The national average at that time was nearly 12%.\nHR 1 is also bringing changes to the Medicaid system. Rep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, was curious about the overlap between SNAP recipients and Medicaid recipients.\n\"Are all SNAP recipients, Medicaid recipients? And not all Medicaid recipients are SNAP recipients?\" he asked.\nDennis said not everyone is enrolled in both.\n\"When an individual applies for SNAP, they are asked about Medicaid as well, but not everyone applies for Medicaid. And not everyone who's receiving Medicaid receives SNAP,\" she added.\nRep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, who also co-chairs the committee, encouraged Dennis and the cabinet to ask for the legislature's help if needed.\n\"We're all rooting for you to pull that error rate down and keep it down\" Petrie said. \"It looks like it's doing good. When you look at it at the historical, and also from the federal viewpoint, Kentucky is not a bad outlier of a higher error rate, historically. This is something that is within our control to address and keep it below that 6%, which helps everybody.\"\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue Committee is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Sept. 17.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Education heard from Kentucky's auditor of public accounts Monday about performance data from a recent Kentucky Department of Education review\nThe 556-page report stems from a measure adopted in the 2024 legislative session. It called for a full fiscal controls and operational performance review of the KDE, spanning a four-year period from 2020 through 2024.\nAuditor Allison Ball said the report is a product of \"immense\" work. Investigators looked at department operations, fiscal information, department strategy and partnerships, state board oversight, academic standards and the model curriculum framework, interscholastic athletics, the Kentucky School for the Blind, and preschool, Ball said.\n\"It was very, very broad. It needed to be broad because the KDE is big. It does a lot. It's just very vast, and as far as anyone in the auditor's office can remember, this is the first time a comprehensive audit like this has ever been done on the KDE,\" she said.\nBall said the timing of the examination is good because the KDE is crafting a strategic plan and this will help the department's staff accomplish the planning in an effective way.\nTo complete the examination, Ball's staff conducted interviews, focus groups, surveys, school site visits, and benchmark comparisons against five peer states. Laws and regulations that impact the KDE were reviewed, and KDE leadership staff, superintendents and others offered input, Ball said.\nThrough the review, Ball said staff found the KDE lacks measurable benchmarks.\n\"And this is really, really important if you're going to increase proficiency scores. If you're going to tailor academic assessments for students, you need to have measurables. It's very common to see language like \"improve\" or \"increase.\" And those are great words, but you need to have some measurable benchmarks in order to be able to figure out OK, are you meeting the goals that you need to meet?\" she said.\nBall said the KDE could help improve the lives of students in several areas. Those include improved numeracy, additional school counselors and literacy coaches, enhanced suicide prevention efforts, efforts to ensure preschools are operating at the highest level possible, and efforts to curtail gang violence.\nThe auditor's staff also found that consistent and comprehensive reviews should be completed at school districts. Around 43% of school districts have not had a completed comprehensive on-site monitoring within the last 10 years, according to the presentation.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris, asked if the audit identified glaring discrepancies in fiscal policy or spending.\nBall said investigators identified some problems with processes, but not in relation to expenditures themselves.\n\"We didn't find glaring problems. There was one area in particular that had to do with grants, that schools had to fill out some paperwork years and years and years ago. It had not been updated for a long period of time,\" she said. \"So, we don't know for certain if they still qualify for those kinds of grants. So, there were some issues like that. We did not find big ticket, glaring problems other than the SEEK funding.\"\nBall said the software used for tracking the budget could be improved.\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said she has been working with Rep. Scott Sharp, R-Ashland, and the Engage and Empower Disability Caucus to spur resources for the Individualized Education Program (a collaborative document for special education services).\n\"Thank you for this report. I think it has definitely elevated a lot of really important needs and you've highlighted some of those, from the sexual assault prevention and awareness to our multilingual parents needing access to the special education dispute resolution forms as well as mental health,\" she said.\nRep. Emily Callaway, R-Louisville, said she would like to see much more attention given to career and technical education programs and area technology centers. She said funding is paramount.\n\"I do want to reiterate: I appreciate you drawing attention to CTE and the ATC and the fact that they are not included in the strategic plan. That is really disconcerting to me,\" she said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Scott Lewis, R-Hartford, thanked staff from the auditor's office for their presentation.\n\"That was a lot to digest, and we probably will have more questions and be in contact with you then,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Transportation had questions for the Transportation Cabinet following a state road fund update during the committee's Monday meeting.\nShaun McKiernan, the cabinet's executive director of budget and fiscal management, told the committee the state ended the 2024-25 fiscal year with a $61.6 million surplus in the road fund.\nThe motor fuels revenue total was 3.5% below the estimate, but the motor vehicle usage tax revenue performed nearly 11% stronger than predicted, McKiernan said.\n\"The bottom line is the road fund revenue was $38.5 million greater than the enacted estimate,\" McKiernan added.\nA drop in the motor fuels tax rate went into effect at the beginning of 2025, which is the main reason the revenue estimate was lower than predicted, McKiernan said.\nA surprise increase in motor vehicle tax revenue is not the only reason the road fund surplus is higher than estimated.\n\"Net spending coming in below budget added $8.3 million to the surplus,\" McKiernan said. He added that the 2024-26 biennium budget directs any road fund surplus to be allocated to the highway construction program.\nCommittee co-chair Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, said the drop in motor fuels tax revenue will be a \"big hit\" to the funding allocated for city, county and rural secondary roads. Statute currently allocates a portion of motor fuels tax revenue to the Local Assistance Road Program.\n\"I just want to emphasize why we're not blacktopping and repairing all the rural secondary roads that we should,\" Higdon said.\nHigdon also noted the reason motor vehicle usage tax revenue is up is because of inflation.\nRep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, asked McKiernan if there are other reasons why motor fuel tax revenues are down.\n\"Is fuel efficiency (and) the rise in electric vehicles … is that also a factor? Or is that a relatively minor factor?\" Lehman asked.\nMcKiernan said drivers using less motor fuel due to more fuel-efficient vehicles is a factor in the drop in revenue.\nIn addition to questions about tax revenue, a few lawmakers wanted to discuss the length of time it takes for road projects to be completed in Kentucky.\nRep. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, said she's heard complaints about how long it takes for road projects to be completed.\n\"Could you give us any update of why it's taken so long for projects to (be completed), even though the money is there, it's in the transportation plan and has been probably for several cycles?\" she asked.\nMike Hancock, deputy secretary for the Transportation Cabinet, said the cabinet works hard to complete every project.\n\"We have a tremendous load of projects in the highway plan,\" Hancock said. \"We've had conversations about funding and about how much funding there is and how we could stretch those across as many projects as we can.\"\nHancock said a lot goes into executing these projects, such as utility relocation.\n\"There's so much that's going on, and that's not always readily obvious,\" Hancock said. \"It's like the duck paddling on top of the water. You don't always see the feet churning underneath.\"\nSen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, told the committee that land acquisition delays slow down projects in his district.\n\"Could you give us an idea of sort of what percentage of the slowdown issue that might be, because I know in my district that's a significant issue?\" Douglas asked.\nHancock said right-of-way purchases are often a long, difficult process.\n\"We're anxious to acquire the property to help move the project along, but the person that's being affected has rights as well. And they quite often exercise those,\" Hancock added. \"As we work together to try to resolve those issues, sometimes that just takes longer than we would like. But at the end of the day, we're abiding by all the rules governing right-of-way acquisition.\"\nHancock said when lawmakers do hear about a project moving quickly, it's usually because the right-of-way acquisition process or the utility relocation phase moved quicker than anticipated.\nFRANKFORT — Some Kentucky lawmakers say they have concerns about an upcoming Medicaid waiver program originally intended for youth with severe disabilities.\nCommittee co-chair Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, told the Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children on Wednesday that he believes the upcoming waiver program will not be implemented correctly.\n\"Now, there have been a lot of discussions that the waiver that has been formulated and proposed is not what the legislature asked for,\" Carroll said.\nIn the 2024-26 biennial budget, the general assembly appropriated $4.2 million in state funds and $10.5 million in federal funds to develop a new Home and Community Based Services 1915(c) waiver, which is now known as the Community Health for Improved Lives and Development (CHILD) Waiver, Carroll said.\n\"It was meant to serve children who were basically on the Michelle P. Waiver and to move those kids to the CHILD Waiver to free up waiver slots for adults,\" Carroll added.\nCarroll told the committee it's a \"hard conversation to have\" because the alternate program – proposed by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services – will still be serving a population of children in serious need of specialized care.\nDr. Leslie Hoffman, the deputy commissioner for the state Department of Medicaid Services, said the cabinet is asking the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to approve a plan to use the CHILD Waiver for children ages 0 to 21 with significant behavioral health or developmental needs.\nOfficials are focusing on children and youth with the most complex needs, \"the very acute of very acute children,\" Hoffman said. \"We are focusing on children and youth that are stepping out of acute psychiatric inpatient care such as a PRTF or an at-risk out-of-home placement due to requiring intensive behavioral health and residential supports.\"\nLesa Dennis, the commissioner for the state Department of Community Based Services, said a growing number of children need this type of service.\nIn 2023, there were 60 youth who spent more than 90 consecutive days in inpatient psychiatric care. In 2024, that number rose to 379 youth, Dennis said.\n\"The existing system of care lacks the capacity and range to support children and youth with complex needs, which has resulted in delays in discharge from inpatient psychiatric hospitals…,\" Dennis told the committee.\nDennis said these children are known to have a history of trauma and severe mental health diagnoses such as depression and psychosis. Others have substance abuse disorder. Many of these children are also in-and-out of foster care and the juvenile justice system.\nDr. Katie Marks, the commissioner for the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities, told the committee the CHILD Waiver will use a standardized, needs-based assessment to determine eligibility.\nAn individualized service plan and care coordination would be created for those who qualify for the estimated 100 available slots.\nCarroll asked the cabinet how the decision was made for the CHILD Waiver to be used for this population of children.\n\"The language in House Bill 6 was fairly clear,\" Carroll said. \"Again, these are both populations that I and many others advocate for very, very strongly. But it is clear that this waiver was meant to serve a different population.\"\nHoffman told Carroll that the cabinet is seeking to serve a high needs population and is attempting to do that with the funding and parameters provided.\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said the proposed waiver is \"undoubtedly\" addressing a need, but she is also concerned the waiver is not being applied correctly.\n\"I share with the chairman that this doesn't really get to the heart of cutting down our waiver waitlist crisis,\" Roarx said. \"We have thousands of folks that are on that waitlist, waiting for services who can't get it, families who can't go to work because they're taking care of loved ones in these situations.\"\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, asked the cabinet how the general assembly should word future legislation on the issue.\n\"Since we're thinking and heading into another budget cycle, if we were wanting to remove more children from the waiver backlog, what should the wording be in our budget document…?\" Mills said.\nMarks said the cabinet would be happy to co-create something with the legislature on that issue.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children meeting is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Aug. 27.\nFRANKFORT — Allowing residents to keep chickens as pets is becoming an important issue in towns across Kentucky. Rep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, told the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government how these \"backyard\" chickens could enhance local communities.\nDuring a committee meeting Tuesday, Doan said legislation on this issue is important because of challenges he is seeing in Northern Kentucky.\n\"There is actually some litigation right now,\" Doan said. \"Some folks had them for a number of years as emotional support chickens, believe it or not. I believe one of the people had autism, and so the city has taken some steps against those folks, and they have filed an ADA lawsuit.\"\nDoan's co-presenter, one of his constituents named Eric Bunzow, testified that having backyard chickens is very relaxing.\n\"I like to go and grab a chicken, and sit it on my lap, and sit in the backyard while the other chickens run around,\" he said.\nBunzow explained that the bill was constructed, \"to give the cities and municipalities control of what people can and can't do with their chickens, other than saying they can't have them.\"\nDoan previously filed this measure, House Bill 806, in the 2025 legislative session. The short, one-page bill defines a backyard chicken as a \"domesticated hen kept on residential property for personal egg production and educational purposes, excluding commercial farming.\"\nSen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, said that, at a city meeting he recently attended, critics of this legislation were almost universally taking about how chickens spread disease.\n\"As I sat there, I thought, ‘people have had chickens from time immemorial,' and I had read articles about what a great fertilizer chicken waste is,\" Rawlings said. He then asked how the advocates would respond to the disease criticism.\n\"If you don't have them, you wouldn't know,\" Bunzow said in response. \"As far as what they bring, it's nice eggs. You know what is coming in and what is coming out.\"\nAnother concern was raised by Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, who wanted to know about how this legislation might impact homeowner's associations and their ability to govern their communities.\n\"Can you speak to how this would affect HOAs' authority to put in regulations in their own communities?\" she asked.\n\"HOAs would still be allowed to ban backyard chickens,\" Doan answered. \"This bill would have no impact on them.\"\nWhile HOAs could still regulate against backyard chickens, the bill would prevent local governments from enforcing any ordinance, zoning regulation, or policy that, \"prohibits a person from keeping six or fewer backyard chickens on any residential property.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Local Government is scheduled for 9 a.m. on Aug. 26. For more information, visit legislature.ky.gov.\nFRANKFORT — According to a leading statewide business advocacy group, Kentucky would need more than 361,000 new housing units by 2050 to maintain a healthy housing market under a moderate rate of household growth.\nThat was part of the testimony John Hughes, director of government affairs for the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, offered Monday to lawmakers on the Kentucky Housing Task Force 2025.\n\"The good news is, we are starting to go in the right direction. Last year, the general assembly showed tremendous leadership by launching this housing task force, which brought together voices from every corner of the state, builders, thinkers, city leaders, workforce advocates and more,\" he said.\nHughes pointed to key legislation – House Bill 321, which addresses regulatory barriers to new development, and Senate Bill 25, which deals with zoning, flexibility and innovative financing.\n\"These actions show that this general assembly understands the state and is willing to act,\" he said.\nHughes suggested additional policy solutions to the legislators, such as exploring and encouraging local land-use and zoning reforms, considering how government regulations impact housing, and supporting regional approaches to solving challenges.\nHughes and others who testified spoke about the Indiana Residential Housing Infrastructure Assistance Program, which provides low-interest loans for communities to finance infrastructure projects for residential housing development.\n\"This program approach prioritizes jurisdictions that have taken steps to support housing and reduce regulation. Just last year alone, a $51 million investment supported 2,400 new housing units across Indiana, and the beauty of this fund is the money already being repaid and reused,\" Hughes said.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, who is also co-chair of the task force, asked Hughes if he considers the housing issue in Kentucky to be a challenge or a crisis.\n\"I would probably say it's a crisis,\" Hughes said.\nTim Schenk, general counsel of the Kentucky Bankers Association, and John Cooper, governmental affairs consultant for KBA, also offered testimony.\nSchenk said several challenges surround housing in Kentucky, including low-income and workforce housing needs, interest rates, limited federal tax credit availability, proposed elimination of federal funds, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development cuts. He said inflation has recently eased some of the challenges, however.\n\"Again, banks can address the interest rate challenge. And what we have is a $20 million commitment from banks to go towards a revolving fund, which would essentially address a lot of this housing crisis,\" he said.\nHe said HOPE of the Midwest has administered more than $784 million in tax credit construction at a zero percent default rate. The group, which is a KBA subsidiary, has worked in various types of housing, including historical, manufactured, and new. The new funding could be used where it's needed throughout the state, he said.\nRep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, said when there are partnerships using public-private funds, it's responsible to talk about parameters.\n\"You talked about state average income, but I know state average income and area median income to be vastly different, particularly where state average income can be skewed by a very wealthy person,\" he said. \"I am concerned about eligibility requirements when we're talking about the poorest of the poor Kentuckians.\"\nRep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said she has concerns that Kentucky lacks enough skilled construction workers to spur development.\nBillie Wade, executive director of HOPE of the Midwest, testified that this is certainly the case.\nRep. Shawn McPherson, R-Scottsville, asked testifier Charles Gardner, research fellow with Mercatus Center at George Mason University, if he has seen interest in auxiliary buildings being placed in large developments with larger, upscale homes and homeowners' associations.\n\"I'll tell you most of these laws that I reference, particularly ones that are enacted, contain explicit carveouts for any sort of private covenant, including HOAs. So it doesn't override the private covenant. I think, politically speaking, that would tend to be a bit more controversial. I'm not saying it couldn't be done,\" he said.\nGardner said another idea that's been broached is putting some type of time limit on HOAs so they must be renewed and won't be perpetual.\nLawmakers can't act on legislation until the general assembly meets in January 2026 or they are called into special session.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy heard Thursday from two stakeholders involved with a long-time program that helps Kentuckians stay warm in the winter, cool in the summer and manage energy costs year-round.\nShannon Hall, executive adviser for the Kentucky Department for Community Based Services, and Rick Baker, executive director of Community Action Kentucky Inc., testified about the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and a related federal grant.\n\"LIHEAP is 100% federally funded. It's a block grant that comes through the department and then is used as a pass-through to Kentucky Community Action,\" Hall said.\nHall and Baker said LIHEAP was established in 1982 during the Reagan administration, and it helps residents manage high energy costs, reduces service disconnects, reduces the need for assistance through weatherization and promotes responsibility. Payments are made directly to vendors and utility providers.\nBaker said 23 agencies subcontract with Community Action, which has administered the program since the 1980s. The agencies help ensure local interest and coordination of local services, he said.\n\"The largest benefit we have is we have a physical presence. We're the only community-based organization that has a physical presence in all 120 counties of the commonwealth,\" he said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said the program has been vital, \"as we continue to mop up the war on coal in our area.\"\n\"These programs have been so critical in saving the few families that we can from literally collapsing,\" he said.\nSmith said LIHEAP has been effective for people who needed kerosene to survive. And as fuel rates have gone up, the program has been a godsend for more and more people.\n\"I can't say that about all the programs, but this has been a remarkable one,\" he said.\nRep. Bobby McCool, R-Van Lear, said he has watched work being done for LIHEAP participants, and weatherization is hard work.\n\"You go on some of these trailers or buildings, and there's no room. And it's rocky. It's muddy. It's all these things. It makes it very difficult,\" he said.\nHe asked how return on investment is being measured.\nBaker said initially there's a model that's used and a machine is set up to measure the air infiltration before work begins on a home.\n\"Every measure that they do, every measure like caulking or insulation, every measure has to show a return on investment greater than what the cost of those materials are. So, you're saving energy costs long-term in those homes,\" he said.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, asked about a breakdown of renters and homeowners participating in the program. Baker said he didn't have the information with him, but that type of data is tracked and he will obtain it for Herron.\nShe asked about any potential funding cuts and what the legislature should be looking for or considering in the future budget session.\nHall responded that federal legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, did not take any action against LIHEAP, and the next potential hurdle would be the federal appropriations bill expected this fall.\n\"It could be a topic of funding at that point. I think until we get there, we won't know,\" he said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said he has supported the program for years.\n\"I want to echo the comments that Senator Smith made. I've worked many years with your folks, and you do a great job helping a lot of folks who really are in dire need, especially in this program,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Two Kentucky lawmakers are looking to reform Kentucky's eminent domain law.\nRep. Ryan Bivens, R-Hodgenville, and Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, were joined by two constituents to talk about eminent domain law on Thursday during the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting.\nBivens and Roberts both sponsored eminent domain legislation – House Bill 630 and House Bill 353 – earlier this year. Neither of the bills became law.\nUnder HB 630, Bivens said he sought to better protect land that is subject to an agricultural conservation easement while adding more transparency to the eminent domain process.\n\"We've got to start looking at agriculture, not as an open piece of ground that we can put a black top of concrete over it,\" Bivens said. \"We've got to think about what it does for the economy.\"\nRebecca Steele, a farmer from Bourbon County, said eminent domain has caused her family financial trouble, and even the threat of eminent domain can be costly due to the lack of transparency.\nSteele said her mother invested more than $400,000 in a dam on their property while also planning to use part of their farm as a wedding venue.\n\"When we caught wind of the threat of eminent domain, she completely stopped spending because any improvements (made to the property), we were not going to receive the value of that,\" Steele said. \"… We need more transparency as to what was going on. We needed to know if we were going to be compensated, that it was going to be fair and enough, because you can't just pick up your farm and move.\"\nBivens' bill also proposed changes to the fair market valuation process while additionally seeking to ensure owners of land used for agricultural or conservation purposes receive 125% of the highest appraised value of the property.\nRoberts, who sponsored HB 353, said his ideas for improving the eminent domain process go well with Bivens' proposals.\nRoberts told the committee he believes eminent domain has been \"vastly abused\" throughout the U.S., especially when it comes to the government seizing property for private use instead of public use.\nRoberts said since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of that practice, states, including Kentucky, have made efforts to add protections for property owners.\n\"Here in Kentucky our efforts, unfortunately, did not go far enough,\" Roberts said. \"We still have requirements that allow individuals to have their property taken and be given to other private entities.\"\nRoberts said his legislation would have banned the use of eminent domain for private use. He also proposed property owners be given proper notice and adequate time to fix a blighted property. HB 353 would have also established a public hearing process for eminent domain.\n\"What we have to do is ensure that eminent domain is truly a last resort as is intended under our current statutory scheme,\" Roberts said.\nRep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, said she agrees with Roberts' ideas \"conceptually,\" but has questions about the details.\n\"Is this a model bill? Is this something that has been implemented in other states?\" Kulkarni asked. \"The reason I asked that is because Kentucky is unique. Is there some way to tailor it more to the needs that we have specifically?\"\nRoberts said his bill was a variation on other legislation from other states.\n\"I did tailor it a little bit,\" he said. \"I'm open to amendments to make sure that it's more of a Kentucky-centric model that adequately protects Kentucky property owners, of course.\"\nRep. Wade Williams, R-Earlington, said he is \"appalled\" the government can take land for economic development. He said, as someone who works in economic development, he approaches property owners and seeks to compensate them appropriately if a deal is made.\nIn relation to seizing property for public use, like utilities, Williams asked how the proposed legislation would impact critical infrastructure needs.\nBivens said better communication is needed to make the eminent domain process less burdensome for property owners while still meeting the needs of their communities. One example he shared is asking a utility company to wait to install powerlines until after the growing season to avoid harming crops.\n\"We don't think about what impacts we leave behind, what those unintended consequences were,\" Bivens said.\nLawmakers cannot take action on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting is scheduled to meet on Aug. 29 at 11 a.m.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Information Technology Oversight Committee raised questions Wednesday about long-standing problems and financial concerns related to the KentuckyWired project.\nThe KentuckyWired network is a physical system of fiber optic cable that allows broadband internet service to be brought to Kentucky communities. Construction started in 2015, according to the Kentucky Communications Network Authority (KCNA), which has partnered to build and oversee the project.\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, said committee members want to ensure that taxpayers aren't incurring costs over and above what should be paid, and he looks forward to receiving findings from state auditor's office about the project.\n\"I think it is this committee's desire, in terms of this whole day and discussion, that we do get to the bottom of these issues,\" he said. \"The bottom line is we are here as representatives of our districts and people to make sure that we are spending Kentucky's taxpayer dollars wisely, to make sure we protect those dollars, that they are not being wasted.\"\nLorran Hart Ferguson, chief of staff for the Kentucky Auditor of Public Accounts, said Senate Bill 25 from the 2025 legislative session earmarked $1.5 million for her office to audit the project.\nFerguson said Kentuckians deserve answers to two \"big\" questions – why isn't the project complete and what needs to be done to get there. The audit is at its beginning stage, she said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, said one problem with the project is the government is involved in a \"very dynamic, fast-moving industry.\"\nHe also expressed concerns about procurement codes and if KCNA officials had a say over what happened to a contract with Accelecom, which is registered with the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office as OpenFiber Kentucky Co. LLC.\n\"This has been a big loss for the state, and it's a difference between the way KDE (Kentucky Department of Education) runs things and the way I see some state agencies. KDE, they contract out, they farm things out. They don't try to be the experts in every detail. They contract their email, they contract out their networks,\" he said.\nRepresentatives from KCNA, Accelecom, and the Kentucky Department of Education, also testified during the meeting.\nKevin H. Marino, legal counsel for Accelecom, said Accelecom is willing to renegotiate and mediate with KCNA. Things were going fine until recent leadership changes, he said. \"It's not something just anybody can do.\"\nDoug Hendrix, executive director of the KCNA, spoke about the termination of OpenFiber. In 2017, KCNA entered into a contract with OpenFiber, and its employees were essentially a sales team, he explained.\n\"They were going to go out and market this. And as I said, there was a revenue sharing agreement, but that agreement has terms and conditions like all contracts that they have to comply with. Unfortunately, as you know, since we're here, that contract's just not worked out as intended,\" he said.\nThe authority issued three notices of default to the company, Hendrix said.\n\"They've connected their network without permission. We have a temporary restraining order that the Franklin Circuit Court prohibiting them from connecting to the network without our permission,\" he said.\nRep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, asked if both political parties were cooperating with requests from the state auditor's office, and Ferguson answered, \"as of now, yes.\"\nThe next meeting of the committee is scheduled for Aug. 13 at 10 a.m. in the Capitol Annex.\nUnless a special session is called by the governor, the general assembly can't act on legislation until the regular session begins in January.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Kentucky Housing Task Force 2025 held their first meeting on Monday, discussing and learning ways to spur housing development opportunities in the commonwealth.\n\"We're hoping this interim to talk about some real-world things we can do in the state of Kentucky, be less ideological and more practical on what we can do,\" said Senate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, who is co-chair of the task force.\nWendy Smith, deputy executive director of housing programs at Kentucky Housing Corp., testified that homeownership can be an extremely challenging goal.\n\"We have folks who could get approved for a loan at… $170,000 to buy a home,\" she said. \"There used to be homes in Kentucky to buy at that amount, and there just aren't now.\"\nLast year, KHC commissioned a county-by-county supply gap analysis, and every county needs more housing, Smith said. It pointed to a gap of 206,000 units for 2024, split nearly equally between a demand for rentals and homes.\n\"For rentals, there is a greater need for our moderate and low-income households to have rental options that are affordable. For homeownership, it is almost evenly spread across all the income bands,\" Smith said.\nSmith said it's most important for the task force to set its sights on flexible resources that \"move the needle\" and accelerate housing production. She highlighted revolving loan funds, economic development tools for housing and employer-assisted housing.\n\"I'm here advocating for the building industry and the building marketplace in Kentucky. Flexible resources can move the market by incentivizing public-private partnerships that accelerate housing production everywhere in the state,\" she said.\nThe flexibility of state-level funds over federal dollars can't be overemphasized, Smith said.\nShe pointed to the Indiana Residential Infrastructure Fund as an ambitious housing goal worthy of replication. The fund provides $75 million for low interest, 20-year loans that support infrastructure projects related to rental or homeownership development. Local governments apply for the funding, which can be used for installation, replacement, upgrades and land purchases.\nSen. Jared Carpenter, R-Berea, said affordable housing is different for every person, and he asks clients what price range they seek when shopping for real estate.\n\"I'm doing a lot right now that are what we call affordable housing. I live in Berea, a really fast-growing community,\" he said.\nWhen Carpenter started building houses in a development in 2019, they were $189,000. However, on Friday, one of the houses sold for $289,000.\nCarpenter said he made the same profit on both houses even though one cost more money. He said the costs of materials to build houses have increased substantially, along with the price of lots and infrastructure such as roads.\nTask Force Co-Chair Rep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, said there's collective acceptance of the housing challenges, and the problems are not going away.\n\"The good news is that so many of the potential solutions that you all talked about, we've already talked about. These are in motion. We've been looking at other states. Our goal for this task force is to really tee up some of these pieces of legislation, vet them so that when session starts they can go right to committee and we can really get a lot done,\" she said.\nMills and others sponsored legislation last year to address infrastructure costs for developers, but it didn't gain full approval by the end of the 2025 legislative session. \"You'll probably see that coming back around,\" he said.\nM. Nolan Gray, a Bluegrass Institute scholar who testified on behalf of the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy, said he lives in California now and doesn't want to see Kentuckians face a similar housing crisis. He urged the task force to be open to successful initiatives that exist in other states.\n\"I'm coming to you from the future,\" Gray said. \"Decades of strict rules and costly mandates gets you to a place where California is today, where hundreds of thousands of people are leaving the state, where folks who remain have no path to home ownership, they're doubling or tripling up in apartments. Folks are living in tents and cars.\"\nRep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, said he has a local government housing background and he's a real estate agent. He noted that the supply gap isn't just an urban problem; it's widespread across the state.\n\"It's a 120-county wide problem. I think it's the biggest existential threat that the state is facing,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky is no stranger to natural disasters. Within in the first six months of 2025, the commonwealth has endured several significant flooding events and deadly tornadoes.\nKentucky lawmakers gathered Friday morning to discuss disaster relief funding needs during the inaugural meeting of the Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force.\nSen. Robin L. Webb, R-Grayson, co-chairs the new task force with Rep. Chris Freeland, R-Benton. Webb said the goal of the task force is to focus on how to recover and mitigate risk, and that will require the Kentucky General Assembly's budgetary support.\n\"We can't prevent (natural disasters), but we can be ready and then mitigate them, and that includes housing, quality of life, infrastructure impacts and rebuilding and prioritization of that and housing,\" Webb said. \"In East Kentucky, West Kentucky we've seen devastation for communities, and people want to live where they live and they should be able to do that.\"\nEric Gibson, the director of Kentucky's Division of Emergency Management, said Kentucky is experiencing disasters of \"increasing frequency and intensity.\"\nIf you compare Kentucky's rate of federally declared natural disasters to Florida in the last 20 years, Kentucky has had 33, which is two more than Florida, Gibson said. The frequency of natural disasters may not be entirely new, but the cost is.\n\"There has been a high level of disasters across the commonwealth for this entire period of time. The intensity of the expense is what's changing,\" Gibson said.\nA major issue facing some communities impacted by the more recent storms is public assistance funding, Gibson added.\n\"I do think that the public assistance being pending is a very important issue to your local officials, as those counties are going to be paying those expenses out of those county dollars without public assistance or state funds or a state disaster relief fund,\" Gibson said.\nReflecting on the last six months, Sen. Scott Madon, R-Pineville, mentioned how the general assembly appropriated funds during the 2025 legislative session for the February storms, but adjourned for the year before the April flooding and May tornado events.\n\"We keep hearing about the having to possibly come back for a special session,\" Madon said. \"Where are we on the money that we allocated? Are we blowing through that pretty quick?\"\nGibson said the funds allocated for the February storms has been used to help those communities. Possible federal public assistance for the more recent flooding and tornados is still pending as the state and Kentucky's congressional delegation works to secure a declaration from the president, he added.\n\"It's hard to come before you and say we need 'x' amount of dollars, because we don't even have all the projects estimated,\" Gibson said. \"But I can tell you that it's hundreds of millions of dollars that is going to be needed in our state to recover across that 83-county area.\"\nFederal funding, if approved, will cover 75% of the cost, Gibson added.\nAnother project the state is working to secure funding for is an update to the state's IFLOWS system, which is a network of water level gauges, Gibson said. The estimated cost to replace the existing 270 monitors across the state is around $1 million.\nWebb said she \"thinks it's important for the committee to note the reliability and accuracy\" of the system. Gibson said IFLOWS is crucial in monitoring rising water levels and alerting officials who then can communicate risk to the public.\nRep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, said the IFLOWS system helped his district position local resources in the right places as river levels rose during April's flooding event.\n\"They're so valuable to preparation and pre-planning,\" Hart said. \"I cannot emphasize them enough… Moving forward, we need to make sure these systems are not only maintained but enhanced to where we get more gauges out there.\"\nFRANKFORT — Some legislators want to attract veterans and service members to Kentucky, and members of the Interim Joint Committee on Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection learned about legislation Wednesday that could help those groups save money.\nRep. Peyton Griffee, R-Mount Washington, told the committee that he is working on legislation to help draw veterans and service members to the commonwealth by exempting them from the motor vehicle usage tax.\n\"There's a 6% tax on motor vehicle usage, and a lot of folks are paying this when they move from somewhere else into the commonwealth. They're getting hit with this 6% tax,\" he said.\nGriffee said the tax is burdening retirees who want to move back to Kentucky and soldiers who have a permanent change of station to Fort Knox or Fort Campbell. He said he is studying the cost of his proposal but believes it would have low financial impact to the state.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Matthew Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, said the bill isn't new, and he'd like to see it win approval during the 2026 Regular Session, which begins in January.\n\"When I first came to Frankfort, this was one of the bills that I was trying to tackle at the time. Of course, it's dealing with revenue and taxes and all of that. It has to begin in the House,\" he said.\nGriffee, a reservist himself, said some veterans and service members have paid the tax twice – once in their previous state and once again when they come to Kentucky. He said the legislation would produce good outcomes if passed, and he called it another tool to keep people who come here to serve.\n\"These are people that are trained. They are excellent, excellent folks that we want to keep for economic development, add to our workforce,\" he said. \"So, this is an easy recruiting tool for our state.\"\nGriffee also said he would like to extend the tax break for reservists and National Guardsmen in the legislation and plans to work with those groups on the proposal.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, asked if there is a limit on how many vehicles could be affected by the legislation.\n\"If you wind up being kind of a part-time car dealer, where I guess you get six or so many you can run through, then you would avoid that at the clerk's office,\" he asked.\nGriffee said it was a good and fair question.\n\"I think the intent of the bill is for personal use vehicles, and if we need to tweak that language, look at that a little bit, I think that would be something we could definitely look at,\" he said.\nSen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville, thanked Griffee for the legislation, and said that while it would probably have minimal financial impact, it would send an important message.\n\"It certainly goes a long way in waving the flag; that we're open for business for veterans and active duty here in Kentucky,\" he said.\nSen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, said he lived in several places – including Alaska, Hawaii and Virginia – when he was a service member. When he moved back to Kentucky with a vehicle he purchased in Alaska, he was concerned about the $1,400 or $1,500 in motor vehicle taxes.\n\"For a new guy coming off of active duty back into the civilian world, that was a kick in the teeth because I had to come up with it or I couldn't drive my truck,\" he said.\nDeneen said there are some compacts between Kentucky and other states regarding waiving the motor vehicle tax. However, one doesn't exist with Georgia.\n\"Regardless of what Georgia does, I want Kentucky to be veteran friendly, active duty friendly. I want them to reside here and retire here, and so I support this, your efforts here, and I hope we can see this move forward in this next session,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Safer storage methods for firearms and medication and expanded access to child care were some of the proposals that surfaced among lawmakers Wednesday to help prevent child fatalities in Kentucky.\nThe Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children discussed these ideas following a presentation on the 2024 Annual Report from the state's External Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Panel.\nThe panel is comprised of 22 experts who have backgrounds in social work, law, law enforcement, health care, state government, policy and more. Interim committee co-chairs Rep. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, and Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, are members.\nPanel Chairman Benjamin Harrison, who is also the Lewis County Attorney, said the panel is required to meet quarterly, but has been meeting monthly due to the caseload.\nThe 2024 Annual Report includes data from 219 cases, Harrison said, with 70 fatalities and 149 near fatalities.\n\"From our 2024 report, it shows that since 2014, 75% of all cases reviewed by the panel were children aged four years or younger,\" Harrison said. \"The panel has continuously found children in this age group are at a higher risk for a fatal or near fatal event due to maltreatment.\"\nOverdose/ingestion cases are the most common types of cases the panel sees, Harrison added. According to the report, 95% of all overdose/ingestion cases involved environmental neglect, or unsafe access.\nHarrison said firearm incidents involving children in Kentucky have declined post the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they're still a cause of concern. The panel has reviewed 79 firearm incidents in the last five years, which is a small subset of the overall pediatric firearm injuries in Kentucky, he said.\n\"In fiscal year '23, the panel reviewed 12 cases involving injuries by firearms. All but one resulted in a death,\" Harrison added. \"58% of all firearm cases involved a handgun. And a handgun, we found, was used in every child suicide case reviewed by the panel, and the panel has identified 75% of these cases were noted to be potentially preventable.\"\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said she wanted to know how Kentucky's laws \"stack up\" with parental accountability in child firearm cases.\n\"Do you think that the recommendations around safer storage and locks is kind of where we're headed at this moment in time?\" she asked.\nPanel member Steve Shannon, who is the executive director of the Kentucky Association of Regional Programs, said safe storage is a high priority.\n\"Of my opinion, the adult who has the gun has a cavalier attitude to the gun in the home,\" he said, giving an example of one adult in a case who said they kept their gun stored behind a television.\nAs for parental accountability in relation to overdose/ingestion cases, Carroll said he's found no consistency with how law enforcement investigates these types of cases in Kentucky along with a lack of \"statutory authority.\"\n\"That is on my list for the (2026) session to maybe address that, because these numbers are alarming the way that they're growing, and there does not seem to be any accountability for those who are responsible for those kids in these cases,\" he said. \"And in a lot of cases, there's not being thorough investigations conducted.\"\nPrevention was also discussed by the committee. Sen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, and Heavrin both shared their thoughts on the importance of examining the root cause of the events leading up to the child's death or near death.\n\"To me, it's just very alarming that it's financial issues, then criminal history – which typically if people have financial issues they get into criminal behavior – and then that leads to the mental health, the trauma and then the domestic violence,\" Herron said, adding she hopes every committee in the legislature is examining the root causes of these issues moving forward.\nHeavrin said the panel examines the root causes of each case.\n\"Most of these have prior (Department of Community Based Services) cases and issues that are going on,\" Heavrin said. \"So what can we do for prevention?\"\nHeavrin also mentioned how children under the age of four are more likely victims since they're not in school. Carroll, who works in the child care industry, said fixing Kentucky's child care issues could help.\n\"Last week within our facility, we had three different reports to DCBS,\" he said. \"What are we preventing by reporting those things? What else could we prevent? What else could all the other centers throughout the state prevent if more kids were within their facilities?\"\nLawmakers cannot take action on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children Committee is scheduled to meet on July 30 at 1 p.m.\nCOVINGTON — Jaimee Kelley Seitz is one of several parents in Kentucky who have lost their children to suicide. She, and other youth suicide prevention advocates, testified Wednesday before the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services.\nThe committee met at The Madison Event Center in Covington as part of a full day of committee hearings in Northern Kentucky.\nSeitz's daughter, Audree Heine, committed suicide when she was 13 years old, and Seitz said her goal moving forward is to raise awareness so no other mother will have to go through the same grief.\n\"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell Audree's story because it's important to know that this is not an isolated situation, and it's a situation that needs our attention and a plan and action to protect our children,\" she said.\nSeitz said parents often think they know how their children are feeling and what they are thinking, but she was not aware her daughter suffered from mental illness.\nOthers testified about ongoing efforts to address youth mental health and prevent suicide.\nBeck Whipple, suicide prevention coordinator for the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities and a suicide attempt survivor, said his department uses data to drive decisions on prevention, intervention, and postvention strategies.\nWhipple testified that suicide deaths happen more often with males, but young female deaths are on the rise.\n\"As we look these numbers, we must never forget that each of those numbers represent a Kentucky child who is still loved and deeply, deeply missed. As we hold on to those numbers, we hold those families, those communities and their friends as well,\" he said.\nWhipple shared information from Kentucky Vital Statistics' death certification files from 2018-2023.\nIn 2018, 25 children ages 8-17 committed suicide, and the number rose to 30 by 2023.\nWhipple said the usage of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline has been increasing, but some people – especially young people – might not trust 988 for calls, texts and chats due to tracking.\nBut he added that \"those call takers will not ask you identifiable information. They will not ask you your age, your race, your gender. What you share is what they track.\"\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, said the topic of youth suicide is difficult to discuss, but it is necessary. She said the goal of the meeting was to focus on hope that community-led suicide prevention works, that recovery is possible and that support is available.\n\"It's necessary to ensure that families with children receive the protection and the resources that they need to keep their kids safe,\" she said.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, said not talking about suicide has contributed to today's crisis. She said legislators need to see more data about who those who commit suicide are and their modes and methods to better understand the issues. She expressed concern about the role firearms play in some cases.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, asked what legislators could do to this upcoming session to significantly impact the suicide-by-firearms rate in Kentucky.\nMarcie Timmerman, education and outreach liaison for Mental Health America of Kentucky, testified that she isn't sure there's one law, or that law would always be the way. She said Kentucky ranks 36th in youth mental health as measured by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\"So, working on folks to just be able to understand how important that (firearms) storage is, and how important putting time between someone's decision to direct suicide and their access to the most lethal means. That's what CALM (Counseling on Access to Lethal Means) really focuses on,\" she said.\nRep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, said he has not seen enough information getting out to students and parents through a cooperative and collaborative approach.\n\"I've been in mental health services for 10 years, and we've been trying to put more information to not only the kids, but also the parents,\" he said.\nHe said he wants to follow up with Jon Akers, executive director of the Kentucky Center for School Safety, about using digital methods and applications to provide students with resources on mental health and suicide prevention.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky is known for its rich and vital farmland, but members of the Interim Joint Committee on Agriculture heard testimony Thursday about how much is being lost and efforts to prevent the trend.\nEddie Melton, president of Kentucky Farm Bureau, and Aleta Botts, coordinator of the Kentucky Farmland Transition Initiative, testified that many organizations are working to stop farmland loss through the initiative.\nThe KFTI network includes 28 members, connecting attorneys, certified public accountants, estate planners, business advisers and others. Members include businesses, organizations and universities.\n\"In 20 years, we've lost 1.4 million acres of farmland in the Commonwealth of Kentucky,\" Melton said.\nBut what really jumped out to stakeholders was that from 2017 to 2022, more than 500,000 acres of farmland were lost, he said.\n\"We also lost about 6,500 farmers in Kentucky in those five years. And if that continues on with the loss of the farmland and the loss of farmers, in 60 years, we'll lose over half of the farmers that we've got left in the Commonwealth of Kentucky,\" Melton said.\nMelton said updating a tax credit program aimed at farmer retention has been good. He thanked Committee Co-Chair Myron Dossett, R-Pembroke, for introducing the legislation during the 2025 regular session. It was ultimately enacted as part of House Bill 775, he said.\nThe tax credit was increased to $50,000 for land sold to a beginning farmer. Credits can be approved prior to a sale, and all active farmers can benefit from the incentive to keep farmland in production, according to KFB.\nRep. David Hale, R-Wellington, said he's excited about the process and the effort behind the Kentucky Farmland Transition Initiative. He said he hopes it's successful because something needs to be done to retain farmland.\n\"I'm concerned. I'm very concerned as we move forward. Even in my rural district…we are seeing such a loss of farmland right there in the three counties that I represent – Menifee, Bath and Montgomery County,\" he said.\nSen. Robin L. Webb, R-Grayson, said she supports the initiative. She discussed a recent instance in which a family sold a portion of their hayfield for commercial purposes. The tax valuation increased to the point of a commercial site for the remaining land, she said.\n\"I think that's unconscionable. I think we've got to address that because it's going to negate the initiatives that we do, if that's the case,\" Webb said.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, said the information she garnered was great, and asked about the tax credit for new farmers.\n\"It seems like a lot of it is having to do with transitioning from older generations to the next generation. Is there any aspect of it that is helping first-time farm owners, especially when you're talking about only 20% coming in – only 20% making it through the second generation,\" she said. \"How are we supporting people who don't come from farming families but are interested in going into it?\"\nBotts said she thinks they are getting more inquiries from those interested in becoming first-generation farmers. She mentioned it can be a challenging process, but options are possible.\n\"That selling farmer tax credit – a non-generational or a first-generational farmer would be eligible as this purchaser, as the buyer, for that selling farmer,\" she said.\nJessie Hancock, executive director of nonprofit Bluegrass Land Conservancy, and Ashley Greathouse, counsel and director of conservation for BLC, also testified.\n\"I think that it's really heartening to hear this conversation happening on a state level. I think that there's a lot of different angles to the conversation and people are really speaking about this a lot. So, it's wonderful that we've got different organizations that are working on the same effort,\" Hancock said.\n\"We use a tool called conservation easement to do that. We work with working farmers and working land to ensure that that land stays available for farming in the future,\" she said.\nAccording to BLC, Kentucky has lost 17,000 farms during the last 20 years and loses 12 acres per day of forest land.\nDossett thanked Hancock and Greathouse for testifying and said it's tremendously beneficial to pass on important information to his constituents.\nExcept for a special session, the Kentucky General Assembly can't act on legislation until the regular session begins in January 2026. The next IJC on Agriculture meeting is scheduled for July 10 at 9 a.m.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky's incarcerated youth often need mental health treatment. The Department of Juvenile Justice wants to build a $35 million high acuity mental health facility to care for them.\nCommissioner Randy White told the Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary on Wednesday there is a \"high need\" for this type of facility, which is in the early planning phases.\nIncarcerated children in Kentucky are currently receiving treatment in detention centers, which delays care and is often unsafe for the youth and staff, White said.\nFor an individual with severe needs, the department tries to have them placed into a private mental health facility. White said this means the youth is often sent out of state. He shared a recent example of a child who was placed in a treatment facility in Pennsylvania.\n\"When we require or seek placement for these violent individuals – if we're fortunate enough to obtain a bed and position and treatment for these individuals – we have to send them far away from their support base and far away from their homes,\" White said. \"It could be somewhat traumatic for them to move that distance.\"\nWhite said the incarcerated children who need in-patient, high acuity treatment are often violent, which makes them difficult to place. State law does not require a mental health facility to accept these patients, he said. Sometimes youth sent to other states for treatment are returned due to the safety risk.\nRebecca Norton, who serves as the budget director for the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, said the $35 million figure is a \"preliminary estimate\" based on a preliminary investigation into the project. The cabinet currently doesn't have the funding to complete the design phase of the project, she said.\n\"The costs listed here are based on discussions that have been had as far as what would be requirements for square footage, and that's based on the number of beds,\" Norton said.\nThe proposed facility would have 24 beds, with 16 beds for clinical patients and eight beds for assessment and stabilization needs. The facility would have to be separated by gender and high- and low-risk offenders, as per statute, Norton told the committee.\nThe estimated annual operating budget for the facility is $12.1 million, she added.\nSubcommittee Co-Chair Stephanie Dietz, R-Edgewood, asked White and Norton if there is a need for that many beds.\n\"Do you believe that we have that many youths that would qualify under the criteria for this type of facility?\" Dietz asked.\nWhite said the need for beds fluctuates.\n\"We see surges. We may go through five or 10 or we may see one or two,\" he said. \"… We have to have flexibility, and it's not going to involve filling 24 or 18 beds consistently. We have to have the degrees of separation operationally to make sure that they're safe. I can get you an exact number, but we do have individuals right now that could be placed in a high acuity facility.\"\nNorton said there is a \"multitude\" of youth within Kentucky's juvenile justice system who have a mental health diagnosis and would benefit from an in-state facility dedicated to incarcerated youth.\nRep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, said he'd like to know if it is cost-effective to build this type of facility.\n\"I would be curious to see what the contract rate out of state is, because if that can be accommodated some other way, it seems like the numbers are just a little off from where I'm sitting,\" he said, after learning one to five individuals are sent out of state per year due to needing intensive, specialized care.\nDietz asked if renovating some of the current juvenile justice detention centers to accommodate the mental health needs is an option.\nWhite said renovations often cost more than building a new, standalone facility. Norton agreed it is not possible for some of the current facilities to be expanded due to space and financial reasons.\nRep. Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, asked if the department has discussed letting other states send incarcerated youth to Kentucky's facility if the state decides to build one.\nWhite said he isn't aware of any internal discussions, but there are legal and logistical things to consider.\n\"We would just have to see what the bed space looked like and review the legal challenges associated with that,\" White said, adding Kentucky sends youth to private, out-of-state facilities, not publicly-funded facilities.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6. The next Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary meeting is scheduled for July 15 at 9 a.m.\nFor more information, visit legislature.ky.gov.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Education garnered insight from Kentucky's top education official Tuesday regarding development of the state's new education assessment and accountability model.\nEducation Commissioner Robbie Fletcher presented an overview of the model and said it's based on three priorities – providing vibrant learning experiences for all students, encouraging innovation and creating a \"bold new future\" for the state's schools through collaboration with communities.\nThe effort was spurred by the Kentucky United We Learn Council, led by the Kentucky Department of Education and funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\"You've seen some of this stuff firsthand,\" Fletcher testified. \"You've seen how districts are including students as part of the decision-making in their learning. You've seen districts that test students where they are then also make sure they have a pathway moving forward to meet their needs in reading, mathematics and other areas. But also too, collaboration.\"\nPrototypes for the program were developed last summer, and the goal is to have an approved, reimagined accountability system by the summer of 2026. The KDE, council and stakeholders are in an advocacy phase for the accountability system now, Fletcher said.\nThe proposed system calls for students to demonstrate knowledge and skills in a variety of ways and for state tests that meet student where they are. Additionally, districts would work with communities to design custom accountability systems that reflect local values, and all schools would receive peer and expert external feedback to support improvement.\nRep. Emily Callaway, R-Louisville, said she was grateful for the update, and it's amazing to see morale at an area technology center and witness students' skills and leadership abilities of administrators.\n\"I want to reiterate, while we talk about all this, it is really good to see the implementation and so I'm encouraged by that. I'd like to see it in the other district that I represent,\" she said.\nSen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, said he's concerned about how American students are not keeping up with students from other nations in science. He pointed to rural communities without a hospital, for example, where students could gain valuable work experience.\n\"When you've got limited resources and limited opportunities for collaborative relationships, how do we address that kind of inequity?\"\nFletcher said there are collaborative efforts that are working despite distance between students and worksites.\n\"We're seeing not only districts work with their local community, but they're also collaborating with neighboring districts. I can think of at least two districts that work together…\" he said. \"The students in Menifee County are going to Montgomery County to work there.\"\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, said she's a special education teacher who provides accommodations for third, fourth and fifth-graders to take the Kentucky Summative Assessment.\n\"The KSA is not, as it is today, not meaningful, nor useful to educators or students. For example, our fifth graders had 10 hours and 20 minutes of scheduled testing time. In comparison, the Kentucky Bar Exam is 12 hours,\" she said.\nBojanowski asked if Fletcher he could share data about how much of the other scores are explained by math and reading.\nFletcher said districts have collected correlation data to learn how their individual assessments match up. Some districts use STAR Literacy Assessments or MAP Growth Assessments for reading and math to inform the decision-making.\nPoverty is one issue that should be kept at the forefront in student success efforts, said Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville. She said poverty could be a big barrier to education.\n\"I know it was mentioned earlier about extracurricular activities and the correlation to that…what about housing and food insecurity and transportation,\" she asked.\nJesse Bacon, superintendent of the Bullitt County School District, said more awareness of poverty emerged as the accountability system was being developed.\n\"That will become a part of the expectation conversations that we have. In those pillars is making sure that we are accounting for those things, making sure… students who are struggling with poverty issues have the same opportunities to participate in all of the different activities that are available to any student in our district,\" he said.\nRep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said she favors the emphasis on skills and testing and the collaborations between students, administrators and businesses.\n\"I appreciated your comment about the fact that sometimes the communities just receive education, but here they have input in it. And thank you for all the work you're doing,\" she told Fletcher.\nFRANKFORT — The first week of committee meetings of the 2025 interim period begin June 3 for Kentucky lawmakers.\nAn interim joint committee is composed of all members of a Senate standing committee and all members of a House standing committee.

However, the building will close this summer for a massive, multi-year restoration project, and lawmakers will convene in a temporary structure on the Capitol campus during the work.\n\"Tomorrow will likely be the last time a majority of us will serve in this role in this building,\" House Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy, R-Paducah, said during a solemn speech on the House floor Thursday, reminding members to clean out their desks before leaving for the year.\nLike most years, the building has played host to a historic session in 2025, one in which lawmakers passed more than 140 bills and debated hundreds more over the 30-day period.\nA measure on tax reform carried momentum from the start as lawmakers voted to cut Kentucky's income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% beginning next year. Despite some criticism, the legislation won bipartisan support this session, and the governor signed the bill into law in February.\nAs the weeks continued, bills on college diversity programs, workplace safety, transgender-related services, maternal health, Medicaid, and environmental regulations all won final passage following hard-fought debates in committee and on the chamber floors.\nThe governor issued more than two dozen vetoes on those topics and more. But in the end, lawmakers once again demonstrated the independence of the general assembly, overriding virtually all the governor's vetoes during a full day of floor proceedings Thursday.\nOther bills passed with greater consensus, including measures to boost the film industry, combat underage tobacco use, curb cell phones in schools, and fight sexual extortion.\nTeenagers will likely remember 2025 as the year when lawmakers coalesced around a bill to reduce the age for a learner's permit, and college athletes are poised to benefit from updates to Kentucky name, image and likeness law.\nBut the future is still pending for a handful of bills that lawmakers volleyed to the governor's desk before gaveling to a close Friday.\nAmong them is Senate Bill 181, which calls on school districts to implement traceable communication systems for staff and volunteers to use when communicating electronically with students.\nLawmakers also gave final passage to legislation on manufactured housing – House Bill 160. It would prohibit local governments from adopting or enforcing zoning regulations that treat manufactured homes differently from site-built homes in single family residential zones.\nBoth measures are headed to the governor with around two dozen more, and the governor will have 10 days to sign them into law, issue vetoes or allow them to become law without his signature.\nAny bills that become law will only add to the pile of legislative winners this year. From athletics to the Ten Commandments, lawmakers have touched on a long list of issues, and here's a final look as some of the most watched legislation from 2025:\nLawmakers will return to Frankfort in June for the interim period, during which they can hold committee hearings on issues and consider proposals for the 2026 legislative session.\nKentuckians can continue to track the action through the general assembly's webpage, which will provide a weekly calendar of committee meetings during the interim period. Citizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — Scores of bills are headed to the governor's desk, including key measures on college diversity, maternal health, and gender identity, after lawmakers made a final, grinding push this week to wrangle votes and hammer out compromises between the House and Senate.\nThe last full week of the 2025 legislative session wrapped up near midnight on Friday, capping off several days of exhaustive floor proceedings in both chambers and marking the start of the veto recess.\nThe governor now has 10 days to sign bills, veto them, or allow them to become law without his signature. Legislators will have an opportunity to override any vetoes when they return for the final two days of the session at the end of this month.\nOne of the most watched bills is House Bill 4, a measure that seeks to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives – known as DEI – at public postsecondary institutions in Kentucky.\nThe legislation would forbid differential treatment in hiring, admissions, scholarships and other areas based on religion, race, sex, color or national origin. It would also prevent campuses from requiring or incentivizing students to in participate in DEI training, and it would prohibit public institutions from using resources on DEI training, offices and initiatives.\nThe issue has loomed large over the session: Lawmakers held multiple committee hearings on DEI during the 2024 interim period and signaled early on that a major bill was likely to win support this year.\nThe proposal ignited a final round of tense debate Thursday as lawmakers sparred over the racial disparities and the legacy of slavery before voting 32-6 to advance HB 4 off the Senate floor. The bill has been delivered to the governor.\nAbortion also surfaced as major issue in the past week after lawmakers expanded a measure on freestanding birthing centers into a broader maternal health bill that seeks to clarify some uncertainties over Kentucky's abortion law.\nThe final version of House Bill 90 includes provisions to ensure that women experiencing a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, or other life-threatening complications can receive care. It calls for hospitals, birthing centers and other obstetric care centers to offer perinatal palliative care to women if their baby is at risk of death or severe abnormalities.\nProponents say the legislation will help alleviate confusion for doctors when a pregnancy is jeopardizing a woman's life. However, some lawmakers criticized the sponsors for not gathering more input from health care providers or doing more to address concerns with Kentucky's abortion law.\nMeanwhile, the bill's provisions on freestanding birthing centers have marked a significant breakthrough for supporters, who have labored for years to rally a coalition around the concept. That portion of HB 90 would create a regulatory framework for the centers to operate in Kentucky and eliminate the certificate of need requirement for small centers.\nHB 90 cleared a divided final vote in both chambers Thursday and was delivered to the governor.\nMuch of the 2025 has focused on high-profile social issues, and few have garnered more attention or debate than publicly-funded services for transgender Kentuckians.\nSenate Bill 2 moved out of the gate early this year, seeking to prohibit public funds from being spent on certain procedures, treatments and surgeries related to gender transition in Kentucky prisons. The bill won final approval in the House late Friday 73-12.\nAnother measure – House Bill 495 – would nullify an executive order that the governor issued in September banning the use of state funds on conversion therapy for minors. The bill was expanded this week to prohibit the use of Medicaid funds on hormone treatments or surgeries related to transgender care.\nIt also won final passage in the House on Friday 70-18.\nMany other measures have secured broad, bipartisan support this year, and among those, Senate Bill 3 proved once again that sports are the great uniter in the commonwealth.\nThe legislation would update Kentucky's name, image and likeness law for college athletes, aligning it with national standards in the aftermath of the House v. NCAA court case. The case could open the door to universities directly compensating student athletes.\nSB 3 sailed off the House floor on Tuesday with unanimous support, and the governor signed it into law Thursday.\nBut of all the stakeholders celebrating legislative victories this year, teenagers may be celebrating the most.\nThat's thanks to House Bill 15, which would reduce the minimum age for getting a learner's permit in Kentucky from 16 to 15 years old. The legislation breezed through final votes in both chambers this week and has been sent to the governor.\nOther measures on artificial intelligence, fraud, workplace safety, state regulations, and education have all received a final tap of the gavel. Here's a look at some of the bills that won final passage this week.\nLawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on March 27 and 28 for the final two days of this year's 30-day session.\nKentuckians can track the action this year through Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — House Bill 90 has undergone a metamorphosis throughout the legislative process, but the lawmakers behind the legislation hope it will provide better maternal health outcomes across Kentucky.\nHB 90 began as only a bill to establish a regulatory framework for freestanding birthing centers and remove the certificate of need requirement for centers with no more than four beds, House Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, said.\nThose provisions remain, but as the bill advanced off the House floor on Thursday, lawmakers also voted to provide clarifying language to Kentucky's abortion law and make perinatal palliative care available in Kentucky hospitals.\nDoctors have communicated to the legislature that the current abortion ban law is confusing, which is putting pregnant women in potentially deadly situations, Nemes, who is the primary sponsor of HB 90, said.\n\"This is a problem that is real and present, and we need to solve it,\" he said.\nThe clarifications to Kentucky's abortion law in HB 90 will ensure pregnant women experiencing a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy or other life-threatening complications can receive care, Nemes added.\nRep. Nancy Tate, R-Brandenburg, Rep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, Dr. Jeffery Goldberg with the Kentucky Chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and pro-life advocates worked with Nemes on the legislation, he said.\nNemes said the bill is not an exception to the abortion law, but a clarification.\n\"There are no additional abortion exceptions or exceptions to abortions in this bill,\" he said. \"It's a clarification of what it means when a pregnant woman is presenting and her life is in jeopardy.\"\nHB 90 also includes language from House Bill 414 on perinatal palliative care, Nemes said. Tate has filed perinatal palliative care legislation in the past and is the primary sponsor of this year's HB 414.\nThe bill would require hospitals, birthing centers and other obstetric care centers to offer perinatal palliative care to women who receive a prenatal diagnosis that their baby may die before or after birth or at the diagnosis of a potentially deadly or life-altering fetal abnormality.\nTate said the care would be optional and would serve as a source of support for a mother and a family going through a difficult time.\n\"Perinatal palliative care is to ensure when a woman has a less than perfect pregnancy … that the woman and her family will have the spiritual, emotional, financial and medical attention they need,\" Tate said.\nSeveral lawmakers raised concerns about the clarifying language on abortions during a nearly hour-long debate on HB 90 on the House floor. Several members said the language is confusing, lacks proper medical terminology and doesn't go far enough to ensure care and protect physicians from criminal liability.\nRep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, said she appreciates the intent of the language and the collaboration behind the bill, but finds the language concerning. She asked Nemes if he intends to keep working on the issue.\n\"Dr. Goldberg … was one of maybe the most ambiguous testifiers I've ever heard in committee. He said multiple times, 'This is very imperfect. This needs lots of work,'\" Willner said. \"… Do you agree this is going to be an ongoing conversation, and we may be able to get to a safer, from my perspective, place, or is this the end of the conversation?\"\nNemes said while he believes Goldberg's testimony was clear, he agrees the legislation is not perfect.\n\"We are committed to having those continued conversations,\" Nemes said.\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said she was proud to vote for the freestanding birthing center bill when it came to the House floor for a vote the first time. She said while the language in the new HB 90 \"is not medically accurate,\" she would vote \"yes\" on the legislation.\n\"I do intend to vote yes today because if it does grant a pregnant individual the opportunity to have life-saving care, then we need to do that,\" Roarx said.\nHB 90 advanced off the House floor by a 74-17 vote, and the Senate voted 29-0 with five pass votes on the legislation earlier Thursday.\n\"I don't want to mislead anybody. Kentucky is a pro-life state, and it will stay as such,\" Nemes said. \"But if we have to do things to continue to improve the lives of pregnant women in danger and to help doctors, we are committed to doing that.\"\nHB 90 is now headed to the governor's desk for his signature or veto. He can also allow the bill to become law without his signature.\nFRANKFORT — After impassioned debate Wednesday afternoon, the Kentucky Senate adopted a bill that seeks to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at public postsecondary intuitions in Kentucky.\nHouse Bill 4, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, advanced off the Senate floor with a 36-6 vote. It was presented on the chamber floor by Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris.\nWest said the legislation seeks to ensure that Kentucky's public universities are focused on providing opportunity for everyone – not advancing policies that divide students into competing groups. The legislation would remove mandates that focus on identity politics rather than meri-based academic success, he said.\n\"Every student regardless of background deserves a fair shot, and that's what this body should be committed to. There's a strong legal precedent in the constitution and in recent court cases for the passage and implementation of House Bill 4,\" he said.\nThe measure would prohibit differential treatment at public colleges and universities based on religion, race, sex, color or national origin in hiring, admissions, scholarships and contracts. It would also halt the use of institutional resources to create or maintain a DEI office, training or initiative.\nAmong other provisions, HB 4 would prevent institutions from requiring students to complete courses that indoctrinate participants in discriminatory concepts. Campuses could not require or incentivize students, faculty or staff to attend a DEI training, and any investigations of a bias incident would require authorization by the general counsel and meet certain criteria.\nWest said the DEI prohibitions do not include the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, sex-based dormitory restrictions and athletic eligibility, accommodations for religion, the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX and others.\nLawmakers debated the bill for nearly two hours, recounting personal stories and, at times, discussing the history of race and slavery in America.\nSenate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald A. Neal, D-Louisville, was among several who spoke in opposition to the bill, and recalled how he marched with civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. He said he wanted to put the past and present in context.\n\"What I'm saying is, even today you hear the language, there's nothing systemic. There's nothing structural. Everything we do is systemic. Every time we do a policy we're setting up some type of system, a framework, guidelines, context,\" he said. \"And we enforce it. And guess what, what we don't do, enhances or allows for those unofficial behaviors to take shape, which are manifest today. We all know it. Racism is wide and deep.\"\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, also spoke against the measure. He read from an e-mailed letter from four Roman Catholic bishops of Kentucky. It stated that \"those who are in positions of power or who have benefitted from a system of inequalities have a moral responsibility to address injustice.\"\nSpeaking in favor of the measure was Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, who argued that the legislation is about establishing \"a fair playing field for all.\" He said the goals of DEI begin in the home with parental support.\n\"Let us consider strengthening our homes first. Let us consider teaching our children the self-respect, the self-motivation and the self-accomplishment and monitoring their independent thought, their personal responsibility and their accountability for their own personal decisions,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads back to the House. If lawmakers concur with the final version of the bill, it will next head to the governor's desk.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that would change how the state regulates water pollution advanced off the House floor on Wednesday.\nRep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, presented Senate Bill 89 on the House floor on behalf of the bill's primary sponsor, Sen. Scott Madon, R-Pineville. Gooch said the legislation would protect the coal industry from restrictive regulations.\n\"We are now seeing unwanted government overreach from our very own Energy an Environment Cabinet,\" Gooch said. \"Permitting delays have happened that cause unnecessary red tape.\"\nGooch said the \"out of control\" regulatory process could impose $100 million in additional costs for the coal industry. The legislation is a response to a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the federal government's ability to regulate water pollution for certain bodies of water, he added.\nA major provision of SB 89 would change the definition of \"waters of the commonwealth,\" Gooch said.\nAn amendment made to the bill during the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee meeting earlier Wednesday morning would include navigable waters, sinkholes with open drains, naturally occurring springs and wellhead protection areas in the definition.\nAll rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, impounding reservoirs, springs, wells, marshes, and all other bodies of surface or underground water, natural or artificial would be removed from the definition under this bill.\nAdditionally, SB 89 would change the bond protocol regarding long-term water treatment permits for coal companies.\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, asked Gooch if the legislation would impact a creek near her home.\nGooch said he believes the cabinet could still regulate other types of water not specifically mentioned in the bill.\nIn a floor speech, Rep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, urged everyone to vote \"no\" on SB 89. He said he believes the bill threatens Kentucky's drinking water supply and the environment.\n\"This is not just an environmental issue, my friends,\" Aull said. \"This bill will also affect our economy and our people's health. This bill would require additional treatment for drinking and wastewater because fewer water sources would be protected upstream.\n\"The increased cost of additional testing would be passed down to Kentuckians through rate increases in our water bills.\"\nIn response, Gooch said one of the biggest sources of groundwater issues is sedimentation caused by changes in water levels and another is highway and parking lot runoff.\nHazardous substance dumping would still be illegal if SB 89 becomes law, Gooch added.\nSeveral lawmakers shared concerns on the House floor about the potential for the legislation to cause carcinogens and other harmful materials to contaminate the water. Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, asked Gooch if he would be willing to fix any unforeseen consequence caused by the legislation.\nGooch said he would.\n\"With proper knowledge and facts showing that there were detrimental impacts because of this, yes ma'am, you have my word,\" he said.\nRep. Ryan Bivens, R-Hodgenville, spoke in favor of SB 89. He said as a farmer, his biggest concern is government overreach. He also doesn't believe SB 89 would threaten Kentucky's drinking water.\n\"Folks, we're not going backwards on this,\" Bivens said. \"We still have regulation in place that we're going to follow ... Our water is much cleaner today than it's ever been.\"\nSB 89 advanced off the House floor by a 69-26 vote.\nRep. Vanessa Grossl, R-Georgetown, said she proudly voted \"yes\" on the bill because it addresses regulatory uncertainty that is having a negative impact on construction and infrastructure improvements.\n\"This bill safeguards our natural resources while promoting responsible growth,\" Grossl said. \"This framework provides predictability for developers who are building affordable housing in central Kentucky and ensuring that those essential environmental protections remain in place.\"\nSB 89 will need to return to the Senate for concurrence on changes made to the legislation before it can go to the governor's desk for his signature or veto.\nFRANKFORT — A Senate bill that would impose new regulations on cannabis-infused beverages in Kentucky took another step toward final passage on Wednesday.\nSen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, told the House Licensing, Occupations and Administrative Regulations Committee that Senate Bill 202 would put reasonable, common sense public health guardrails in place for cannabis-infused beverages.\nAdams said she began working on the bill after hearing about the beverages and their potency during an interim meeting in September.\n\"This is some really serious stuff that's out there,\" Adams said. \"Everybody from that September meeting started coming to the table and talking about how we can put some controls on this to protect kids from getting their hands on it.\"\nIndividuals under the age of 21 would be prohibited from purchasing a cannabis-infused beverage under SB 202.\nAdams said the recently updated version of SB 202 would define a cannabis-infused beverage as a cannabinoid-liquid, intoxicating product that does not contain more than 5 milligrams per a 12-ounce serving.\nThe drinks would fall under the purview of the Division of Distilled Spirits and retail regulations enforcement would be handled by the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), Adams said. The state Cabinet for Health and Family Services would continue to regulate the manufacturing and testing of the products, she added.\nFor retailers that currently have products on the shelves at more than 5 milligrams, Adams said they would have until June 1 to remove those products from their stores.\nFestivals and fairs would have until Jan. 1, 2026, Adams added.\nSB 202 would also require businesses who want to sell cannabis-infused beverages to hold a license.\nSeveral consumers and representatives from the hemp industry testified against SB 202 in committee on Wednesday. They believe the bill would harm the hemp industry, Kentucky businesses and recovering alcoholics who use the products to stay sober and prevent withdrawal symptoms.\nJim Higdon, co-founder of Cornbread Hemp, asked the committee to consider changing the milligram cap from 5 to 25, which other states, like Tennessee, have done.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, asked the group about hemp's economic impact on Kentucky since hemp was legalized around a decade ago.\n\"It's a $330 million economy that employs 3,000 people,\" Annie Rouse, a licensed hemp manufacturer, distributor and retailer, said.\nHouse Minority Caucus Chair Al Gentry, D-Louisville, asked Adams how she determined the limit should be 5 milligrams in the legislation.\nAdams said several things influenced that decision, including a study from Johns Hopkins University.\n\"The Johns Hopkins study put 3.75 is when (the beverages) begin the intoxicating effects, so we thought 5 milligrams was above that study,\" she said. \"We thought that was a good place to start.\"\nOn treating cannabis-infused beverages similarly to alcoholic beverages, Gentry said he agrees there should be parity, but he doesn't think SB 202 hits that mark.\n\"I don't believe the bill as it is written today does that because it bans all the products above 5 milligrams,\" he said. \"I think we should be more focused on putting guardrails about that, warning what the products are.\"\nThe committee voted 16-2 with two pass votes to advance SB 202 to the House floor.\nRep. Michael Meredith, R-Oakland, who voted \"yes\" on the legislation, said he remembers when the general assembly passed the hemp bill.\n\"I really don't think when that was contemplated back in 2011 or 2012 that we contemplated anything like this proliferation in this space,\" he said, adding he doesn't think the bill is perfect right now, but he's seen it improve as it's made its way through the legislative process.\nAdams said SB 202 is just a starting point.\n\"We revisit bills all the time, and will we revisit this? 100%,\" she said. \"Should we talk about it in the interim? 100% Will we get to an even better place? 100%. But we have got to stop this proliferation. We have to stop the ability of these products getting into the hands of our kids.\"\nFRANKFORT — Studies show cell phones are a major distraction for primary and secondary education students. House Bill 208 seeks to resolve the issue in public schools across Kentucky.\nRep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, is the primary sponsor of the legislation. He said on the House floor on Tuesday that the legislation would require the board of education for each public school district to adopt a policy on the possession and use of personal telecommunication devices by students during the school day.\nBray said studies show limiting student cell phone use at school improves mental health and test scores.\n\"There's been a lot of research done on cell phones with kids and the damages it causes to their mental health and to their ability to learn when they're near,\" Bray said. \"There have been studies done that show in school districts that have implemented policies to prohibit their usage during instructional time, test scores have jumped up by 6% pretty immediately.\"\nThe House adopted a floor amendment to HB 208 on Tuesday that added some clarifying language and stipulated that the prohibition is for instructional time, with a few exceptions, Bray said.\nTeachers would be allowed to authorize cell phone use for an instructional purpose, and students would be allowed to use their phones during an emergency, he added.\nThe legislation would also direct the school districts to block access to social media websites on school computers and school internet networks.\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, said cell phone usage is not a major issue at the elementary school where she works, but she knows HB 208 would help middle and high schools greatly.\nShe said she knows of a school in Louisville where a prohibition policy was recently implemented successfully.\n\"In the first two weeks of school, more books were checked out in the library than in the entire previous year,\" Bojanowski said. \"… I appreciate this legislation, and I strongly support it.\"\nRep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, said one of his children is a \"pretty strong advocate\" against HB 208. He said his child worries how the bill might impact her ability to contact her parents during an emergency.\nBray said there is \"a clear exception\" for emergencies within the bill.\nAull said he would vote in-favor of the legislation, despite his daughter's opposition, since the bill would allow a student to use a cell phone during an emergency.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, said she is also not going to be \"very popular\" with her children by voting in favor of HB 208, but she believes it is the right thing to do.\n\"I want them focused on learning while they are there,\" she said, adding she believes the legislation will improve behavioral issues at schools as well.\nThe Kentucky House of Representatives unanimously approved HB 208 on Tuesday by a 98-0 vote. It will now go before the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Horse racing, bourbon and film? With Senate Bill 1, filmmaking could become another one of Kentucky's signature industries.\nThe House Economic Development and Workforce Investment Committee advanced the legislation on Tuesday. SB 1 is sponsored by Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, and Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester.\nWheeler said Kentucky has had some of the most generous tax credits on the books for television and filmmakers for years, but they're being underutilized.\n\"Here in Kentucky, with our natural landscape, our friendly people and endless potential, I think that we can take Kentucky film production to the next level,\" Wheeler said.\nSB 1 would create the Kentucky Film Office within the state Cabinet for Economic Development. Wheeler said Kentucky has the potential to produce a blockbuster hit, and the office would set up the proper infrastructure to support that type of filmmaking.\n\"The film office will have certain duties. Most importantly, it will basically create a website and the infrastructure necessary to attract these types of feature films to the Commonwealth of Kentucky,\" Wheeler said. \"In addition, there will be a Kentucky Film Leadership Council made up of people in the industry, folks from the economic development cabinet, people that know how to bring the film industry and make it successful in this commonwealth.\"\nIn Georgia, filmmakers have access to a state-ran website where they can look at all the potential filming locations and access information on permitting, among other things. Wheeler said Kentucky is currently missing that key component, but SB 1 would fix that.\nThere are some critics who feel SB 1 would only help bigger Kentucky cities like Lexington and Louisville. Wheeler said he disagrees, using an upcoming Netflix film that was produced in Louisa as an example.\n\"There are places that this bill will have an application way beyond Louisville and Lexington, but if it helps Louisville and Lexington, great,\" Wheeler said. \"If one area of the commonwealth succeeds, we all succeed.\"\nRep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, asked why there is a need for a separate board to get this initiative running.\nStivers said he's worked on SB 1 for a few years, and through his research and conversations with the cabinet, he's learned filmmaking is an industry where networking and having certain connections are valuable.\n\"Secretary (Jeff) Noel said we really don't have that type of mindset and network within our cabinet, but give us a tool, then we will be able to go to a different level, as Sen. Wheeler said,\" Stivers said. \"Working with the cabinet – and they did have input on this – this is the product we get.\"\nStivers and Wheeler said SB 1 has the potential to boost Kentucky's economy. Rep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, asked how the tax incentives may impact local economies.\n\"What is the local impact in terms of growing workforce, growing small businesses or ancillary benefits like that\" she asked.\nCiting a 2022 University of Louisville study, Wheeler said the Kentucky film, motion picture and recording industry generated about $200 million in revenue.\n\"Which they estimated helped other businesses earn approximately $128 million as a result of that, and approximately $27 million was paid in federal, state and local taxes,\" he said.\nStivers said the transient room tax will help fund the office.\n\"The way this is funded is taking up to $500,000 from the transient room tax. They generate $2.5 million a year,\" he said.\nAndrew McNeil with the Kentucky Forum for Rights, Economics and Education, asked the committee to vote against SB 1 due to the tax incentive provisions in the legislation.\n\"These are handouts,\" he said, adding he doesn't believe the bill will boost Kentucky's economy, but will instead use taxpayer money to subsidize the film industry.\nStivers said the system is set up to monitor and ensure the filmmaking industry will make a true investment in Kentucky's economy.\n\"If the people come in from out of state and they pay a wage here, they have to pay income tax here,\" Stivers said. \"That's how you generate that type of return and payment back.\"\nThe House Economic Development and Workforce Investment Committee approved SB 1 by a 17-0 vote with one pass vote.\nThe bill will now go before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments would find its way back to the Kentucky State Capitol grounds if House Joint Resolution 15 is adopted.\nOn Monday, lawmakers on the Senate State and Local Government Committee advanced HJR 15 with an 8-1-1 vote. Rep. Shane Baker, R-Somerset, and Rep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, testified in favor of the measure.\n\"This resolution basically does three things: It directs the Historic Properties Advisory Commission to retrieve the monument. It directs them to return that monument to the State Capitol grounds and place it in monument park, then to simply maintain the display,\" Baker, primary sponsor of the resolution, testified.\nThe State Capitol Monument Park includes the Kentucky Organ Donor Monument and the Kentucky COVID Memorial, among others.\nBaker said there's a long history and tradition of public monuments and displays that acknowledge the role and significance of the Ten Commandments and the role they've played in the history of the United States.\nThe Kentucky State Aerie of the Fraternal Order of Eagles donated the moment to Kentucky in 1971. It remained on permanent display until the 1980s, when it was moved to storage amid a construction project.\nLawmakers passed a resolution to return the display in 2000. However, a court prohibited the enforcement of the resolution, and the monument was returned it to the Fraternal Order of Eagles in Hopkinsville.\nIn 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the exhibition of an essentially identical monument at the Texas State Capitol, Baker said, arguing that the court has resolved legal issues around such displays.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, said she's a Christian who grew up in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and still attends church on a regular basis. But she cast a pass vote and said she had concerns about making sure other beliefs are represented at the Capitol.\n\"I'm just curious as to why specifically the Ten Commandments, and if we were to do something like that, what are we going to do to ensure other religions like Buddhism, Muslims, other faiths have a presence here at our Capitol,\" she asked.\nBaker said the resolution isn't about religious displays; it's about returning a historic monument to the Capitol grounds.\n\"Anyone's welcome to, if they so desire, to go in the future and file bills or resolutions in that vein to do exactly what you're talking about, but that's not what we're trying to do today,\" he said.\nPetrie said there have been similar questions posed by House members during this legislative session.\n\"This deals with a particular historical event, and also a particular monument with particular reasons that endured or suffered through a particular set of Supreme Court cases and tests that, over decades, became obsolete,\" he said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said she's a person of faith, and she appreciates the helpful information included in the resolution. However, she voted against the measure, saying that, after reading the key legal cases, it is not clear that returning the display would pass the new legal test.\n\"I'm worried we're opening ourselves up to litigation that could be very costly, and I think there's a lot of legal uncertainty. I recognize this is a very fast-changing landscape,\" she said.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, spoke briefly as he voted for the measure.\n\"I just think that the Ten Commandments are historical documents, almost kind of a secular code of conduct, very fitting to place them here,\" he said.\nLawmakers prepare bills for a final push next week\nFRANKFORT — The 2025 legislative session is winding closer to sine die, and a heap of legislation is stacked up near the goal post after lawmakers worked into the evening this week to count votes and polish up bills for final action in the coming days.\nMajor bills on college sports, campus diversity programs, learner's permits, government efficiency, freestanding birthing centers and Kentucky's film industry were all gaining ground throughout the week, along with a late-breaking proposal on cannabis-infused drinks.\nThe beverages bill – Senate Bill 202 – calls for state regulations on intoxicating drinks derived from cannabis that have begun appearing in gas stations and vape shops.\nIt would grant the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control authority over the licensing, distribution, and retail sale of cannabis-infused beverages, using a three-tier system similar to the one for alcohol. The legislation would also limit the amount of intoxicating cannabinoids in such drinks – sometimes referred to as \"weed water.\"\nSB 202 cleared a committee vote late Wednesday and passed off the Senate floor Friday after the sponsor removed a moratorium on the sale of such products that had appeared in an earlier version of the bill.\nProponents said the products are not approved by the FDA and that additional oversight is needed to protect consumers, particularly children, from exposure to THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis. Critics largely agreed that regulations are needed, but said they would like to take more time to work through the proposal.\nThe bill now heads to the House.\nMeanwhile, one of the most watched bills from this year's session – House Bill 4 – has been sent to the Senate.\nThe measure would prohibit diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at public postsecondary institutions. Specifically, it would forbid differential treatment in hiring, admissions, scholarships and other areas based on religion, race, sex, color or national origin.\nAmong several other provisions, the bill would also prevent campuses from requiring or incentivizing students to in participate in D.E.I. training, and it would prohibit institutions from using resources on D.E.I. training, offices and initiatives.\nThe legislation cleared the House Committee on Postsecondary Education on Tuesday and advanced off the House floor Wednesday 81-18 following impassioned debate over the impact of D.E.I. initiatives on students and staff.\nHB 4 has been assigned to the Senate Education Committee for potential action next week.\nAmid all the debates, two of the Senate's priority bills have continued to move forward with relative ease.\nSenate Bill 1 would establish the Kentucky Film Office to administer the state's film incentive program, help market the state to the film industry and develop workforce training. The bill cleared the Senate on Tuesday with a unanimous vote.\nSenate Bill 3, which would update Kentucky's name, image and likeness law for college athletes, also cleared the Senate floor Tuesday without opposition and moved out of the House Committee on Economic Development and Workforce Investment on Thursday.\nThe legislation would align Kentucky's law – adopted in 2022 – with national standards, particularly in the aftermath of the House v. NCAA court case, which could open the door to universities directly compensating student athletes.\nIn addition, a long-discussed measure on freestanding birthing centers has won renewed support in the House.\nHouse Bill 90 would create a legal framework for freestanding birthing centers to operate in Kentucky. The House Committee on Licensing, Occupations, and Administrative Regulations passed the bill Wednesday, and it cleared the House on Thursday 82-9.\nThe general assembly has debated the issue for years, but the concept appears to be gaining support for a potential breakthrough in 2025, and a similar measure has already passed the Senate.\nMany other bills were on the move this week. Here's a look at some of the legislation making headway:\nSquatting – House Bill 10 seeks to crack down on squatting by providing a more concrete procedure for property owners and law enforcement to quickly remove unauthorized occupants from private property. It would also spell out criminal penalties for squatters who damage property. The House passed the legislation Tuesday.\nFinancial Literacy – House Bill 342 would require high school students to earn one credit in a financial literacy course before graduation. The bill cleared the House on Tuesday.\nGift Card Scams – Under Senate Bill 130, individuals who tamper with gift cards with the intention to steal funds could face a class D felony charge. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday.\nGovernment Efficiency – Senate Bill 257 would create the Office of Government Efficiency within the state auditor's office. The agency would evaluate and make recommendations to improve the efficiency and performance of state offices and programs. The bill cleared the Senate State and Local Government Committee on Monday and the Senate floor on Wednesday.\nTerroristic Threatening – Under House Bill 621, parents could face fines if their children are adjudicated for terroristic threatening and the threat caused law enforcement to incur an excessive cost during the response. The House Primary and Secondary Education Committee passed the measure Wednesday.\nLearner's Permits – House Bill 15 would reduce the minimum age for getting a learner's permit in Kentucky from 16 to 15 years old.

If lawmakers want a chance to override potential vetoes from the governor, they will need to finalized legislation by March 14.\nKentuckians can track the action this year through Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky lawmakers say cannabis-infused beverages – sometimes known as \"weed water\" – have been on their radar since last September. On Friday, the Senate advanced a bill that would seek to regulate the products.\nSenate Bill 202 calls for cannabis-infused beverages to fall under the authority of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control for the purposes of licensing, distribution, and retail sales. The bill proposes using a three-tier system similar to the one for alcohol.\nThe bill's sponsor, Sen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, said there has been proliferation of the products at gas stations, liquor stores and vape shops recently.\n\"These cannabis-infused beverages are the result of a loophole in the 2018 federal farm bill that reauthorized the growing of hemp in our country. It didn't take long for someone to quickly figure out you can extract the THC and that's the delta-9 and put it in a whole host of products,\" she said.\nThe Senate advanced the bill with a 29-6 vote, and it now heads to the House.\nThe legislation spells out what qualifies as a \"cannabis-infused\" beverage. According to the bill, it is a properly permitted, adult-use cannabinoid liquid intended for human consumption that has intoxicating properties that change the function of the nervous system and result in alterations of perception, cognition or behavior.\nSB 202 would limit the level of intoxicating cannabinoids in the drinks to 5 milligrams. Adams said one manufacturer states on the company's website that a 10-milligram beverage can is equal to four glasses of wine or four shots of 80 proof vodka.\nAdams said there are several cannabinoid products that have nonintoxicating properties, and the bill is silent on all of them. It also doesn't contain a tax provision because it's unconstitutional for the Senate to impose a new tax or revenue measure.\nOne provision of the bill calls on the University of Kentucky Cannabis Center to study and report to the legislature on the manufacturing, testing procedures, distribution, sale and consumer effects of cannabis-infused beverages.\nCritics of the bill agreed that some level of regulation is needed for the beverages, but they raised concerns about uncertainties in the proposal's language.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, voted no on the bill, and said it's possible some of the products might seem to have a higher level of THC, but have fewer intoxicating effects.\n\"I think that most everyone would agree there's got to be regulations in place. I'm all for that. I think they should be regulated, taxed and made sure that we continue to put sections in place that only adults are getting these beverages,\" he said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said the industry is now legal, and legislators should hear from stakeholders so there won't be unintended consequences from enacted legislation.\nBut Sen. Gary Boswell, R-Owensboro, said products with THC that exceed federal law should be confiscated.\n\"If you give them an inch, they'll take a mile. Suddenly, the products that exceed the federal law on THC content have flooded our market. I believe that all these illegal products should be confiscated. No bill's perfect,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky House of Representatives advanced a bill on Friday that would make interference of legislative proceedings a misdemeanor in most circumstances.\nRep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 399. He said the bill is the result of an incident from the 2023 legislative session where protestors in the House gallery caused a loud disruption that impeded the legislature's ability to do its job.\n\"(The bill) will ensure that the general assembly has an opportunity to legislate without interference from people who wish to prevent us from doing our work on behalf of our constituents,\" Blanton said.\nBlanton said the executive branch and judicial branches of state government have similar powers when it comes to curtailing certain disruptions.\n\"Judges have the power to deal with interruptions in their courtroom by use of criminal contempt proceedings,\" Blanton said as an example of how the bill would give the legislature similar protections.\nUnder HB 399, a person would be guilty of second-degree interference of a legislative proceeding if they enter or remain inside a chamber or gallery of the general assembly or another room being used for the general assembly with the intent to impede or prevent the legislature from conducting business.\nThe second-degree provision would also apply if a person obstructs or impedes a legislator, legislative officer or legislative staff member from movement within a legislative building.\nSecond-degree interference of a legislative proceeding would be a class B misdemeanor on the first offense and a class A misdemeanor on the second or subsequent offense.\nA person would be guilty of first-degree interference of a legislative proceeding if they knowingly engage, conspire, or facilitate another person to engage in disorderly or disruptive conduct in a legislative building or they personally disrupt, impede or prevent the general assembly from conducting business, Blanton said.\nFirst-degree interference of a legislative proceeding would be a class A misdemeanor until the third or subsequent offense. Violators would then face a class D felony charge.\nAn earlier version of HB 399 called for a class D felony at the second or subsequent offense. The House adopted a floor amendment from Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, on Friday that changed that provision to read \"third\" instead of second.\n\"I would hope a third offense never happens … However, I think that having that third offense in is a preferable way to do it,\" Roberts said.\nRoberts's amendment would also clarify that nothing in the legislation could be construed to prohibit the public from assembling in traditional public forums in the Capitol Rotunda, Capitol grounds or other areas of the Kentucky State Capitol campus.\nThe provision is essential \"to ensure we are focused on the areas where we are conducting the people's business,\" he said.\nAdditionally, the amendment clarifies that a peace officer may arrest violators and remove violators at the request of the Speaker of the House, sergeant-at-arms, Senate President or committee chair.\nBlanton said he does not intend for HB 399 to impede on constitutional rights.\n\"This is the people's house,\" he said. \"They have the right to come here and protest. That's their First Amendment right.\"\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, said there are times when constituents travel to Frankfort to testify in a committee or speak to their legislator and are unable to. When that happens, those people are often frustrated and use their voice in other ways in order to be heard.\n\"But for people not be able to speak appropriately, and then be criminalized for using their voice here, I don't believe that's right,\" Donworth said. \"I don't believe that's what our founders intended, and I would ask people to please vote 'no' on this.\"\nAs the chair of the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee. Rep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said he tries to make sure everyone's viewpoint is heard during a committee meeting, but time or circumstances do not always allow for that.\nHe said constituents have the right to visit and contact their legislator, advocate for an issue and have access to legislation and meetings, but nothing guarantees that a constituent can speak during a committee meeting.\n\"We all agree that people should get involved in the process, and the best way to encourage that is to try to give people time to speak. But, again, I cannot emphasize enough that nothing in the process guarantees your right to speak in committee,\" Gooch said.\nHB 399 advanced off the House floor by a 68-26 vote. It now heads to the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A resolution to create a task force to examine executive branch spending advanced from the House State Government Committee on Thursday.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R- Burlington, and Rep. John Hodgson, R-Fisherville, are the primary co-sponsors of House Concurrent Resolution 50.\n\"House Concurrent Resolution 50 establishes the Kentucky Discipline of Government Efficiency Task Force, which is an interim committee to examine our financial practices, particularly the executive branch,\" Roberts said. \"Further, the (resolution) makes clear that our focus will be on the transition to zero-based budgeting.\"\nAccording to the legislation, the 10-member task force, also known as KY DOGE, would meet at least twice a month during the 2025 interim of the Kentucky General Assembly. The task force's findings would be considered in the biennial budget drafting process in 2026.\nThe resolution would require the task force to report its findings no later than Oct. 1, 2025.\nRoberts said the KY DOGE Task Force would \"ensure that when we are spending the people's money through our tax system, that it is done in an efficient manner.\"\nHodgson said he spent four years during former Gov. Matt Bevin's administration working on a similar effort that was successful.\n\"In the span of four years, we were able to cut out 200 unneeded boards and commissions,\" Hodgson said. \"We downsized the workforce by about 10% — more than 3,000 people — without any reduction in service … The government not only survived, but was doing better at the end of that process. I think there are many more opportunities.\"\nCommittee chair Rep. David Hale, R-Wellington, asked who would make up the 10 members of the committee.\nRoberts said there would be four House Republicans, four Senate Republicans, one House Democrat and one Senate Democrat on the task force.\n\"This would compose it similar to what the partisan make up of our current body is,\" Roberts said, adding the members would be appointed through the regular committee appointment process.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly has budget review subcommittees that meet throughout the year to examine certain areas of the budget, like education and transportation spending. Rep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, asked Roberts and Hodgson how the KY DOGE Task Force would be different from that subcommittee process.\nRoberts said the focus of the task force would be to examine the funding base.\n\"The budget review subcommittees, they are focusing on specific parts of the budget that we are already voting on, that we are already having legislative oversight,\" he added.\nLehman said a legislative report from 2001 on zero-based budgeting compared to performance based-budgeting already exists.\n\"I'm just not exactly sure what (the task force) is going to accomplish that isn't being accomplished by the current budget process and our interim joint budget review subcommittees,\" he added.\nRep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, said that as the former chair for the Budget Review Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education, he believes the task force would be helpful.\n\"Nobody ever looks at what's in the base,\" Tipton said. \"And the question is, are there things in that base that maybe aren't working? If they're working well, if they're providing services, we need to keep them.\n\"But if there are things in that base that are not productive, that are not beneficial to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, maybe we need to cut them out and reinvest those funds in areas where they can truly benefit the commonwealth.\"\nHCR 50 advanced from the House State Government Committee by a 16-3 vote with one pass vote. It now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that seeks to lower the age to carry concealed deadly weapons in Kentucky was green lighted Thursday during a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting.\nSponsored by Sen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, Senate Bill 75 would lower the age requirement from 21 to 18. He said the bill is about fairness, constitutional rights and the ability of young adults to protect themselves just like any other law-abiding citizen.\n\"At 18-years-old, a Kentuckian is legally an adult. They can vote. They can sign contracts. They can marry. They can be tried as an adult in court, and most importantly, they can serve in the United States military,\" Reed said.\nReed said the current age requirement is an \"unjust double standard, one that must be corrected.\"\nSome people may argue that lowering the conceal carry age would make it easier for kids to get guns, but the bill doesn't change who can legally purchase a firearm, Reed said.\n\"Federal law still applies. Background checks still apply. Nothing in this bill weakens or changes our existing gun purchasing laws. It simply ensures that those who are already legally allowed to own a firearm are given the same rights to carry it responsibly, just as they would at 21,\" he said.\nReed testified that in January, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it's unconstitutional to deny 18 to 20-year-olds the right to purchase firearms.\n\"If we acknowledge that they have the right to own a firearm, then why are we denying them the ability to carry one for their own protection?\"\nAlso testifying in favor of the bill was Taylor McKee of the National Rifle Association.\n\"Young adults 18-20 are among the people protected by the Second Amendment, and they should not be barred or discriminated against from carrying firearms for self-defense,\" he said.\nSpeaking against the measure was Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah. He asked if 18-year-olds and military members can openly carry deadly weapons. McKee answered yes, eliciting a response from Carroll.\n\"I think it's important to note that I personally do not see anything to gain by passing this bill, and that's from 24 years of law enforcement officer,\" he said.\nCarroll also said he's a supporter of the Second Amendment, but was concerned when training requirements were eliminated from Kentucky's concealed carry law several years ago.\n\"My entire adult life as a law enforcement officer, I was trained regularly to know how and when to shoot that gun,\" he said. \"The idea of people carrying a concealed weapon who may not even know how to shoot that weapon is terrifying. And I think we went too far there, and I think this is another step where we had gone too far.\"\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals made clear that states could implement different rules for certain ages regarding how the weapons are carried, training requirements and the qualifications to purchase them.\n\"We're not required by that Fifth Circuit decision to say that 18-year-olds can carry concealed weapons. Kentucky could still differentiate that Fifth Circuit decision between 18 and 20-year-olds in terms of having the rights to carry concealed weapons,\" he asked McKee, who confirmed it would not be binding.\nSenate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, spoke in favor of the bill, explaining how his father and uncles served in the military when they were young, along with his 19-year-old son who left college after two years to enlist in the Marine Corps.\n\"I think those instances show that we have within the recognition of the United States government and the state government that teenagers are able to defend our country,\" he said. \"And therefore, they should be able to purchase a weapon and carry it as any other adult because at 18, our laws recognize them as such.\"\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A measure that calls for accountability and transparency in state government advanced out of the Kentucky Senate on Wednesday with a 32-6 vote.\nSenate Bill 257 would create the Office of Government Efficiency within the state auditor's office to conduct performance audits and fiscal reviews of state agencies, according to the bill's sponsor, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield.\n\"This bill is a continuing effort of fiscal responsibility. Since 2016, the general assembly has implemented fiscally conservative principles and policies that have led to the largest surplus in state history,\" Tichenor said.\nThe measure also calls for monitoring implementation of efficiency-related recommendations and reporting findings annually to the governor and the Legislative Research Commission, she said.\nSB 257 would provide the state auditor's office with access to certain restricted funds for hiring staff as necessary. Long-term funding would come through appropriations from the general assembly and through any federal grants earmarked for government efficiency, Tichenor said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, spoke against the measure, stating that the state needs Kentucky solutions to Kentucky problems.\n\"My concerns with this bill start, although they don't end, with the title. And I know a title is just words, but these are words that have been intentionally chosen to invoke what is happening in Washington, D.C. under the federal DOGE program,\" she said.\nChambers Armstrong said when she looks at the bill, it makes her think that the goal of the legislation is to bring that \"same chaos\" to Kentucky.\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, said he was also concerned that the general assembly is copying the federal government. However, he suggested that the federal government look at what Kentucky has done.\n\"The feds need to look at us. And like the senator from Jefferson also said, this is something that isn't new, but it hasn't been utilized since auditor Crit Luallen, a Democrat, years ago. She was touted for what she did because she did a great job. We again want to do that great job,\" he said.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, voted against the bill and said the federal Department of Government Efficiency is politically charged.\n\"And what's come out of it we've seen in the last four months is chaos, confusion, a loss of jobs and uncertainty and a great deal of social unrest. I would not like to see that duplicated here in Kentucky,\" he said.\nHowever, Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, said the efforts would be a good use of money, and the state auditor's office is different than the federal one.\n\"The auditor is a constitutional officer. She has, or he has, a constitutional authority to do something and we, I think as a legislature, have a constitutional responsibility to fund that function that the auditor has,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads to the House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that would lower the age for youth to acquire an instruction permit for driving unanimously cleared the Senate Transportation Committee on Wednesday.\nHouse Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy, R-Paducah, said the proposed legislation would allow teenagers to get a permit once they turn 15. At age 16, they would be eligible to take a driver's test for an intermediate permit if they have had at least six months of training.\nRudy said some young people might choose to delay or decline to get a driver's license, but for many young people, these aren't options.\n\"I think a lot of parents will say I'm better off getting an Uber or a Lyft for my kid than getting another car and taking out that insurance. And that's fine if they want to do that. But those kids, particularly in rural Kentucky that don't have those third-party ride platforms, I think this is going to be good experience for them,\" he said.\nRudy brought Brooks Young, a 14-year-old boy from Franklin County, who testified that he's excited about learning how to drive and become more independent.\n\"I'm here on behalf of every soon-to-be 15-year-old in Kentucky. House Bill 15 is an opportunity to provide significant benefits to our communities, families and businesses in every Kentucky county,\" he said.\nMany 15-year-olds are already balancing school work, part-time jobs, sports and activities. This demonstrates their ability to manage their time, Young said.\n\"Allowing them to begin driving under controlled, safe and structured conditions offers an opportunity to further develop these crucial life skills,\" he said. \"House Bill 15 would boost the local workforce. Teens who are able to drive will be more likely to access job opportunities and contribute to the economy.\"\nAllowing teens to get their permits at 15 would also provide more chances for the parents to guide, monitor and teach, Young added.\nRudy said the bill would maintain the intermediate license process for 16-year-olds. Drivers could apply for a full operator's license at 17 if they have held an intermediate license for 180 days.\nSen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, said he is in favor of 15-year-old youth having the opportunity to drive, and allowing this will bring Kentucky in line with surrounding states. He also said he hopes the measure will help energize young people to want to get driver's licenses.\n\"I too drove at 15 years old when I was growing up. I didn't have any problems or any issues,\" he said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said she has two little boys, and the thought of them driving before they reach the age of 30 gives her heart palpitations.\n\"However, what I like about this bill is I like the added training requirements. But I do believe that allowing our young people more opportunities to learn will make them safer drivers when they are eventually out on their own,\" she said.\nSen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, thanked Rudy for the bill and spoke in favor of it.\n\"My son's going to turn 16 next month, and I just wish we could have passed this last year so he would have a full year of experience driving,\" he said.\nCommittee Chair Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, said it's important to give the driver licensing regional offices help to deal with the influx of 15-year-olds who seek to drive.\n\"It will put an extra strain on our regional offices to get these permits out. We have legislation coming your way. Please watch for that and help us out on this,\" he told Rudy.\nRudy responded that he and others have been in contact with staff of the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet.\n\"We hear them loud and clearly. The regional driver's license has been an issue that I think everybody acknowledges. I also think that's going to work itself out in time, but we're looking at ways we can help get through this period of backlog and hopefully take care of this,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Parents of children adjudicated for terroristic threatening could be fined under House Bill 621.\nThe House Primary and Secondary Education Committee advanced the legislation on Wednesday. Rep. Robert Duvall, R-Bowling Green, is the primary sponsor of the bill.\n\"House Bill 621 simply allows the courts the option to impose a fine to the parents of the child based upon the determination that law enforcement incurred excessive cost responding to the offense,\" Duvall said. \"It also puts the child in contact with the mental health professional.\"\nStudies show that disengaged or negligent parents are often the cause for delinquency and minors committing major crimes, Duvall said.\n\"This will create a safer society we can all be proud of. But when parents are not parenting, they must be held accountable,\" he added. \"And House Bill 621 does just that.\"\nSteve Chappell, who serves as the Warren County Safe Schools Administrator through the Warren County Sheriff's Office, testified alongside Duvall.\nHe told the committee that threats against schools \"spread like wildfire\" and require a lot of resources to investigate.\n\"I have to pull resources from other schools to go to that school the threat was directed at and that leaves our other schools vulnerable,\" Chappell said. \"Not only that, if it's an online threat, we have to track down who the user was, what the handle was, and then we have to get federal agencies involved a lot of times. FBI and Homeland Security assist us with that.\"\nChappell said more tools are needed when it comes holding people accountable for terroristic threatening against schools.\n\"With this bill, I think that it would help,\" he added. \"… This would hold the parents accountable to some degree as far as checking their students' phones and seeing what they're looking at.\"\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, asked if there are any other state laws that fine parents for a crime their child commits. Duvall said he wasn't aware of any.\nRep. Josh Calloway, R-Irvington, said he had the same question as Bojanowski and some other concerns about the bill.\nCalloway said he worries the bill doesn't take into consideration parents of adopted children or foster children who are dealing with reactive attachment disorder and other parents who are aware and actively helping their child.\n\"It just seems like (the bill's language) is extremely open and allows for just a lot of leeway in the judicial system to decide what they think, instead of us telling them specifically in statute this is how you can charge and when you can charge,\" Calloway said.\nDuvall said HB 621 is not a mandate.\n\"This legislation would simply allow the courts to look at this as an option,\" he said. \"… This is not a 'shall' it is a 'may.'\"\nRep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, also had concerns about the language of the legislation. She said she understands terroristic threatening in schools is a serious issue, but asked about \"the child shall be detained\" provision and if it would allow for diversion programs.\nDuvall said his intent for the bill would be for the child to be assessed by a mental health professional and referred to counseling and other services if needed.\nWillner said she is \"100% behind\" that idea, and asked Duvall if he would be willing to work on an amendment to make that intention clearer in the legislation. Duvall said he would look into that.\nRep. Steve Riley, R-Glasgow, also spoke on the mental health aspect of threats in schools. He told the committee about a student who recently died by suicide in his district who may have been influenced by online behavior.\n\"We're having our young people's lives destroyed because of threats that are being made, whether they be online or at school or whatever they may be,\" Riley said. \"As a society, we've got to start holding people accountable, whether they're teenagers who know better or their parents for activities that harm our students, and in many cases, the people who work at our schools.\"\nThe committee approved HB 621 by a 10-2 vote with five pass votes.\nRep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, said he thinks parents are responsible for the actions of their children.\n\"I think this is a very appropriate first step, and I appreciate you for bringing it Representative Duvall,\" he added.\nHB 621 now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that seeks to boost Kentucky's film industry received unanimous approval from the Senate on Tuesday after supporters said the state's charm and natural beauty provide major draws for filmmaking.\nSen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, said the proposed legislation will centralize efforts to attract movie producers to Kentucky and spur the economy. The Kentucky film, motion picture and sound recording industry generated $200 million in revenues in 2022, and in turn, probably helped other businesses in the state garner another $128 million, he said.\nThe legislation would establish the Kentucky Film Office within the state Cabinet for Economic Development. It would also create the Kentucky Film Leadership Council and call on state tourism, labor and economic development officials to develop comprehensive film industry strategies.\n\"Senate Bill 1 is Kentucky's effort to bring itself to the world through the motion picture film industry. For many years, Kentucky has had in place some of the most generous film tax incentives in the entire country,\" Wheeler said. \"And yet we have not fully taken advantage of a job employment and economic opportunities that film production has for the commonwealth.\"\nAt the heart of the bill is a centralized infrastructure plan to capitalize on the full potential of film production. The film office would serve as a hub for marketing, industry coordination, and workforce development and solidify Kentucky's position as an attractive destination for film production, he said.\n\"A dedicated Kentucky film office will help maximize incentives, track major productions and remove unnecessary roadblocks for filmmakers. And why do we know this will bring economic success in Kentucky? We've seen other examples, perhaps most notably Georgia, which has formed a multi-billion-dollar industry based upon film production as well as film tourism,\" Wheeler said.\nStaff at the film office would work closely with local and regional film offices and tourism offices to streamline permitting and market Kentucky as a prime location for film production.\nThey also would assist the state's production companies in navigating the Kentucky Entertainment Incentive Program and facilitate the development of a skilled workforce in collaboration with film studios and training programs, he said.\nAlso speaking in favor of the measure was bill co-sponsor Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester. He shared stories with other legislators about naysayers, but said Kentucky is in fact drawing interest from filmmakers.\nStivers pointed out that Asbury University in Wilmore is probably one of the leading postsecondary institutions in the nation for steering people to pursue careers in film and television production.\nHe said he received calls over the weekend from people on the west coast who want to negotiate coming to Kentucky to work.\n\"What more can we do for creating an environment for diversification, education and economic development than creating a coordinating body that the secretary and his staff and us as policy makers recognize as quite the viable entity to project us into a realm that we have not been in and been competitive because we lack this structure,\" he said.\nSen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, called the measure a \"workforce attraction\" bill and perhaps one of the biggest things the legislature will do for decades.\n\"This is an invitation to all of our Kentuckians to find a place, to find a home,\" she said mentioning that many people in the film industry work in support roles and aren't actors.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said her house was used for filming last January. Sixty-five people in a crew filmed scenes for an upcoming movie featuring Al Pacino.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, added that in 1992, there were nearly 800 people in Henderson and Evansville filming \"A League of Their Own,\" and it had a tremendous economic impact on Hendersonville and the tri-state area.\n\"I want to thank the senators for their sponsorship of this and look forward to the growth in tourism to come,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads to the House.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Senate Families and Children Committee unanimously approved a bill Tuesday that would require Kentucky's public school districts to implement policies for using only traceable forms of communication between staff, coaches, and volunteers and their students.\nSen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, testified during a meeting that Senate Bill 181 would put standards in place that protect the education profession and the proper relationships between students and those in authority. It would also return previously existing safeguards that protect children and their families, she said.\nTichenor asked committee members to recall their adolescent years and the old communication methods they most likely used. She said the lines that delineated proper relationships between authority and students have been diminished.\n\"Can you imagine or think of a time when a school volunteer or a teacher or a coach called you up just to chat privately? How would that have gone over with your family? Probably not well. It would have been quite awkward,\" she said.\nTichenor said she has a stack of concerning stories in a folder from Kentucky counties.\n\"And they're just a sampling of a few that make it into the news, and I will tell you, it crosses our state entirely,\" she said.\nUnder SB 181, employees and volunteers would be required to report known direct, private communications at which point parents would be notified and the district will proceed with the appropriate action, Tichenor testified.\nThere's also a provision in the bill that would protect the anonymity of minors during an investigation by the Education Professional Standards Board. SB 181 would also extend the time for investigations of a sexual nature to 120 days, Tichenor said.\nStacy Briscoe of Anderson County testified in favor of the bill, stating that her then-16-year-old daughter had interactions with an employee at Anderson County High School without parental consent. The communication included several text messages, she said.\n\"Please, put yourself in our parental shoes. Completely oblivious to an adult having unlimited, uncensored contact with our minor child,\" Briscoe said.\nAshley Nation also testified, and said she is not only an advocate for student safety, but also a survivor of educator sexual abuse.\n\"As a student, I was targeted by a teacher who used in-person and electronic communications to groom and manipulate me. What began as seemingly harmless conversations and messages soon escalated into a situation where I felt trapped, vulnerable and unable to seek help,\" she said.\nSen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, said she's an active volunteer in the Roman Catholic program, Protecting God's Children. She said abuse of students is a terrible problem, and asked where the term traceable communication is defined.\n\"We actually have that defined in the bill, but we will clarify that a little bit as well,\" Tichenor said. \"Traceable communication could be old-school, like a parent's note, a communication that's on paper that can be traced. Email can be traceable, and there are so many apps they use these days...\"\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, asked Tichenor if she knows if schools already have policies about communications between school employees and students.\n\"There are some ethical standards, but I'm not seeing that they're being followed or they're not being disciplined if they're not being followed,\" she said.\nSen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, asked Tichenor if there's a requirement, for example, for a teacher to report another teacher if direct communication is observed. He asked if it would fall under the requirement to report.\n\"It absolutely would, and we do specify in the language of the bill that if someone knows that there's direct communication happening, they have a duty to report that,\" she said.\nSen. Matthew Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, commented about platforms teachers use for communication and said he is in favor of the bill.\n\"The bill that you put together says that they must have one, and that's an issue that I would say that I would like to see addressed a little bit wider in this bill because there are multiple platforms out there that are trackable that schools use from their athletic department to their teachers,\" he said.\nTichenor said there will be a floor amendment to address the platforms.\nSen. Rick Girdler, R-Somerset, said he could have been convinced of anything in high school, and he would have been willing to run into a wall if his coach asked him to do it.\n\"I thank God every day that I was raised in the 50s and 60s, not in the 20s. But we send our kids to get an education, not to be abused or used,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that would prohibit diversity, equity and inclusion (D.E.I.) initiatives at public postsecondary institutions cleared its first hurdle in the 2025 legislative session.\nThe House Postsecondary Education Committee advanced House Bill 4 on Tuesday. Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said the measure would end an unconstitutional practice in Kentucky and make public postsecondary education more accessible for all students. She is the primary sponsor of the legislation.\nDecker said HB 4 would \"ensure our postsecondary system in Kentucky is held accountable\" and would \"dismantle the failed and misguided D.E.I. bureaucracies that have made our colleges more divided, more expensive and less tolerant.\"\nHB 4 is the result of a 2023 Supreme Court ruling on the issue, Decker added.\nFor public postsecondary institutions, HB 4 would:\nThe Council on Postsecondary Education would also be prohibited from implementing D.E.I. initiatives.\nDecker said HB 4 would not threaten student centers.\n\"Critics misread this bill as threatening student centers and threatening support for veterans, first generation and low-income students – services that are explicitly and groups that are explicitly exempted from this bill,\" Decker said.\nTo ensure compliance, HB 4 would require the state auditor of public accounts to set up a process to review whether public institutions are abiding by the statute, Committee chair Rep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, said.\nThe review would take place every four years, and institutions would have 180 days to correct any violations.\n\"If the institution fails to cure the violation within that time, the institution shall be ineligible to receive formula funding increases … during the following fiscal year,\" Tipton said. \"There's also an ability for the institution to petition the attorney general if they disagree with the auditor on the issue.\"\nDecker said the goal of HB 4 is to foster critical thinking at public postsecondary institutions and correct a 14-year drop in enrollment from low income and underrepresented students.\n\"If education is to be the great equalizer in the commonwealth, the opportunity to obtain a college degree in our state must be equally available and affordable to all,\" she said.\nRep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, said it is \"a broad leap\" to suggest D.E.I. is the cause for a drop in enrollment among underrepresented students.\n\"If the D.E.I. initiatives are leaving some folks out, why don't we make these more inclusive rather than just get rid of them?\" she asked.\nDecker replied that she doesn't think D.E.I. caused a drop in enrollment, but it hasn't helped the issue either.\n\"If I were paying millions to help something not happen, and then it happened for 14 years, I would stop that spending,\" she added. \"I would be disgusted by the outcomes that I was not getting from what I was paying for.\"\nRep. George Brown Jr., D-Lexington, called HB 4 \"problematic\" and said Kentucky's history of discriminatory practices should be taken into consideration.\n\"The historical indicators of what has occurred, particularly with people who look like me, and other protected classes in our society – it's a really serious problem.\" Brown said. \"And I think we're trivializing it and that we're trying to say that this does not matter.\"\nBrown said he also has concerns about how HB 4 may violate federal Title IX and Title VI law.\nRep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, said he supports HB 4, but wished a private course of action provision in an early version of the bill remained in the current draft.\n\"I would like to see maybe a little more teeth to it, but I think you've done a great job on this,\" Doan said, adding he worries colleges and universities may ignore sections of the bill without the original language.\nThe House Postsecondary Education Committee approved HB 4 by an 11-4 vote.\nIn explaining his \"yes\" vote, Tipton said the debate on HB 4 has distracted from the goal of the legislation: student success.\n\"... We have to work to help every student succeed, no matter their situation in life,\" Tipton said. \"There are many extra wrap-around services that are needed, and that should be our goal. That should be where we focus on helping every student have the opportunity to succeed.\"\nHB 4 now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Senate Health Services Committee advanced a bill Monday that would prohibit discrimination against health care professionals who decline to perform procedures that violate their consciences.\nSen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, called Senate Bill 132 \"commonsense,\" and said the bill would strengthen health care providers' rights and also set up civil remedies for people who feel they've been wronged.\n\"This bill is not a challenge to the social structure. It is not a policy bill. It is not a get out of jail free bill for those who decide that they don't want to fulfill their duties. What this bill is, it is a recruitment tool. It's an economic development tool,\" he said.\nDouglas said the pressure on Kentucky's health care system and those who work in it are tremendous. He said if the health care professionals don't have a choice regarding their sincerely held beliefs, it makes it more difficult for medical facilities to recruit competent health care providers in Kentucky.\n\"It is a tool that basically says welcome to the commonwealth. We really look forward to your business, and even though we expect the highest level of professionalism from you, we will honor your moral conscience as we do for all Kentuckians,\" he said.\nDouglas said there are some medical professionals who don't mind violating their own consciences when they want to complete procedures, but there are those who have strong beliefs. He also said institutions are protected at the federal level, but not individuals.\nThe legislation would give health care professionals the right to refuse to participate in any service that violates their conscience, and it would stipulate that professionals cannot be held, civilly, criminally or administratively liable in those circumstances. It also would prohibit discrimination against such professionals in hiring or licensing.\nSB 132 includes some exceptions, including instances in which health care professionals are required to provide emergency medical treatment or conduct examinations related to sexual assaults.\nThe bill sparked some lengthy debate during Monday's hearing.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, voted against the bill, and said it would lead to discrimination against patients.\n\"I know that we continue to hear the words individual civil rights and religious ethical beliefs. It's just very concerning to me that we continue to pass policy to say that people have individual civil rights basically to discriminate against folks and that we use words 'religious' and 'ethical beliefs' to allow that, so I'm going to be a no on this,\" she said.\nBut Senate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, voted for the measure, arguing that it specifically points out objections to procedures or particular health care services.\nLikewise, Sen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, voted for SB 132.\n\"The way it was described, it's the medical procedure that you can object to, not any person or their belief or what they did to get there,\" he said.\nSen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, concurred with Mills and Nemes.\n\"In the seven or so states that have this on the books, patients have not been turned away. So, it's so much more important to look at track records rather than theoreticals,\" he said.\nSeveral health care professionals and advocates also testified on the bill, including Dr. Miranda Bencomo, a pediatrician who said she strongly opposes the measure.\n\"While I do appreciate the goal of trying to recruit more providers, I fear that this bill does not actually add anything to achieve that goal. Instead, I feel that it opens the door to substandard care by allowing health professionals to deny services based on personal beliefs without accountability,\" she said.\nRepresentatives from the Fairness Campaign and Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates also raised concerns about discrimination in health care settings and exacerbating a shortage of obstetricians and gynecologists.\nHowever, one supporter, Paris physician Dr. Bill Wehrman, said patients would continue to get care if the bill is passed. He said Kentucky lacks specialists, paramedics and other health care workers and that the proposed legislation would provide a boost in attracting professionals to the state.\nRegistered nurse Lindsey Cox testified that her career has been affected by a lack of protection of her beliefs.\n\"As a nurse, when I was deciding what field of specialty I wanted to work in, I changed the direction due to ethical concerns about being forced to participate or being coerced to participate in procedures that would violate my conscience,\" she said.\nThe measure cleared the committee with an 8-1 vote and one pass. It now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nKey bills on NIL, workplace safety and religious liberty move forward\nFRANKFORT — High-profile bills on religious freedom, college athletics and fluoride were all on the move this week as lawmakers passed a wave of bills out of committee and off the chamber floors in preparation for a busy two weeks ahead.\nFriday marked day 20 of this year's short, 30-day session, leaving just eight days on the calendar before the general assembly is scheduled to break for the veto recess. Legislators will need to finalize bills by March 14 if they want a chance to override potential vetoes from the governor.\nThe looming deadline prompted swift action in committee and long afternoons in the chambers throughout the week.\nThe House met for more than four hours Wednesday to clear a slate of 23 bills, and lawmakers passed another 16 off the floor Thursday. Measures on fluoride and workplace conditions proved especially contentious during the proceedings.\nHouse Bill 16 would make water fluoridation programs optional for the governing bodies of local water providers, and lawmakers clashed over the impact of fluoride on both dental and internal health before passing the measure 68-29.\nThe focus then pivoted to differences over occupational safety.\nHouse Bill 398 aims to align Kentucky's workplace safety and health regulations with federal rules. It also calls for limits on Kentucky policies so that they are no more stringent than those on the federal level.\nSupporters said the bill would streamline regulations and make it easier for businesses to locate in Kentucky. However, opponents raised concerns that it would compromise the safety of workers and leave Kentucky subject to uncertainties on the federal level.\nThe bill passed 62-33 and now heads to the Senate.\nFor its part, the upper chamber turned Wednesday to a floor debate over religious liberty and discrimination.\nSenate Bill 60 seeks to reinforce religious liberty protections in Kentucky and clear the way for individuals to sue the government for violations of religious freedom.\nCritics cited concerns that some might use religious protections to justify discrimination. But supporters said the bill is needed to reinforce founding principles and protect religious exercise. The measure cleared the Senate with a 29-7 vote on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, the spotlight shifted to the Senate Education Committee thanks in part to an appearance by Mitch Barnhart, athletics director at the University of Kentucky, and Josh Heird, director of athletics at the University of Louisville.\nBoth testified in support of Senate Bill 3, which would update Kentucky's name, image and likeness law for college athletes. The proposed changes would align Kentucky's law – adopted in 2022 – with national standards, particularly in the aftermath of the House v. NCAA court case.\nA pending settlement in the case could result in universities providing direct compensation to student athletes, and advocates for the bill said Kentucky needs to respond to the evolving landscape. The committee passed the measure Thursday.\nLater in the day, lawmakers also took action on a priority measure designed to boost Kentucky's growing film industry.\nSenate Bill 1 would establish the Kentucky Film Office to administer the state's film incentive program, help market the state to the film industry and develop workforce training. It received a nod from the Senate Economic Development, Tourism and Labor Committee on Thursday.\nMany other measures are edging closer to passage in the legislature. Here is a look at some of the other bills on the move:\nDyslexia Interventions – House Bill 272 would require local boards of education to develop a policy for identifying and assisting students in kindergarten through third grade who have dyslexia. It also calls on the state Department of Education to collect data and annually review and update its guidance on reading and writing difficulties. The measure cleared the House floor on Tuesday.\nElections Security – House Bill 455 would establish the Office of Election Investigations and Security in the Kentucky Attorney General's Office. The agency would review and investigate alleged violations of state election law. The House advanced the bill Tuesday.\nManufactured Housing – House Bill 160 would prohibit local governments from adopting or enforcing zoning regulations that treat manufactured homes differently from site-built homes in single family residential zones. The manufactured homes would still need to meet strict standards for size, age and foundation. The measure won support from the House on Tuesday.\nMoments of Silence in Schools – Senate Bill 19 would require public schools to hold a moment of silence and reflection for students at the start of the school day. The Senate passed the measure Tuesday.\nKEES Scholarships – Senate Bill 83 would expand the Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship program to provide funds for homeschooled students based on their ACT scores. The legislation cleared a Senate floor vote on Tuesday.\nChildhood Hearing Loss – Senate Bill 93 would require all health benefit plans to provide coverage for hearing aids and related services for children with hearing loss. The Senate Health Services Committee voted to advance the bill Wednesday.\nCell Phones in Schools – House Bill 208 calls on school districts to establish a policy for limiting the use of cell phones during the school day with some exceptions for emergencies and instructional purposes. The bill also calls for statewide regulations that would block access to social media sites on school computers. The House Primary and Secondary Education Committee gave the bill a green light Wednesday.\nFinancial Literacy – House Bill 342 would require high school students to earn one credit in a financial literacy course before graduation. The bill received a nod from the House Primary and Secondary Education Committee on Wednesday.\nSchool Bus Cameras – Senate Bill 38 would allow school districts to install camera systems on school buses to help combat stop arm violations. A portion of the fines from violations would be transferred to school districts to help cover the cost of the cameras. The Senate Transportation Committee advanced the legislation Wednesday.\nSquatting – House Bill 10 seeks to crack down on squatting, providing a more concrete procedure for property owners and law enforcement to quickly remove unauthorized occupants from private property. It would also spell out criminal penalties for squatters who damage property. The House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of the bill Wednesday.\nCoercive Control – House Bill 96 would expand domestic abuse laws to include coercive control and allow victims to seek emergency protective orders based on patterns of coercive behaviors. The measure won support from the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\nInterfering with a Legislative Proceeding – House Bill 399 would create criminal penalties, ranging from a class B misdemeanor to the class D felony, for interfering with a legislative proceeding if the intent is to prevent the general assembly from conducting business. The House Judiciary Committee passed the bill Wednesday.\nStreet Racing – House Bill 465 aims to curb illegal street racing with tougher penalties for offenders. Violations would result in a $1,000 fine for the first offense and a $2,000 fine for subsequent offenses. Violators could also have their car seized, and for a second offense, spend up to 30 days in jail. The House Judiciary Committee advanced the bill Wednesday.\nKindergarten Readiness – House Bill 240 would require schools to administer a reading assessment to kindergarten students within the final 14 days of the academic year. Students who fail to meet grade-level benchmarks and standards would likely need to repeat kindergarten under the proposal. The legislation won support on the House floor Wednesday.\nRepeat DUIs – Under House Bill 220, offenders would face a class D felony charge if caught driving under the influence for a third time. The bill would also create escalating fines for repeat offenses. The House advanced the bill Wednesday.\nFamily Preservation – House Bill 291 seeks to reduce the impact of incarceration on families. When a nonviolent offender serves as a caregiver of a dependent child, the bill would call on judges to consider that role before imposing a sentence for a felony. The House voted in support of the legislation Wednesday.\nSuper Speeders – Senate Bill 57 would levy a new $200 fee against \"super speeders,\" a proposed term for those convicted of driving more than 25 miles per hour over the speed limit on a state highway. Revenue from the legislation would help fund Kentucky's emergency trauma network. The Senate advanced the measure Wednesday.\nYouth Nicotine Use – Senate Bill 100 seeks to curb underage nicotine use by licensing nicotine retailers and providing more oversight of nicotine sales. Retailers operating without a license could face a misdemeanor charge, and possibly a felony for a third offense. The Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\nAntisemitism on Campus – Senate Joint Resolution 55 would direct Kentucky colleges and universities to adopt policies for combating antisemitism. It also calls on campuses to disband and report any student organizations that have provided resources to terrorist organizations. The resolution received support from the Senate on Wednesday.\nDisabilities and Parental Rights – Senate Bill 26 would clarify that disability alone cannot be used as a basis for terminating adoption petitions, terminating parental rights, or determining placement of children. The House Families and Children Committee passed the bill Thursday.\nPersonal Image Rights – Senate Bill 7 would create legal protections to ensure that an image of a person's unclothed body cannot be used for commercial purposes without explicit consent. The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced the legislation Thursday.\nGift Card Scams – Under Senate Bill 130, individuals who tamper with gift cards with the intention to steal funds could face a class D felony charge. The bill received a nod from the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.\nCounseling Services – Under House Bill 495, mental health services that seek to ease distress related to sex or sexual attraction would be considered protected counseling services. The bill would prevent state agencies and licensing authorities from taking adverse actions against mental health professionals or ordained ministers who provide those services. Supporters argue that the bill is needed to prevent discrimination, but critics say it opens the door to conversion therapy. The House State Government Committee passed the measure Thursday.\nChronic Wasting Disease – House Bill 700 would forbid the exportation of wild deer and elk from a chronic wasting disease surveillance zone. Supporters say the goal is to prevent spread of the fatal prion disease and protect Kentucky's deer and elk population. The House Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Committee voted in support of the bill Thursday.\nMake America Healthy Again – Senate Concurrent Resolution 61 would establish the Make America Healthy Again Kentucky Task Force and charge the group with exploring ways to integrate the principles for the MAHA movement to improve health outcomes in Kentucky. The Senate Families and Children Committee passed the resolution on Tuesday, and the Senate advanced the measure off the floor Thursday.\nReporting Child Abuse – Under Senate Bill 120, school coaches would receive training on the duties and procedures for reporting child abuse. The legislation would also add language to sports participation forms telling parents and students about the right to report abuse and how to make a report. The Senate passed the bill Thursday.\nArtificial Intelligence – Senate Bill 4 would boost oversight and create guidelines for using artificial intelligence in state government and elections. The Senate Committee on State and Local Government gave the bill a nod on Wednesday, and the legislation cleared the Senate on Friday.\nLawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday.\nKentuckians can track the action this year through Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Education Committee unanimously approved legislation Thursday that would update Kentucky's name, image and likeness law in response to issues that have cropped up since it was first adopted for college athletes.\nName, image, likeness laws – known as NIL – allow student-athletes to generate personal income from their image and celebrity.\nSenate Bill 3, sponsored by Senate Majority Floor Leader Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, seeks to tackle new issues that have emerged in the \"constantly evolving\" NIL landscape. Wise said the legislation would allow Kentucky to remain prepared and competitive in the new era of college sports.\n\"It's a time for us to act, and it's a time for us to update to make sure that the Commonwealth of Kentucky and our universities are not left behind when it comes to college athletics,\" he said.\nSB 3 would align Kentucky's law with national standards, allowing state universities to participate in the emerging revenue sharing model. It would also establish legal protections by providing clear guidelines that ensure fair compensation and protect the student-athletes and the institutions.\nThe bill also includes an emergency provision, meaning it could take effect as soon as the bill becomes law. The urgency will ensure Kentucky's institutions remain competitive as the national landscapes shift, Wise said.\nThe recent House v. NCAA lawsuit has introduced potential changes that could reshape student-athlete compensation, and a proposed $2.5 billion federal settlement is expected to be finalized by April 7. This might allow universities to directly compensate student-athletes, something not previously included in Kentucky's framework, Wise said.\nMitch Barnhart, athletics director at the University of Kentucky, testified that times have changed regarding NIL, and institutions are facing \"choppy waters\" now. He said there are 50 different states that are doing 50 different things, and continuity in laws or rules is important.\nBarnhart was joined by Josh Heird, director of athletics at the University of Louisville, in Thursday's testimony.\n\"A lot of times we compete,\" Barnhart said of Heird. \"But on this, we're on the same team. We both need help as we continue to adjust to the landscape that's in front of us, and the 2022 bill was amazing. It was really, really helpful at a time we desperately needed it.\"\nHeird said he appreciates the proactive approach of the legislators. He offered some details about the settlement.\n\"If approved, the House settlement will assist in creating a framework that provides additional benefits to student-athletes, but also creates guardrails that are much needed in this current environment. The anticipated date for a decision on the House settlement is the first few weeks of April,\" he said.\nHeird said SB 3 would update current state laws so UofL, UK and other schools can implement the presumed changes that will take place if the House settlement is approved.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said it's clear in his mind that Congress and the NCAA are weak about addressing NIL issues. He also talked about how extremely competitive Kentuckians are sports-wise.\n\"I think it's great that come March, we're going to have both the UK and UofL back in the NCAA tournament, both in the men's and women's tournaments, and that's wonderful for our state,\" he said.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, said he thinks NIL has \"absolutely destroyed\" college sports, but he can't let Kentucky get behind other states regarding NIL.\n\"You can't focus on the game because all they talk about is that the best player is about to leave to go to another school. I have lost interest in college sport because of it. And it's difficult for me to vote yes for this, and I regret the vote that I made, but in saying that, I also know Kentucky has to compete,\" he said.\nSen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, said he shares Carroll's sentiments.\n\"I wish we could go back, back in the days where the athletes played for the name on the front of the uniform rather than the back. I know we have to do this. I offer my yea vote begrudgingly,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Chronic wasting disease – or zombie deer disease – poses a threat to Kentucky's deer and elk population and industry, experts say. Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, wants to prevent that from happening.\nBray is the primary sponsor of House Bill 700, which he presented to the House Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Committee on Thursday alongside Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commissioner Rich Storm.\nThe legislation would place restrictions on the movement of cervids (deer and elk) in chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance zones.\nStorm said chronic wasting disease is a 100% incurable and fatal prion disease. The only way to test an animal for the disease is by testing a lymph node from the base of the deer's skull. Bray said the disease cannot be transmitted to humans, but other prion diseases, like mad cow disease, are transmissible to humans.\nKentucky has had two isolated cases of chronic wasting disease, Bray said, but other states haven't been so lucky. In states where the disease has spread, hunting tourism has declined.\n\"My greatest fear – as I sit here today – if we do nothing, and CWD spreads across this state, once it hits interior Kentucky, we will forever wish we had done something today,\" Bray said.\nStorm said Kentucky has a conservation and fiduciary responsibility to preserve Kentucky's cervid population and $2 billion hunting industry. Kentucky also has a thriving deer farming industry.\nUnder HB 700, it would be unlawful to export any wild cervid outside a CWD surveillance zone. Those zones are defined as a 30-mile radius from a positive CWD detection, according to the legislation.\nFor captive cervids, the bill would make it unlawful to export a captive cervid outside a 10-mile radius from a CWD positive captive cervid facility. Cervid facilities who install double fencing could be exempt from some of the regulations in HB 700, Bray said.\nThe bill would allow a CWD surveillance zone designation to expire five years after the zone's last positive CWD case.\nStorm said the legislation would still allow the export of certain cervid products.\n\"They will be able to continue to sell (boneless) meat, the byproducts, the antlers,\" he said.\nSeveral representatives of Kentucky's deer farming industry testified they're already taking precautionary measures when it comes to CWD.\nHenry Woodard, who serves on the Kentucky Alternative Livestock Association board, said deer farming is already heavily regulated by Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Agriculture and the USDA.\n\"We take CWD very seriously,\" he said. \"… We have a CWD response plan already in the state, and it is a response plan by our Department of Ag that we fall under. We test every mortality in our herds for CWD, regardless of proximity to a CWD positive case.\"\nWoodward said HB 700 could shut down many of Kentucky's deer farms.\nSeveral lawmakers had questions about CWD, including how to test for it.\nRep. William Lawrence, R-Maysville, asked about the future of a live test for CWD where farmers and Fish and Wildlife would be able to test a live cervid.\nStorm said he's \"very confident\" there will be a live test in the years to come, but right now there isn't one that's approved.\n\"When the day comes that there's a live test, we can absolutely come back in and change all of this, because it won't be as necessary,\" Bray said.\nLawrence said he understands the urgency behind HB 700, but he worries how the bill may hurt deer farmers.\n\"If I was told I couldn't (operate) for the next five years, it could crush my business,\" Lawrence said, adding he hopes the legislature could communicate the sense of urgency for a live test on a federal level.\nThe House Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Committee approved HB 700 by a 13-1 vote with three pass votes.\nIn explaining his \"yes\" vote, Rep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington, said he's looking forward to using the \"robust\" legislative process to make sure HB 700 is as \"perfect a bill as is possible.\"\nBray said he and Storm have been working with all stakeholders, including the farmers, on the bill and are hoping to find a solution everyone can be content with.\n\"I love deer. I love deer hunting,\" Bray said. \"I would never want to do anything to hurt anybody's business, but there's far too much to lose if we sit here and do nothing.\"\nHB 700 now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky Senate adopted a bill Wednesday that supporters say will strengthen religious liberty in the commonwealth even as some raise concerns about discrimination.\nSenate Bill 60, sponsored by Sen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, advanced off the Senate floor with a 29-7 vote and now heads to the House.\nThe legislation seeks to reenforce religious liberty protections in Kentucky. Specifically, it would waive sovereign and governmental immunity, clearing the way for individuals to sue if the government substantially burdens their religious freedom.\nRawlings said SB 60 would enable religious claimants to get full relief when the government violates their religious liberty, and it would clarify that individuals can invoke the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in judicial or administrative proceedings.\n\"It ensures that Kentuckians who face a substantial burden on their religious exercise have a fair opportunity to seek justice, including the ability to recover attorney's fees, just as we allow in civil rights cases,\" he said.\nSen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, spoke in favor of the measure on the Senate floor, arguing that it ensures freedom and would help prevent the government from bullying Kentuckians out of their religious rights.\n\"Our Founding Fathers gave us the constitution not to shield the government from the people, but to protect we the people from an overreaching government,\" he said. \"Today, that overreach too often comes in the form of costly legal battles where the government with its unlimited resources can financially cripple a citizen simply for standing by their faith.\"\nHowever, critics of the bill cited fears over the impact of SB 60 on anti-discrimination efforts.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, said the legislation could make it difficult for the government to enforce state and local laws that protect people from harm and discrimination, and that lawmakers should make sure everyone receives fairness and justice.\n\"There's a balance that must be struck between protecting religious freedom and ensuring that marginalized communities are not further harmed,\" Herron said. \"No one has the right to harm others, even if those actions are motived by religious beliefs.\"\nRawlings said current state RFRA law already played a crucial role in protecting rights. It was used to reopen churches during COVID-19 and defend the rights of an incarcerated Muslim woman to wear a headscarf in front of male guards, he said.\n\"What Senate Bill 60 does is ensure that when the government oversteps, citizens have the ability to recover legal costs when defending their rights, just as they would in other civil rights cases,\" he said.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said federal laws prevent discrimination based on race, sex and religion, but do not apply to sexual orientation. He noted that advocates have sought for years to pass a fairness law in Kentucky, which would include sexual orientation among civil rights laws.\nThomas said if a police officer or a government official tried to enforce a fairness ordinance, the person could be personally liable and lose their home, car and bank assets.\n\"It's designed to wipe out all fairness ordinances and expose members of the LGBTQ community again to second class citizenship. Now this is the second time we've done this in this session,\" he said.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, voted for the bill, however, saying it offers clarification of definitions, gives citizens appropriate relief and is a safeguard against those who might violate religious liberties of Kentuckians.\n\"I gladly vote yes,\" Mills said.\nFRANKFORT —The Kentucky House of Representatives approved a bill Wednesday that would allow local water districts to remove fluoride from the water supply.\nSponsored by Rep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, House Bill 16 does not ban fluoride, but makes it optional.\n\"House Bill 16 removes the unfunded state mandate on water producers that requires fluoride to be added to water after the water is treated and cleaned for consumption,\" Hart said.\nRep. William Lawrence, R-Maysville, is a co-sponsor of the legislation. He has experience working in a wastewater and water treatment facility and spoke on his personal experience with the chemical on the House floor.\n\"Fluoride in water is an unfunded state mandate and forced medication,\" he said. \"... I'm telling you from a personal stance, it's dangerous stuff. I don't allow my children to drink tap water. Their teeth are fine.\"\nLawrence said despite Kentucky mandating water fluoridation, Kentucky is still 48th in the nation when it comes to dental health.\n\"It's not working. We need to do something else,\" he said.\nSeveral other lawmakers, however, said they believe fluoride is beneficial to oral health.\nRep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington, said he would be thinking about children who cannot care for their own teeth when voting \"no\" on HB 16. His mother-in-law, who is a physician, told him children can struggle with sleep apnea, chronic jaw pain and diabetes later in life due to poor dental health.\n\"I very much see the need for local control and decisions like these to be made locally,\" Moore said. \"At the same time, I know that we have an obligation to be looking out for the people who sent us here, especially our children.\"\nRep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, said she also foresees Kentuckians, especially children, may have more costly dental health issues if fluoride is removed from the water.\n\"We were all elected by our constituents to be watchdogs of our taxpayers' money, and $1.9 million, which is a low estimate of what this bill could cost Medicaid and our tax payers, is a lot of money,\" she said.\nMarzian filed a floor amendment to require local water districts to reimburse the Department for Medicaid Services for utilization costs of Medicaid-covered dental services. The amendment was not adopted.\nRep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, joined Moore and Marzian in speaking against allowing fluoride to be optional. She said adding small amounts of fluoride to drinking water for the last 75 years has \"dramatically improved dental health.\"\nShe also said those who do not want to use or consume fluoride, do not have to.\n\"Thanks to science, individuals can utilize a reverse osmosis filter or a distillation filter,\" Camuel said. \"Those filters remove up to 92% of fluoride from tap water.\"\nAnother co-sponsor of HB 16, Rep. Ryan Dotson, R-Winchester, said he is also concerned about fluoride's impact on health, but he agrees with Lawrence. He said he's read research that shows fluoride is a neurotoxin that can reduce IQ, weaken bones and cause thyroid issues, among other health problems.\nDotson also said fluoride can cost local governments up to $600,000 a year, and most of the fluoridated water ends up going down the drain.\n\"We are mass medicating without informed consent or a right to refuse…. It's wasteful, with little to no efficacy at all,\" Dotson said.\nThe House approved HB 16 by a 68-29 vote. The legislation now heads to the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Health Services Committee unanimously advanced a bill Wednesday that would make buying hearing aids for children more affordable through insurance plans in Kentucky.\nSponsored by Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, the bill would require all health benefit plans to provide coverage for hearing aids and related services for children with documented hearing loss. It also calls for state regulations that establish a minimum coverage amount of $2,500 per hearing aid.\nOne supporter, Jennifer Hughes, testified that her son was born with hearing loss, and the family faced challenges with inadequate insurance coverage for his hearing aids.\nHughes said her son received his first pair of hearing aids when he was two months old, and there was an immediate difference. When he turned three years old, his audiologist recommended upgrading to a pair that cost $5,000.\n\"Long story short, we paid the full $5,000 for the hearing aids,\" Hughes said. \"Only $2,000 of that went towards our deductible and out-of-pocket. And then the insurance didn't pay anything.\"\nPediatric audiologist Shelley Moats also testified that prior legislation needs to be updated to meet today's situations. She said a law passed in 2002 required insurance plans to cover the devices for children, but it has not kept pace with the changes in the health care environment, specifically when it comes to high-deductible insurance plans.\n\"Most parents end up being completely out-of-pocket on the purchase of hearing aids for their child,\" she said, adding that of the roughly 58,000 babies born in Kentucky in 2023, about 175 had permanent hearing loss.\nSen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville, asked if the price for hearing aids is associated with the size and development of children.\nMoats said children are typically fit with hearing aids that go behind the ear and have a life expectancy of about five years as children sweat and get dirty. That creates a replacement cost over time, she said.\nBerg said the original version of the bill included coverage requirements for adults as well, but she removed those provisions in the current version. She also expressed concern about a lack of pediatric audiologists in Kentucky networks.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, asked about a fiscal note, and Berg said it was for the original bill.\n\"We have requested a second fiscal note. We've not gotten that back, but the assumption is it's going to be less than the current because we excluded adults, and the original fiscal bill included those people,\" she said.\nMills asked about breakage, loss and maintenance of hearing aids.\nMoats said manufacturers understand that hearing aids for children are at risk of loss or breakage, and the cost includes unlimited repair and a one-time replacement for loss or damage during the warranty period.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Criminal penalties for unlawful street racing in Kentucky would increase under a new House bill.\nThe House Judiciary Committee approved House Bill 465 on Wednesday. Rep. Beverly Chester-Burton, D-Shively, and House Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, are the primary sponsors of the legislation.\nChester-Burton, who represents part of Jefferson County, said the bill was modeled after Louisville Metro Council's efforts to curb street racing.\n\"House Bill 465 is presented today as an effort to address the issue of street racing where it's been significantly affecting my area in Jefferson County,\" she said. \"However, I have had other members throughout the community who have contacted me about street racing.\"\nThe current penalty for street racing in Kentucky is a $200 fine. Under HB 465, the fine would increase to $1,000 on the first offense, and violators could face a $2,000 fine on the second or subsequent offense, Chester-Burton said.\nViolators could have the vehicle used in the act impounded on a first offense as well. For a second or subsequent offense, violators could spend up to 30 days in jail and have the vehicle seized for crushing or auction. The revenue would go to the Crime Victims Compensation Board, she added.\nNemes said the penalty increase is needed to hopefully deter street racing across the commonwealth.\n\"These are people who are deliberately putting citizens' lives in danger,\" Nemes said. \"They know they're doing it, so the first time we're only going to fine them $1,000. I think it should be much higher than that, but that's what we've put as the first offense.\"\nNemes said street racing is getting \"out of control\" in Jefferson County.\nMetro Councilwoman Donna Purvis testified in support of HB 465. She said illegal street racing often involves violence.\n\"I am sure this is not just a Louisville problem, and for that reason, a message should be sent to the entire state there will be serious consequences for the endangerment of other's lives,\" Purvis said.\nRecreational, permitted street racing is a new activity in the commonwealth. Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, asked Chester-Burton and Nemes if HB 465 could inadvertently ban the activity.\n\"I'm supportive of the bill, but I want to make sure we don't inadvertently prevent the tourism aspect that's going on in southeast Kentucky where we're doing permitted road racing there,\" Blanton said.\nCommittee chair Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, said there is a provision in HB 465 that keeps the recreational road racing exempt. Nemes confirmed the legislation only impacts illegal activities.\nThe House Judiciary Committee approved HB 465 by a 15-0 vote with one member passing.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, decided to vote pass due to constitutionality concerns over the seizure provision in the bill.\n\"I do have constitutional concerns, and I would like to research this further,\" he said, citing a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.\nIn voting \"yes,\" Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, thanked Chester-Burton and Nemes for bringing HB 465.\n\"It is so important,\" she said. \"It's heartbreaking to see what happens — the devastation and the deaths of people — it's going to be all over the state before we know it.\"\nHB 465 will now go before the full House for its consideration\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky has a housing shortage. House Bill 160 could help, according to supporters.\nSponsored by Rep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, HB 160 would ensure qualified manufactured homes that meet strict standards for size, age and permanent foundation are treated the same as site-built homes in single family residential zones.\nThe bill is the result of the work done by the Kentucky Housing Task Force in which Witten served as a co-chair. The goal of last year's task force was to study and review the current and future policy needs of the state to address access and availability of housing to the citizens of the commonwealth.\nWitten said the task force determined the state needs around 200,000 housing units.\n\"These gaps hit all 120 counties. They affect urban, rural and suburban communities, and the shortages are across all price points,\" Witten said. \"It was clear from the testimony that the demand for housing has far outpaced the production of new supply in Kentucky.\"\nManufactured homes could be one of the housing gap solutions, Witten added.\nWitten said local governments would still retain control over cosmetic standards, square footage requirements, setbacks and lot orientation under HB 160. Additionally, the bill would not allow mobile homes, trailers or traditional manufactured homes where they're currently prohibited.\n\"It does not impact HOA rules, deed or developer restrictions, or historical preservation areas,\" Witten added.\nTo address concerns some stakeholders have with the bill, Witten said she worked with Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, on a floor amendment that further clarifies local government authority.\nFlannery said the amendment confirms local governments can protect property values, restores the right to regulate square footage, adds language to regulate setbacks and lot orientation and addresses some concerns about certain shapes and sizes.\nAdditionally, the floor amendment changes the dates of qualified manufactured homes to a rolling five-year period and addresses foundation requirement concerns, Flannery said.\n\"This amendment is the product of good faith negotiations between local government organizations like the (Kentucky Association of Counties) and the (Kentucky League of Cities), and attempts to incorporate some of their suggestions and alleviate some of the concerns and heartburn that they had about this bill as it passed committee,\" Flannery said.\nThe amendment was adopted, and the Kentucky House of Representatives passed HB 160 by a 90-5 vote.\n\"If we truly want to prioritize home ownership for working class Kentuckians, while at the same time addressing our housing shortage, ensuring that qualified manufactured homes are treated equally to cycled homes is an important step,\" Witten said.\nIn explaining her \"yes\" vote, Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, thanked Witten for her work on the bill and the Kentucky Housing Task Force.\nHB 160 now heads to the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Families and Children Committee adopted a resolution Tuesday to explore strategies for better using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment and Training program in Kentucky.\nSenate Resolution 18 calls for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services to compile a report detailing findings, strategies and recommendations for expanding SNAP E&T utilization and submit a report to the general assembly by Dec. 1.\nSponsored by Senate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald A. Neal, D-Louisville, the resolution was adopted with an 8-0 vote. One legislator cast a pass vote.\n\"SNAP E&T is a powerful tool for Kentucky and businesses alike. It helps individuals receiving SNAP benefits to gain valuable job training education and workforce development opportunities while strengthening our state's labor market by fully leveraging federal funding,\" Neal testified. \"We can expand access to training and employment services at no additional cost to the commonwealth.\"\nNeal said Kentucky and other states face workforce participation challenges – mainly in rural and underserved areas. The program provides critical services such as job search assistance, vocational training and support for employment barriers such as transportation and child care.\n\"By expanding our engagement with this program, we can help more individuals transition from public assistance into stable, higher paying jobs and reducing poverty rates and foster economic growth,\" he said.\nJessica Klein, of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, testified that all states are required to operate a SNAP E&T program, and it's up to the states to determine how they will operate.\n\"Kentucky's program helps provide supports to SNAP participants between 16 and 59, and that's a group we call work registrants in the SNAP program,\" she said.\nThe voluntary program is operated by five key partners across Kentucky, and with additional engagement and the possibility of adding more partners, the program could expand, Klein said.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, suggested Amazon as a potential partner, noting that the corporation just celebrated a workforce program graduation.\n\"So maybe that is an organization and entity that you all can talk to and partner with to figure out how we do make this work here in Kentucky,\" she said.\nSen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, asked if the workforce opportunities in the program are taking away dollars from other existing programs.\nCHFS Secretary Eric Friedlander said there are several different elements of the SNAP program, and one doesn't take away from the other. He said it's a supportive piece.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, said the state needs workforce training, but said he's concerned the legislature might have to authorize spending.\n\"I'm concerned slightly about the wording here where it says 'implement strategies to maximize utilization' because I think the administration has used those types of terms on drawdown of Medicaid dollars that have expanded Medicaid,\" he said.\nSen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, asked if there should be a fiscal note with the resolution, and Committee Chair Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, said the matter at hand is a simple resolution.\nMeredith cast a pass vote.\nWhen Herron cast her vote, she recognized the other legislators' concerns about possible funding.\n\"I want my colleagues to just know, I know there has been a little concern about what potential costs, if anything, but just remember whatever the cost is, it's for workforce. So, if we're putting anything in, the goal is that these individuals would have employment, higher education so that they then would not be utilizing the SNAP benefits program,\" she said.\nThe resolution now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill seeking to curb issues in the planning and zoning process at the local level advanced from the House Local Government Committee on Tuesday.\nRep. John Hodgson, R-Fisherville, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 18. He told the committee the bill would require local elected officials to have a say on new developments in single-family zoned areas instead of leaving the decision solely up to unelected planning and zoning boards.\nHodgson said multi-family dwellings and other developments are causing infrastructure issues, such as unsafe traffic congestion, in certain communities across Kentucky.\n\"Some suburban areas are seeing attempts to insert high-density apartments and development into these single-family areas, straining the infrastructure to the breaking point and fundamentally changing the quiet character of the existing neighborhoods forever,\" he said.\nUnder HB 18, any density development project proposed in a traditional single-family home zone would be treated as if it were an amendment to the zoning map and would be required to be approved by the local fiscal court or legislative body.\nAdditionally, the legislation would create some development incentives for infill development in urban areas, Hodgson said. Another provision also provides a two-year extension on a moratorium on zoning district classification changes.\nRep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, said she is concerned certain provisions of HB 18, like the moratorium extension, may make the housing crisis in Kentucky worse.\n\"I think density is the key, and this concerns me that we are restricting local communities … This seems to go against a whole other effort that we're up against in this state. Is there something else that I'm missing?\" Stalker said.\nHodgson said he agrees there are areas that need density, but making sure the infrastructure to support it is crucial. There are highways in the state where emergency vehicles cannot safely pass through due to high traffic caused by high-density development, he said.\n\"(House Bill 18) doesn't stop you from doing density development. You just have to have weigh-in and a vote by the elected officials,\" Hodgson added.\nLiam Gallagher, legislative director for Americans for Prosperity Kentucky, testified against the legislation to the committee. He spoke against a provision of the bill that would limit new leases of certain properties in single-family home zones and said the measure would hurt housing development and limit property rights.\nRep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, also said he has concerns about HB 18, but he agrees there are planning and zoning issues that need to be addressed.\n\"I am concerned from a development standpoint and want to make sure that there are incentives to provide housing and so forth,\" Fleming said, adding he appreciates the effort but needs to clarify some things before moving forward.\nFleming recorded a \"pass\" vote on the bill.\nEchoing Hodgson's earlier comments, Rep. Jared Bauman, R-Louisville, said there are three major developments planned for a road in his district that cannot support the traffic.\n\"I'm thinking that my constituents support this very much because you are going to strengthen their position to push back against these developments that end with three-story apartments overlooking homes that have been in that neighborhood for 60 to 80 years,\" Bauman said, encouraging the committee to vote \"yes\" on HB 18.\nThe House Local Government Committee voted 14 to 4 with two pass votes to send HB 18 to the House floor.\nFRANKFORT — A bill currently on the move in the Kentucky House of Representatives seeks to reduce incarceration rates and keep families together.\nRep. Nick Wilson, R-Williamsburg, and other stakeholders testified on House Bill 291 before the House Families and Children Committee on Thursday. Wilson is the primary sponsor of the legislation and the committee's vice-chair.\nHB 291, also known as the Family Preservation and Accountability Act, would ask judges to consider a defendant's status as a caretaker of a dependent child before imposing a sentence for a felony offense.\n\"The Family Preservation and Accountability Act addresses challenges by expanding sentencing alternatives for primary caregivers convicted of nonviolent offenses,\" Wilson said.\nThe legislation would not apply to defendants convicted of a violent offense or defendants who used or attempted to use physical force while committing the crime. If the victim is a child or statute prohibits alternative sentencing, HB 291 would also not apply.\n\"The intent of the bill is to prioritize family unity, reduce harm from the separation of parents and children, and offer a rehabilitative approach that preserves that parent-child relationship while safeguarding child safety, safety of the community, while taking all of those things into consideration,\" Wilson said.\nWilson said the bill would allow defendants at the time of conviction to file a motion asking the judge to consider their status as a primary caregiver. The judge would then determine whether the defendant is a primary caregiver. If true, then the judge can use that information during sentencing.\nThe bill would allow the court to require a defendant participate in a substance use disorder treatment program, parenting classes, anger management, job training, literacy classes and more in addition to the imposed sentence, Wilson said.\nSarah Durand, vice president of government affairs for Kentucky Free, testified alongside Wilson. She said HB 291 would save the state $74 million in direct incarceration costs.\n\"That is just savings of housing incarcerating primary caregivers,\" Durand said. \"However, national research indicates that for every dollar spent on incarceration, society loses an additional $10 in indirect costs. As we looked at this and looked at those indirect costs, this bill has the ability to add $740 million annually to the state's economy.\"\nCortney Downs with Kentucky Youth Advocates said parental incarceration is an adverse childhood experience, which is a traumatic event occurring in childhood that is often associated with negative long-term outcomes.\nNearly 102,000 children in Kentucky will experience parental incarceration, she added.\n\"The persistently high rates of kids who are affected by parental incarcerations creates an urgency for us to minimize the impact,\" Downs said, adding HB 291 will help children.\nKenton County Circuit Court Judge Patricia Summe said there are \"a lot of good things\" about HB 291, but she has concerns about some of the language in the bill and how a ruling may impact a family court case.\n\"Our biggest concern is about the overlap and the crossing of making decisions about whether or not somebody is a caregiver, not a parent, but a caregiver, and how much that involves.\"\nWilson said the judges have a valid point about not wanting to \"step on family court's toes.\"\n\"We added a section that the determination that's being made under this bill is not admissible as evidence in family court,\" he said, adding he's willing to continue working on the legislation's language.\nRep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, said she supports the legislation, but would support more changes.\n\"I'm in support of this. I just want to find a way that really helps streamline the information that the judges need to make these determinations,\" Moser said.\nThe House Families and Children Committee unanimously approved HB 291. It will now go before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Education Committee on Thursday unanimously advanced Senate Bill 19, which would require public schools to establish procedures for moments of silence and reflection in the classroom.\nThe bill's sponsor, Sen. Rick Girdler, R-Somerset, testified that the measure would allow students to have a moment of silence at the start of the school day without any religious connotations.\nTestifying with Girdler was Rabbi Shlomo Litvin, who is involved with several Jewish organizations and is director of Central Kentucky's branch of Chabad-Lubavitch.\nLitvin said he strongly endorses SB 19 because a moment of silence has long been recognized as a valued practice in schools to offer students an opportunity for reflection, mindfulness and focus. He said under the measure, teachers wouldn't be allowed to tell the students how to use the time.\n\"It fosters an important sense of self-worth among students and strengthens their respect for one another. As we explore meaningful ways to uplift and support our students, a brief 60-120 seconds of silence, of silent reflection, is a simple yet powerful tool that can make a real difference,\" he said.\nResearch consistently demonstrates that such moments enhance cognitive abilities, concentration, and emotional well-being, Litvin said. He added that they also contribute to a more respectful and thoughtful school environment.\n\"Importantly, Senate Bill 19 does not infringe on religious freedom. It is crafted by Jewish leaders here in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and has been endorsed by rabbis from across the state as well as religious leaders from a diverse range of faith groups and secular mental health professionals, he said.\nRabbi Ben Freed of Keneseth Israel Congregation of Louisville, said some points of the bill are \"wonderful,\" but cited concerns with changing the law to require moments of silence.\nThe possibility that The Lord's Prayer could be recited before the moments of silence is also a concern, Freed said.\n\"And I feel that mandating it goes, to me, a step too far especially in conjunction with the fact that earlier in this statute, the statute states that it is permissible to have a recitation of the Lord's Prayer… I find that to be somewhat problematic for a Jewish kid who would be in a classroom,\" he said.\nMindy Haas, executive director of The Jewish Federation of the Bluegrass, said the federation agrees with Freed, and there are rabbis in Lexington who do not support the bill.\nSen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, asked the speakers if moments of silence are already being observed in public schools. Girdler and Litvin said they aren't aware of this happening.\nTichenor said the measure would offer children a chance to take a deep breath and have some silence. She also said the United States has a deep history of Christianity, and teaching this as a historical fact can be valuable to students.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said he takes his faith very seriously, and as he reads the bill, there's nothing to prohibit a Jewish, Muslim or Christian student from using the moment of silence to think about religion in the context of which they've been trained.\nThomas said religion can be used in two ways – either as a sword or as a shield.\n\"And when I see statutes where religion is being the sword to promote bigotry or discrimination or hate, then I'm going to oppose. I'm going to oppose those bills, because there's no place in American for a religion to be used in that context,\" he said. \"But where religion is being as a shield, to provide comfort, or consolation or just a moment of peace for a person, then I'm going to allow that, and that's what this bill does.\"\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate.\nFRANKFORT — A bill to expand and improve services for justice-involved, high-acuity youth received unanimous endorsement Wednesday from the Kentucky Senate. The legislation is part of a multi-year effort to reform juvenile justice in the commonwealth.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, testified that the bill he's sponsoring – Senate Bill 111 – stems from a working group dedicated to the complicated issue.\n\"Senate Bill 111 is another product of the DJJ working group established by leadership in both chambers two years ago. The bill is also very much a collaborative effort with the Justice Cabinet, the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the Kentucky Hospital Association,\" he said.\nCarroll said the bill would create a protocol for determining the proper location to provide mental health treatment to youths. It would also establish enhanced rates for inpatient psychiatric hospitals and pediatric teaching hospitals caring for youths.\nIn addition, SB 111 would create a process to remove youths who commit acts of violence or incite violence at a treatment facility, and it would create a process to move youths to a lower level of care if a physician determines that the current level is no longer required.\nThe bill also calls for the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet to construct a specialized mental health facility to provide residential treatment for high-acuity youth in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice.\nThe Cabinet for Health and Family Services would need to contract with a public teaching university to provide clinical services to the facility.\nSB 111 also contains language addressing confidentially of juvenile records and other provisions, Carroll said.\nThe original bill included provisions to construct two female juvenile detention facilities, but that language was removed from the bill through a floor amendment Wednesday.\nCarroll said the facilities are still being planned, but the current legislative session is a non-budget year. He expects the facilities could be broached again during the 2026 legislative session.\nCurrently, females are housed in a single facility, and there are times when it has been at capacity. Counties are often transporting females across the state, he said.\n\"We do plan to move forward with that. But there is, right now, a $90 million price tag on these two facilities, and we will continue to work in that direction,\" he said.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, thanked Carroll and said she wants to help solve juvenile justice related challenges. She expressed concern about a high turnover rate of juvenile justice commissioners and other cases of instability, which can have a negative effect on the youth.\nHerron said she has spent several years working with justice-involved youth who are in the foster care system, and that they respond to their environment.\n\"I think we have a huge responsibility to continue to analyze, review and look at, from the top to bottom, the needs of our kids who are justice-involved. And it's not just the kids who are in facilities, but it's also the kids who are in communities, the kids when they're coming home to re-entry,\" she said.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said she has heard from constituents about juvenile justice issues.\n\"I stand to thank the people who have been working on this bill. This is an issue that I've had constituents come to me about,\" she said. \"This is an issue in our state that is of high significance, and I really want to say that this is something I think we're moving forward with and thank you.\"\nFRANKFORT — A measure to set aside funding for nuclear energy development grants in Kentucky was unanimously given the green light by the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee on Wednesday.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, testified that the bill he's sponsoring – Senate Bill 179 – will bolster the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority (KNEDA). Lawmakers established the group last year to promote the development of nuclear energy and a related ecosystem within Kentucky.\n\"This bill establishes the nuclear energy grant program within KNEDA. As you all will remember, we appropriated $40 million that went to the University of Kentucky to support the nuclear authority and also EPIC (Energy Planning and Inventory Commission). The provision was that those boards would be operated with the interest from the $40 million investment that we made,\" he said.\nThe measure calls for setting aside $10 million of the $40 million for grants, and it sets up a subcommittee of board members to oversee the process for evaluating applications and awarding funds.\nThe maximum grant an entity could receive would be $2 million. But over time, more funding could be earmarked for the effort, Carroll said. He pointed to nuclear development in Tennessee, and said Kentucky can't lag behind other states.\nTennessee has invested about $95 million in such efforts, \"and as a result, Tennessee has taken the lead in this country on the development. The first small scale reactor, SMR (small modular reactors), will be built in Tennessee, and they are getting numerous businesses, development coming in related to nuclear,\" he said.\nSen. Stephen West, R-Paris, thanked Carroll for his work on the initiative.\n\"This is important now. We needed this yesterday. Just look forward to working on this with you in the future,\" he said.\nCarroll said he and West continue to learn more about nuclear energy, and \"these are historical times, and Kentucky has got to step up in this area or we've going to be left behind.\"\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, said he agrees with West that moving forward is necessary.\n\"All of us on this committee are concerned about energy, and we've got to put our head down and get to work and get back to being a leader in energy in the nation,\" he said.\nCommittee Chair Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, encouraged committee members to study energy-related bills that are moving through the committee.\n\"Let's take the time to do the due diligence so they can move through our committee quickly. It is going to be very pivotal for us to take advantage of having a president that has a power policy,\" he said.\nSmith said now is a transitional time for American energy, and the United States needs to be at the forefront of energy and artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\"And we don't want to wind up being energy poor,\" he said. \"We've seen what that does to other nations. That does not need to happen to us, so I do really applaud the effort here.\"\nThe bill now heads to the Senate.\nFRANKFORT — Seven years ago, a gunman killed 17 people at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, including 14-year-old Alyssa Alhadeff.\nAlyssa's mother Lori Alhadeff joined Rep. Kevin Jackson, R-Bowling Green, Rep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, and a group of Kentucky students to testify on House Bill 14 during the House Primary and Secondary Education Committee meeting on Wednesday.\nHB 14, also known as Alyssa's Law, would allow Kentucky public schools to implement a wearable panic alert system for teachers, administrators and other school staff. Jackson and Aull are co-sponsors of the legislation.\n\"The principle of Alyssa's Law is simple: Time equals life. And we need to get our kids and teachers to safety quickly and reduce the response time of first responders,\" Alhadeff said.\nThe bill defines a wearable panic alert system as a silent security system. It is a manually activated device that sends a nonaudible signal to the local 911 call center and emergency responder agencies.\nJackson said HB 14 would make Kentucky schools safer.\n\"Seconds matter in an emergency,\" he said. \"This is not only for an active shooter … I've got four little grandkids. That would be our worst nightmare, but it can be used for medical emergencies, fights, etc.\"\nJackson showed an example of the device to the committee. He said its about the same size as the ID badges teachers already wear every day. After the button is pressed three times, the device vibrates and alerts first responders to the exact location of the emergency.\nAull said HB 14 does not currently fund the purchase of the system, but establishes the framework for funding in the biennial budget next year.\n\"The entire cost on the high end would be $6 million and on the low end, it would be about $2 million,\" Aull added. \"And the draft here is a 50/50 match, so the local school district would have some skin in the game as well as the general assembly.\"\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, who is also a teacher, said Jefferson County Public Schools is already in the process of rolling out a similar device.\n\"I believe that we have a different vendor than the one for the sample device,\" she said. \"If there are any limitations that are brought through this legislation that would keep you from having another vendor, would you be supportive in making sure multiple vendors (can be used)?\"\nJackson and Aull said HB 14 is \"vendor neutral.\"\nInstallation isn't the only cost school districts would have to consider. Aull said there are ongoing maintenance fees of up to $7,000 to $8,000 per campus.\nRep. Felicia Rabourn, R-Turners Station, asked if the proposed grant system in the bill would help with any ongoing costs. Under HB 14, The Center for School Safety would have the ability to establish the Wearable Panic Alert Grant Program.\nAull said the bill is written to incentivize installation.\n\"If the general assembly decides to put more money in the fund, then there will be plenty of opportunity for leftover dollars then to go pay for ongoing maintenance as well,\" Aull said.\nAs for training, Rep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, asked who would be responsible for training teachers and other staff on how to use and maintain the devices and deploy them in the correct situation.\n\"I want to make sure that that's harped on and emphasized in order to make sure that the proper protocol is trained for teachers, staff and so forth,\" Fleming said.\nAull said the bill requires that all building personnel receive training on the protocol and the appropriate use of the system.\n\"That training would be led in conjunction with the school district and the vendor to provide that training on what they have installed in the school system,\" Aull added.\nAlyssa's Law unanimously advanced from the committee and now heads to the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Cigar enthusiasts may soon have more places around the commonwealth to sample and enjoy cigars.\nHouse Bill 211, sponsored by Rep. Chris Lewis, R-Louisville, would create a regulatory framework for cigar bars and prevent local anti-smoking ordinances from prohibiting their operation.\nLewis opened his speech on the House floor on Tuesday by telling the Kentucky House of Representatives what House Bill 211 does not do.\n\"This bill does not fully roll back existing smoke-free laws in any local municipality in the commonwealth,\" he said. \"This is not about smoking cigars in a regular bar, your local bowling alley, a restaurant, or in any other public place that doesn't currently allow smoking if you do not want to be exposed to cigar smoke in a public place where smoke free laws currently exist.\n\"Nothing in this bill changes your ability to maintain that separation.\"\nLewis said HB 211 would create a \"very narrow exemption\" to allow smoking of cigars inside cigar bars.\nHB 211 defines cigar bars as a 21 and older establishment that holds a valid quota retail drink license and generates at least 15% of its annual gross income from the on-site sale of cigars, pipe tobacco, paraphernalia, and accessories.\nLewis said the legislation would give local governments oversight of the businesses.\n\"It also adds another layer of government inspections and accountability to the process,\" Lewis said. \"A local government may enact an ordinance requiring a cigar bar to obtain an annual permit for its inspection for its operation to ensure that the applicant complies with the requirements set forth in this legislation.\"\nHB 211 would also require cigar bars that share a physical wall or common enclosed air space with any other structure to implement smoke mitigation measures. A smoke-free area for delivery drivers or mail carriers would also be required in some circumstances, Lewis said.\nHouse Floor Amendment 2, filed by Lewis, would exempt currently operating cigar bars from being required from having a smoke-free delivery area.\n\"This will prevent those businesses currently in operation from incurring unreasonable expenses to establish such a space as a result of this legislation,\" Lewis said.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, spoke against the amendment.\n\"I don't think it's acceptable to require someone who is doing the course of their job, their delivery job, to be required to inhale secondhand smoke,\" she said.\nDonworth and Rep. George Brown Jr., D-Lexington, said cigar bar regulation should be left up to local governments.\n\"I think this bill overrides local control, so I'm vehemently opposed to this piece of legislation,\" Brown said.\nHB 211 cosponsor Rep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said only six or seven cigar bars would be impacted by House Floor Amendment 2, and those delivery drivers typically enter through a well-ventilated part of the business.\n\"I think it's a very reasonable bill, and it certainly does not change any of the existing restaurant laws or bar laws that are on the books now,\" Gooch said. \"With that, I urge people to vote for this amendment and for the bill.\"\nHouse Floor Amendment 2 was adopted by a voice vote.\nThe House also adopted House Floor Amendment 1 by a voice vote. Rep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, filed the amendment.\n\"This is a simple floor amendment that would allow a local government to opt out of the liquor license requirement,\" Doan said. This floor amendment would be helpful for dry counties, he added.\nHB 211 advanced off the House floor by a 74-19 vote. It now goes before the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A measure to combat youth nicotine use in Kentucky – Senate Bill 100 – advanced unanimously Tuesday during a meeting of the Senate Licensing and Occupations Committee.\nThe legislation seeks to stop the supply of tobacco products to underaged children. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, said most retailers follow the law, but action is needed to address \"bad actors.\"\n\"In my 42 years as a retailer, I firmly believe the only way to control the bad actors in this industry is by licensing all retailers of vape, tobacco and alternative nicotine products. This bill takes a strong step in that direction,\" he said.\nThe legislation would establish the Division of Tobacco, Nicotine and Vapor Products Licensing within the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The division would be managed by a director who will enforce regulations on the sale and distribution of tobacco, nicotine and vapor products, Higdon said.\nAdditionally, administrative regulations would be created to govern the products, and investigators would have the authority to inspect any premises where tobacco, nicotine or vapor products are manufactured, stored or sold. Investigators would also have the power to confiscate contraband, he said.\nThe legislation calls for a $250 license and $50 application fee to be obtained before selling the products in Kentucky. If fines and penalties are not paid, the retailer cannot renew a license.\nRetailers operating without a license would face a Class B misdemeanor for the first offense, a Class A misdemeanor for the second offense, and for third and subsequent offenses, a Class D felony.\nRetailers would have access to an appeals process, and 50% of the collected fines would go to enforcement. The remaining funds would support youth education programs on the dangers of nicotine, vaping and tobacco, Higdon testified.\n\"This bill has teeth. If you sell products without a license, you will face criminal penalties,\" he said.\nGriffin Nemeth, a student at the University of Kentucky, leads the #iCANendthetrend Youth Advisory Board. He thanked Higdon for the legislation and testified during the meeting.\nNemeth said Kentucky is approximately one of 10 states where retailers are not required to have licenses to sell tobacco products, and the legislation includes strong, enforceable penalties.\n\"Nicotine dependence and the accessibility of these products pose a real threat to Kentucky kids – not just to their health, not just to their education, but to their futures as a whole,\" he said.\nDelaney Crump, also with #iCANendthetrend and a student at Boyd County High School, said vaping is an academic distraction and leads to under performance. Many students can't resist the vapes that are sometimes sweet and fruity.\n\"The consequences of inaction are devastating. This isn't just about lung cancer 30 years down the line, it's about kids dropping out of sports because their lungs can't keep up. It's about the anxiety and depression that nicotine fuels,\" she said.\nSen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, said that as a mom of teenagers, she is well aware of the issue of vaping in elementary, middle or high school. She said lawmakers have in recent years discussed the importance of holding people accountable.\nSen. Jason Howell, R-Murray, said prevention programs are paramount. He asked Crump where she thinks her peers obtain the vapes.\nShe said adults sometimes buy them for the students. She also hears students talking about the places where they get them.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said vapes can look like flash drives and they're easy for young people to conceal. She said she's concerned about life-long impacts the products can cause.\n\"The thing that concerns me is the testimony about these companies that intentionally design these to appeal to our young people – to make the candy flavors and the bright colors,\" she said.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said the bill is important for young people's health.\n\"I don't know if people out there understand nicotine is as addictive as opioids are. It is extremely addicting, and I know growing up in Kentucky, that I was able to purchase cigarettes by the time I was 12 years old without any difficulty whatsoever,\" she said.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that would regulate automated license plate reader data and other electronic tracking measures is on the move.\nRep. John Hodgson, R-Fisherville, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 20. The same bill advanced from the House unanimously last year but stalled in the Senate, he told the House Transportation Committee on Tuesday.\nUnder HB 20, any entity maintaining or deploying automated license plate readers would be required to delete the collected data within 60 days, unless it is being used as evidence in an investigation or for toll collection. The bill would also prohibit the sale of the data.\nAdditionally, HB 20 would protect Kentuckians from being required, coerced or compelled to be \"microchipped\" or administered a subcutaneous device.\nThe legislation also seeks to protect Kentuckians from unlawful surveillance via a tracking device on a person or property. There would be exceptions. Law enforcement would not be prevented from lawfully using tracking devices, for example.\n\"Basically, we're trying to avoid the non-consensual tracking of the movements of American citizens,\" Hodgson said.\nDuring discussion, Rep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, asked Hodgson, \"Who will be responsible for making sure that the information is deleted after 60 days?\"\nHodgson said law enforcement entities, who are typically the ones managing automated license plate readers, would be responsible.\n\"We rely on the goodwill of the vendors who have that policy in place now, but this would make it illegal to do that,\" Hodgson added.\nRep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, said he noticed the bill allows victims of violations to take civil action, but he suggested considering adding criminal penalties in the future.\n\"I'm very supportive of the bill. But if there's multiple victims involved or a bad actor, I think maybe also amending the criminal code would be helpful,\" Lehman said.\nRep. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, said she hopes HB 20 paves the way for highway safety camera legislation.\nThe House Transportation Committee unanimously approved HB 20. It now heads to the full House for consideration.\nLawmakers ramp up the pace as dozens of bills sail through committees\nFRANKFORT — The Old State Capitol was full of spirit this week as lawmakers gaveled in to session under the painted gaze of Isaac Shelby and George Washington and advanced a pair of bills that would designate every June as Kentucky History Month.\nHouse Bill 313 and Senate Bill 313 are companion measures that each received a nod Tuesday in the Old Capitol building, which served as the home of the Kentucky General Assembly from 1830 to 1910.\nLawmakers conduct a session day in the Old Capitol every few years in a nod to legislative tradition, and this year's event seems like it happened a century ago given the expansive schedule that unfolded throughout the rest of the week.\nOver a packed four days, bills on smoking, insurance fraud, tax exemptions, and driver safety all received action. Lawmakers discussed the legal theories behind Chevron deference and debated a proposal to display the Ten Commandments on the Capitol grounds.\nDeliberations were especially pointed Thursday when the Senate Judiciary Committee took up Senate Bill 2, which would prohibit public funds from being spent on procedures, treatments and surgeries related to gender transition in Kentucky prisons.\nLawmakers sparred over the nature of the procedures – whether they are elective or constitute necessary medical treatment. Ultimately, the bill cleared the committee with a 6-2 vote and now heads to the full chamber. One member voted \"pass.\"\nLawmakers were more unified when the House Judiciary Committee green-lighted a bill related to wrongful convictions.\nUnder House Bill 206, wrongfully convicted individuals who prove their innocence could petition to receive financial compensation based on the amount of time they spent imprisoned, on parole or under supervision. The bill won committee support with a 19-0 vote on Wednesday.\nLike many weeks in the general assembly, education issues also loomed large on the agenda.\nThe House Primary and Secondary Education Committee advanced a measure Wednesday to strengthen dyslexia interventions in public schools.\nHouse Bill 272 would require local boards of education to develop a policy for identifying and assisting students in kindergarten through third grade who have dyslexia. It also calls on the state Department of Education to collect data and annually review and update its guidance on reading and writing difficulties.\nThe same committee also advanced legislation – House Bill 240 – that would require schools to administer a reading assessment to kindergarten students at the end of the academic year. Students who fail to meet grade-level benchmarks and standards would likely need to repeat kindergarten under the proposal.\nTwo bills related to driving are also picking up momentum.\nSenate Bill 99 would forbid drivers from using a personal communication device while operating a motor vehicle. The bill provides some exceptions for emergency use and for adults who use hands-free options. It cleared the Senate Transportation Committee on Wednesday.\nHouse Bill 15 would reduce the minimum age for getting a learner's permit in Kentucky from 16 to 15 years old. It cleared the House Transportation Committee on Tuesday and passed off the House floor Thursday. The bill now heads to the Senate.\nMore than one third of the 2025 legislative session is now over, and many other bills made progress this week. Here's a look at some of the bills that were on the move:\nEducator Preparation Programs – House Bill 251 would establish the Education Professional Standards Board as the primary oversight authority for teacher education programs at state colleges and universities. The Council on Postsecondary Education currently serves in that role. The House Committee on Postsecondary Education advanced the legislation Tuesday.\nCigar Bars – House Bill 211 would authorize cigar bars that generate at least 15% of their revenue from cigar and pipe products to operate in communities that otherwise prohibit smoking. In addition to the revenue threshold, cigar bars would need to meet a series of other requirements in the bill. HB 211 won support in the House Local Government Committee on Tuesday.\nManufactured Housing – House Bill 160 would prohibit local governments from adopting or enforcing zoning regulations that treat manufactured homes differently from single-family homes. HB 160 cleared the House Committee on Local Government on Tuesday.\nInsurance Fraud – Senate Bill 24 would expand the definition of property and casualty insurance fraud to help crack down on unscrupulous contractors and public adjusters who charge unnecessary or fraudulent fees. The Senate Banking and Insurance Committee passed the bill Tuesday.\nProtective Orders – House Bill 38 would create tougher penalties for people who repeatedly violate protective orders. Offenders could face a class D felony if they violate an order three times within five years and the third violation involves the use or threat of violence. The House Judiciary Committee voted in support of the measure Wednesday.\nHomeowner Tax Exemptions – Senate Bill 67 proposes a constitutional amendment that would exempt homeowners who are 65 and older from paying property taxes that result from higher assessments on their permanent residence. The measure cleared the Senate State and Local Government Committee on Wednesday.\nSexual Extortion – Senate Bill 73 seeks to clamp down on sexual extortion by creating tougher penalties for offenders and more legal remedies for victims. It also requires schools and colleges to educate students and parents about the issue and display resources for reporting. The Senate passed the legislation Wednesday.\nChoking Prevention – If a school acquires an anti-choking device, House Bill 44 would require the school to ensure that cafeteria staff and others are trained on using the device, along with the Heimlich maneuver. The bill would also provide some protection against civil liabilities if the student is injured during the intervention. HB 44 advanced off the House floor on Wednesday.\nChevron Deference – Under Senate Bill 84, courts could no longer defer to a state agency's interpretation when dealing with ambiguity in statutes, administrative regulations or orders, a practice known as Chevron deference. The Senate Judiciary Committee gave the bill a nod on Thursday.\nJuvenile Justice – Senate Bill 111 builds on a multi-year effort to reform Kentucky's juvenile justice system. The bill aims to strengthen the process for assessing youth with severe behavioral challenges and developing an appropriate treatment and placement plan. It also calls for two female-only detention centers and seeks to establish a detention center for high acuity youth. The measure advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\nTen Commandments – House Joint Resolution 15 seeks to return a granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments to the Capitol grounds for permanent display. The House State Government Committee gave the resolution a green light Thursday.\nSexual Assault Response Training – House Bill 219 would require emergency medical providers to receive sexual assault emergency response training. The House Health Services Committee approved the bill Thursday.\nGovernment Services – House Bill 182 would forbid state and local government entities from using the word \"free\" to describe any benefit, product or service financed with public funds. The House State Government Committee passed the legislation Thursday.\nSchool Athletics – Under Senate Bill 120, school coaches would receive training on the duties and procedures for reporting child abuse. The legislation would also add language to sports participation forms telling parents and students about the right to report abuse and how to make a report. The Senate Education Committee passed the bill Thursday.\nWater Regulations – Senate Bill 89 would change how state law defines waterways in Kentucky to align with recent changes on the federal level. Lawmakers have debated the impact of the change on environmental regulations in Kentucky, particularly regarding ephemeral waterways. The measure cleared the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee on Wednesday and won support on the Senate floor Friday.\nFriday marked day 12 of this year's short, 30-day session. Lawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday, Feb. 18, which is the last day to file new bills in the Senate. The next day is the last day to file new bills in the House.\nKentuckians can track the action this year through Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — A measure to improve and expand services for youth with severe behavioral and emotional challenges received approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday as part of a multi-year effort to reform juvenile justice in Kentucky.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, testified that the bill he's sponsoring – Senate Bill 111 – reflects the efforts of a working group dedicated to the issue.\nThe legislation focuses on children who have acute mental illness and receive services from the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services while also being involved with the state Department of Juvenile Justice, he said.\n\"We still have kids in facilities today that are in juvenile detention centers. Although I feel the treatment has gotten better, they're still not where they need to be and where they can receive the best care in the safest environment for their situation,\" Carroll said.\nHe noted that the U.S. Department of Justice has been in Kentucky investigating issues involving juvenile justice detention centers.\nSB 111 seeks to strengthen the process for assessing high acuity youth and develop an appropriate treatment and placement plan. If a youth at a psychiatric or pediatric teaching hospital commits or incites violence, the bill provides a process for them to be removed.\nIt also includes a procedure for high acuity youth to move to a lower continuum of care if the treating physician determines that the current level of care is no longer needed, Carroll said.\n\"Many hospitals are reluctant to take children. Under current statute, as it is interpreted, once they receive these children, they have to keep these children. If they assault staff, they still have to keep the children. Police will not remove them from the facility,\" Carroll said.\nSB 111 also seeks to establish a detention center dedicated to high acuity youth. It would provide the highest level of care and serve children who are currently incarcerated or detained in juvenile detention centers, Carroll said.\nThe bill would also require the Department of Juvenile Justice to operate at least two female-only detention centers and to separate violent and nonviolent youth.\nCarroll said preliminary cost estimates would be $45 million each for the female detention centers and an additional $5 million to complete design work for the high acuity mental health detention center.\nSenate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said he advised Carroll to keep cost estimates in the bill whether or not this legislative session is opened up to budget-related legislation.\n\"…Everybody needs to understand implementation of this bill, which I think everyone knows is probably needed, will come with a price tag. If not this year, it will probably become next year,\" he said.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said new facilities would be expensive, but they are needed.\n\"It's costly. It's going to cost us a lot of money to get this right and to construct and develop facilities that are going to satisfy both our needs and the concerns of the United States Department of Justice,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate.\nFRANKFORT — Rep. Rebecca Raymer, R-Morgantown, hopes two pieces of legislation she's sponsoring would help Kentuckians access better care after a sexual assault.\nThe House Health Services Committee approved House Bill 219 and House Concurrent Resolution 20 on Thursday.\nHB 219 would require emergency medical providers to receive sexual assault emergency response training, and HCR 20 would direct the Legislative Research Commission (LRC) to study access to sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE) in the commonwealth.\nThe training would be conducted by the state's Sexual Assault Response Team Advisory Committee.\nRaymer said she started working on the legislation after learning about gaps in coverage for sexual assault patients in emergency rooms across Kentucky.\n\"While that is a big problem that we need to address, and I think it's a multi-faceted problem, it requires some research and some data for us to know how to correctly address it,\" Raymer said.\nRep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, asked Raymer if she's spoken to any of the SANE nurses about the bill.\nRaymer said she has not reached out to the nurses directly, but the Kentucky Hospital Association and the Kentucky Medical Association did not have an issue with the legislation.\nHB 219 would not mandate a certificate-type program, only training, Raymer added.\n\"This would just allow patients to be referred to the resources that they need in the emergency department, and we would protect the evidence and also ensure the patients aren't being sent away to another facility?\" Committee Chair Rep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, asked.\nRaymer said, \"yes.\"\nUltimately, HB 219 would be \"temporary fix\" for a larger problem, Raymer said. That's where HCR 20 comes in.\n\"What we really want is we want those sexual assault nurse examiners that have that training in these hospitals,\" Raymer said. \"We want them to be there. When our citizens, at possibly one of the most vulnerable times in their life, walk into an ER, they need to have the correct treatment by the correct individual.\"\nThe LRC report under HCR 20 would hopefully give the legislature the information it needs to draft legislation to fix the sexual assault care issues at Kentucky hospitals, Raymer said.\n\"It directs LRC to conduct a study looking at where we have gaps in coverage. Why do we have gaps? Try to find out what hospitals are doing when there isn't a sexual assault nurse examiner on staff,\" Raymer said.\nIf approved, LRC would submit the report by December 2025.\nMoser said the Sexual Assault Advisory Committee has been asking for more SANE nurses for years.\n\"I think this would support that,\" Moser added. \"We will be able to actually see the data, so I think that's really important.\"\nHB 219 and HCR 20 are now before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that seeks to improve safety on roads and highways in Kentucky was given the green light Wednesday during a Senate Transportation Committee meeting with an 8-1-1 vote.\nSen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, is sponsoring Senate Bill 99 with Committee Chair Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon.\n\"It establishes that a person is not allowed to use that personal communication device to write, to send or to read texts while they are operating a motor vehicle,\" Douglas testified.\nDouglas said the bill is needed to prevent catastrophic injuries and deaths, and the measure would improve the safety of pedestrians in cities, those running on the side of the road and those out walking with children on two-lane country roads.\n\"I'm looking to improve the safety of operating motor vehicles in the Commonwealth of Kentucky as well as those who are not distracted. We often forget the other people involved in the accident,\" he said.\nHigdon said the bill includes provisions that truck drivers and bus drivers are already used to.\n\"This is a bill that 120,000 Kentuckians already abide by because it's the exact language that's included in a CDL national law pertaining to truck drivers and bus drivers. They have to stay off the phone, so this has already been applied in Kentucky,\" he said.\nThe measure would still permit adult drivers to access personal communication devices using hands-free options.\nBut the bill would prohibit anyone under the age of 18 from using a personal communication device in any manner while operating a motor vehicle, including hands-free operations, Douglas said.\nVehicle operators would still be allowed to use devices to report illegal activity or summon first responders. The measure would also allow those under the age of 18 to use GPS.\nDouglas testified that school bus drivers with commercial driver's licenses are subject to different state laws, and the bill calls for the state transportation cabinet to update some regulations according to advances in technology.\nViolations of the proposed law would result in a $100 fine. Those under 18 would receive a 90-day license revocation for a violation.\n\"Some may look at this and say that's just entirely too long. Would you say that if it was your mother who was hit by the driver? Would you say that if it was your daughter who was hit by that driver, and you're never going to see them again? I don't think so,\" Douglas said.\nSenate Majority Whip Mike Wilson, R-Bowling Green, voted for the bill, and said its provisions would improve motorcyclists' safety.\nWhen cyclists are hit by another vehicle, the majority of cases are due to distracted driving,\" he said. \"And this is a bill that they have wanted for a long time, so I'm very proud to vote for that.\"\nSen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, also voted for the bill, and said he's seen statistics showing that hands-free usage makes roads safer and that drivers adapt to the changes.\n\"While I was in the trucking industry, we went through the transition from talking on your phone the way we all talk on our phone to the hands-free laws that were passed. I remember the reluctance,\" he said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, also cast a vote for the bill and thanked the bill's sponsors.\n\"I really do believe that this is going to save lives, and I'm very grateful to the sponsors for bringing it forward,\" she said.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Kentuckians wrongfully convicted of a felony may soon have the right to receive restitution\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, presented House Bill 206 to the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. He was joined by several exonerees who shared their experiences and struggles with the committee.\n\"I would like to talk about my support for this bill, how when I was released, housing was difficult,\" said exoneree Paul Hurt. \"I was fortunate enough to have family members still living. A lot of exonerees do not have that luxury of people to help them when they're released. And we're not afforded very much as wrongfully convicted exonerees.\"\nUnder HB 206, Nemes said only Kentuckians who can prove actual innocence would be awarded compensation.\n\"The most important thing to know about this bill is you have to prove actual innocence,\" he said. \"This is not just 'the constable blundered,' or reversal of a conviction or even a pardon. That's not enough. You have to prove that you're actually innocent of the crime for which you were convicted and served time.\"\nIf it becomes law, innocent individuals who file a claim in circuit court within two years of being exonerated would be awarded $65,000 per year of imprisonment. If that person was on death row, they would be awarded $75,000 per year, according to the legislation.\nClaimants would also receive $32,500 for each year they were released on parole, under post-incarceration supervision or wrongfully registered as a sex offender, whichever is greater.\nExonerees may also be eligible to receive other compensation under this bill, such as tuition assistance and attorney's fees.\nWinnie Ye with The Innocence Project said 38 states, Washington D.C. and the federal government have all enacted wrongful conviction compensation laws.\n\"Wrongful convictions are a grave injustice,\" Ye said. \"They're a symptom of our broken criminal legal system. And one way that we can try to address this is by promoting this bill today.\"\nRep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, said he wouldn't call the legal system broken, but he agrees the state should try to do the right thing when a mistake is made, which is why he supports HB 206.\nFlannery said he likes the actual innocence provision of the legislation, but suggested the burden of proof be higher.\n\"Would it perhaps be better to have a higher standard of clear and convincing (evidence), given the gravity of what we're dealing with?\" Flannery asked.\nAccording to Ye, HB 206 follows the same burden of proof standard set by 14 other states. Nemes said he understands the argument Flannery is making and he's open to discussing it further.\nThe House Judiciary Committee unanimously approved HB 206.\nIn explaining her \"yes\" vote, House Minority Whip Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, said she is grateful for the legislation, but wishes it also included a provision that would provide wrongfully convicted Kentuckians a certificate of actual innocence.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, also expressed support for HB 206.\n\"This is a crucial, crucial first step in ensuring accountability as a government,\" Roberts said.\nHB 206 now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A measure to help tackle insurance fraud in Kentucky – Senate Bill 24 – gained unanimous approval Tuesday from legislators on the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee.\nThe legislation would expand the definition of property and casualty insurance fraud to help crack down on nefarious contractors and public adjusters who charge unnecessary or fraudulent fees or who surprise consumers with exorbitant charges, supporters testified.\nSen. Rick Girdler, R-Somerset, is sponsoring the bill. He said it doesn't deal with insurance claims related to bodily injury, only property and casualty insurance. The proposed changes would add more teeth to the law, he said.\n\"You have to prosecute these people,\" Girdler said. \"If you don't prosecute them, we're in trouble.\"\nEric DeCampos of the National Insurance Crime Bureau testified that the bill would provide law enforcement personnel with additional tools to investigate insurance fraud and close loopholes in state laws that are being exploited by fraudsters.\nChris Nolan, testifying on behalf of the Insurance Institute of Kentucky, told committee members that Kentuckians are familiar with storms and catastrophes that have become common. He said the events give unscrupulous people opportunities to commit insurance fraud and prey upon already vulnerable consumers.\n\"As many of you already know, property and casualty insurance fraud is not a victimless crime. It's estimated that the cost to a single family each year is between $400 and $700 in increased premiums due to insurance fraud,\" he said.\nNolan said most contractors and adjustors do a great job in providing services to help people rebuild, but some contractors and public adjusters charge unnecessary, exorbitant, or fraudulent fees to inflate insurance claims.\nSen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, asked those testifying about insurance fraud enforcement.\n\"Is this an issue that commonwealth's attorneys across the commonwealth are not prosecuting insurance fraud,\" he asked. \"Because if that's the case, can you show me a commonwealth's attorney in Kentucky that's not doing their job as it relates to insurance fraud enforcement?\nNolan said an insurance fraud task force meets quarterly, and Department of Insurance investigators update stakeholders regarding the millions of dollars they recover from fraud. Additionally, officials of the DOI have been referring cases to the Kentucky attorney general for prosecution.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, said he can support the bill because it clarifies criminal intent.\n\"I appreciate your willingness to work with this bill to make sure that it's narrowly tailored and actually goes to making sure that someone has criminal intent,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Kentuckians looking for a more convenient way to renew their driver's license may soon have more options under House Bill 161.\nThe House Transportation Committee approved the bill on Tuesday. Primary sponsor, Rep. Kevin Jackson, R-Bowling Green, said the legislation would allow third-party entities to offer driver's license renewal services.\n\"This legislation would leverage a tool already being used in other states to increase the access and availability of driver's license renewal services for Kentuckians,\" Jackson said, reiterating this bill would be for renewals only.\nIn 2022, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation to create 34 regional centers for issuing driver's licenses and renewals, which was a change from the services being offered in all 120 counties. Jackson said this has caused issues for many Kentuckians.\n\"Many folks are forced to drive long distances, wait in long lines, and deal with people they've never met before,\" he said. \"We ask the public to get online to make appointments, but many don't have a computer or Wi-Fi.\"\nToday, roughly 28 states allow third-party entities, like AAA or insurance offices, to offer driver's license renewals, Jackson said.\nUnder HB 161, businesses seeking to offer driver's license renewal services would have to undergo an approval process through the Transportation Cabinet.\n\"Allowing third-party entities to issue driver's license renewals will help streamline the process and make it more accessible for all Kentuckians,\" Jackson said.\nRep. Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, said he noticed the bill mentioned there would be a fee for the service.\n\"Do you have any idea what that range would be?\" Elliott asked. \"Because sometimes fees can get pretty exorbitant, but I think the point that you've made is really good in terms of our inaccessibility to these regional offices, and that does disproportionality affect older folks.\"\nJackson said his research showed renewing at a third-party location would cost an extra $2 to $5 compared to what it would cost at a regional center.\nTwo lawmakers had additional questions about the ability of the third-party entities to do driver's license renewals.\nRep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, asked Jackson if Kentuckians would be able to renew a REAL ID at a third-party site. After May 7, a 2005 federal law will go into effect requiring Americans to have a REAL ID or a passport in order to board a commercial airplane.\nJackson said, yes, the third-party site would be able to do renewals, but would not be able to issue a brand-new REAL ID.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, asked Jackson if the third-party entities would be able to do the new state-required vision test for driver's license renewals.\nJackson confirmed the vision test would not be an issue.\n\"They would have to have the refraction machine in these locations just like they would at the 34 driver's license centers,\" he said.\nIn addition to wanting more driver's license renewal location options, Kentuckians have also been asking lawmakers to allow more options for driver's tests, Rep. Tom Smith, R-Corbin, said.\nSmith asked Jackson if allowing sheriff's departments to be trained to offer driver's tests is something he considered. Currently, only Kentucky State Police can administer driver's tests.\nJackson said HB 161 only focuses on renewals, but it might be something the general assembly considers in the future.\n\"We didn't deal with that in this,\" he said. \"We wanted to basically stick our toe in the water and try renewals this way, but I could see in the future that possibly would be something that we could do.\"\nHB 161 is now before the full House for consideration.\nLawmakers resume 2025 session with action on key income tax measure\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky General Assembly reconvened in Frankfort this week for Part II of the 2025 legislative session, and lawmakers were eager to begin moving bills on health care, gubernatorial pardons and public safety.\nClose to 20 bills have passed out of committee so far, and a handful have cleared at least one chamber. But no measure has advanced with more momentum than House Bill 1, the latest step in a multi-year effort to gradually reduce and eliminate Kentucky's income tax.The legislation was resting close to the finish line when lawmakers concluded the first part of the session in January. The Senate wasted no time Tuesday passing the bill off the chamber floor and sending it to the governor's desk.\nHB 1 will cut Kentucky's income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% beginning next year. The measure has carried bipartisan support this session even as lawmakers in both chambers have sparred over the impact of tax cuts. The governor signed the bill on Thursday, making it the first bill to become law in 2025.\nThe Senate was also moving deliberately this week on Senate Bill 17, which seeks to create a statutory and regulatory framework to operate freestanding birthing centers in Kentucky.\nDifferent versions of the bill have been discussed for years as supporters have sought to find common ground among a wide gamut of stakeholders.\nThe latest proposal appears to be advancing with more support. It won passage in the Senate Health Services Committee on Wednesday and advanced off the Senate floor Friday with a 34-0 vote and three pass votes.\nAnother measure clearing the Senate was Senate Bill 126, which proposes to amend the state constitution and limit the governor's ability to grant pardons or commutations either just before an election or in the final months before they leave office.\nSB 126 advanced out of the Senate State and Local Government Committee on Wednesday and breezed off the Senate floor Friday with a near-unanimous vote.\nIf the bill wins final passage this year, Kentucky voters would still need to ratify the amendment before it could take effect.\nMeanwhile in the House, a bill that seeks to prevent choking deaths in schools took an early step after the mother of 8-year-old Landon McCubbins provided moving testimony to the House Primary and Secondary Education Committee.\nLandon died at school in 2022 while choking on a bouncy ball, and House Bill 44 would clear the way for schools to deploy anti-choking devices in such cases after other attempts to save a student's life have failed.\nIt won committee approval Wednesday and now heads to the full House.\nAlso on Wednesday, the Senate Transportation Committee moved a bill that would levy a new $200 fee against \"super speeders,\" a proposed term for those convicted of driving more than 25 miles per hour over the speed limit on a state highway.\nRevenue from the legislation – Senate Bill 57 – would help fund Kentucky's emergency trauma network.\nSexual extortion was another issue to capture attention this week after the Senate Judiciary Committee heard stirring testimony Thursday on Senate Bill 73. The measure seeks to make sexual extortion a felony in Kentucky and provide victims with more legal remedies.\nCommittee members voted 7-0 to send the bill to the full Senate.\nTwenty-two days remain in this year's short, 30-day session, and lawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday in the Old State Capitol building in downtown Frankfort.\nThe Old Capitol served as the center of state government from 1830 to 1910, and in a nod to legislative history, the General Assembly typically conducts floor proceedings in the building once each session.\nAs always, Kentuckians can track the action this year through the Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced a bill Thursday to combat sexual extortion in Kentucky after hearing impassioned testimony.\nSen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, is sponsor of Senate Bill 73, which she said would strengthen laws by making sexual extortion a felony and empower victims by giving them clear legal remedies to seek justice and recover damages, among other measures.\"Sexual extortion is one of the most dangerous and rapidly growing crimes targeting young people today. It is calculated, it is cruel and it thrives on fear and silence,\" she said. \"Too many kids today are being manipulated into situations that they don't know how to escape from.\"\nAdams defined sextortion as a form of exploitation that occurs when someone obtains sexually explicit images – sometimes generated by artificial intelligence – of someone and threatens to release them unless their demands are met. That might include monetary, sexual or any other requests. Abusers often use social media platforms, online gaming sites and messaging applications to target victims.\nTestifying with Adams were bill advocates Sara Collins, a Louisville-based attorney, and Lady Tee Thompson, who fights against human trafficking and advocates for human rights.\n\"I'm here with an appeal – a plea on behalf of our children, our communities, our humanity. The crisis of sextortion and sextortion-based trafficking is not a shadow lingering in some distant land. It is here. It is real. It is devouring the innocence of our youth,\" Thompson said.\nCollins said she testified on behalf of a client who is known as \"Jane Doe,\" and whose story is unforgettable and illustrates how important passage of the bill is.\n\"No one is exempt from being a victim, and predators are very difficult to identify,\" she said\nCollins testified that in 2020, a former Louisville Metro police detective sexually extorted at least 25 women, and she called him a \"very dangerous predator.\"\n\"He is not a registered sex offender. He has internet access. And, my client, who is one of his victims, phoned me a few months ago to tell me she ran into him in Kroger,\" Collins said.\nShe pointed out that the bill must pass because criminal and civil law – federal or in Kentucky – inadequately addresses sexual extortion.\n\"Currently, sextortion is prosecuted both civilly and criminally under a patchwork of laws that really do not address the problem,\" Collins said.\nSen. Matthew Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, thanked the three women who testified and said Adams' legislative work to fight sexual assault, abuse and sexual extortion is commendable. He said he looks forward to supporting the bill on the Senate floor.\n\"As a former principal, I see this rampantly throughout our school systems, and I appreciate the efforts to curtail this,\" he said.\nSen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, also vice chair of the committee, said he agrees with most of the measures in the bill and \"extortion in and of itself is both a criminal and a civil offense.\"\nWheeler asked about a portion of the bill dealing with suicide and how it would be judged in statute.\nAdams said this portion could be clarified, and she's open to a floor amendment.\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, said it's terrible that those who commit sexual extortion keep ahead \"on how to do these dastardly things,\" and he appreciates the legislation.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said sexual extortion is very real, and he wants to do everything he can to protect his young granddaughters.\nAdams said it's time to protect children against sexual extortion and she looks forward to working on the bill as it moves forward.\n\"The perpetrators move faster than our laws do,\" she said. \"I'm excited to make this bill even stronger and better and without any unintended consequences.\"\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky General Assembly will celebrate the rich history of the legislature next week by convening for a day in the Old State Capitol building in downtown Frankfort.\nThe Kentucky Senate and House of Representatives will gavel into session at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 11, inside the building's historic chambers. The Old Capitol, located at 300 W. Broadway St., is a National Historic Landmark that served as the center of state government from 1830 to 1910.\"Kentucky has a rich and storied history. I always enjoy visiting the Old Capitol and reflecting on the influential figures who helped shape the Commonwealth we call home today,\" said Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester. \"As we honor those who came before us, we also celebrate their legacy and the heritage of 'My Old Kentucky Home.'\"\nHouse Speaker David W. Osborne, R-Prospect, added, \"Our historic Old State Capitol witnessed several critical chapters in Kentucky's history and today serves as a reminder that our Commonwealth has overcome great challenges and emerged stronger than ever. Lawmakers have stood within the walls of the House and Senate and debated the merits of suffrage, secession, and the adoption of two state constitutions. Our visit underscores the General Assembly's enduring commitment to enacting legislation that reflects our state's evolving needs, while preserving the values of our citizens, essentially shaping the course of our shared history and future.\"\nKentuckians can view the proceedings via livestream on Kentucky Educational Television's website at www.ket.org/legislature Proceedings will also be broadcast on KET KY, the Kentucky Channel.\nCredentialed media will be admitted into the Old Capitol chambers as space permits. Interested media should contact Laura Leigh Goins at Laura.Goins@kylegislature.gov about space availability in the House and Angela Billings at Angela.Billings@kylegislature.gov about space availability in the Senate.\nBoth the House and Senate plan to adjourn for the day at the Old Capitol and will not return to the present-day Capitol for proceedings on the floors.\nThe Old State Capitol, completed in 1830 and used until 1910, is a vital part of Kentucky's history as a center of significant legislative activity and an architectural gem.\nAs the third of four capitol buildings in the state, the Old State Capitol is a symbol of Kentucky's democratic values and civic pride. Designed in the Greek Revival style, the building embodies the ideals of democracy and serves as a lasting reminder of the state's early years and political evolution.\nBeyond its role as the seat of government, the Old State Capitol is where some of Kentucky's most influential leaders debated and made decisions on issues that defined the nation's future. Topics such as slavery, secession, women's rights and civil rights were central to discussions that shaped Kentucky's trajectory during a period of profound political and social change.\nNow a National Historic Landmark, the Kentucky Historical Society (KHS) manages the Old State Capitol. In addition to preserving the building's architectural significance, KHS is committed to transforming it into a hub for civics education.\nKHS offers a variety of programs, exhibits and tours designed to engage visitors and students with Kentucky's early political history. By exploring the key decisions and debates that took place in this historic space, KHS fosters reflection on how those choices continue to shape the state and its people today.\nMore information about the Old State Capitol is available on the Kentucky Historical Society website.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Transportation Committee advanced a bill Wednesday that would levy a new $200 fee against \"super speeders\" to help fund an emergency trauma network in Kentucky.\nThe legislation, Senate Bill 57, cleared the committee with a 7-1 vote. Under the proposal, a motorist would be considered a \"super speeder\" if convicted of driving more than 25 miles per hour over the speed limit on a state highway.Fees collected from such speeders would be used to boost Kentucky's trauma care system fund, a rural hospital preservation fund, an emergency medical technician scholarship fund, and a fund to help public schools purchase automated external defibrillators.\nThe bill's sponsor, Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, said the measure is modeled after legislation in Georgia. He said the Kentucky legislature passed a bill in 2008 to establish a trauma care network, but it has never received an appropriation.\n\"One of my frequent complaints as a legislator here is that we never measure the cost of doing nothing, and certainly by not funding this network has cost us dearly not just in terms of lives – probably during that period we lost 85,000 lives due to trauma – average about 5,000 a year,\" he said. \"And if we had a network in place, probably conservatively, we could have saved at least 5,000 lives.\"\nMeredith said many trauma patients have had to leave Kentucky to receive treatment, and millions of Medicaid dollars have been spent in other states.\nDr. Zachary D. Warriner, a trauma surgeon at the University of Kentucky, testified he's originally from Southeastern Kentucky, and providing appropriate trauma care for everyone in the state is paramount.\n\"I'm proud to be from here. I'm not proud of some of our trauma outcomes despite the fact that we've implemented this system in 2008,\" he said. \"I think that it's startling to me that depending on where you fall or wreck your vehicle in our state, that your likelihood of survival can be dramatically altered just based on that geography.\"\nHe said if the legislature earmarks funds adequately, there will be a dramatic impact on Kentuckians' lives and there is data to support that.\nSen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, asked Meredith about the number of tickets being issued on limited access highways versus urban areas. He voted against the measure, citing the funding mechanism.\n\"I think we can agree that if you're going 25 miles and over in the middle of a city, that's dangerous, and I can see a reason for a super speeder fine,\" he said. \"If you're trying to get home at 10 o'clock at night, and there's nobody on a limited access highway at all, frankly I would just adopt Montana's reasonable and prudent standard. And as long as you're not being unsafe, then I don't really think you should have to pay an additional fine.\"\nSen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said he's concerned about air ambulance bills and asked if a fund or pool could be set up to help families defray the costs of services.\nMeredith said the network needs to be built, but he envisions some way to address this issue.\n\"It's economically killing for a lot of families,\" he said of the costs. \"We have to build the system first.\"\nSen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, said he supports the bill and supports improving the trauma treatment situation in Northern Kentucky.\n\"Right now, there is children's hospital, which is a Level 1 pediatric center in Cincinnati. Would love to open a hospital in Northern Kentucky, and they're prevented by certificate of need from doing so,\" he said.\nMeredith said the bill could change the trajectory of health care in Kentucky for almost every citizen.\n\"The other option that could be available to us if this bill doesn't pass is we have an appropriation request in the next budget cycle for $10 million. We know that's not going to happen, so this is a way to fund this system without costing the taxpayers any additional tax burden,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — In 2022, 8-year-old Landon McCubbins choked on a bouncy ball in a Nelson County classroom.\nHis mother, Lauren McCubbins, told the House Primary and Secondary Education Committee on Wednesday her son died after all efforts to dislodge the bouncy ball from Landon's throat failed.\nRep. Candy Massaroni, R-Bardstown, said House Bill 44, also known as Landon's Law, could prevent what happened to Landon from happening to another Kentucky child. She is the primary sponsor of the legislation.\n\"Schools will be allowed to have life-saving, anti-choking devices in their schools while removing the liability from the schools (under this bill),\" Massaroni said. \"Choking is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for children under the age of 18.\"\nThe bill defines an anti-choking device as \"a portable suction device used to remove an airway obstruction during a choking emergency that has been registered as a Class II medical device with the United States Food and Drug Administration.\"\nThe device would be an option, not a requirement, for schools, according to the legislation.\nLauren McCubbins said HB 44 is something Landon would support. Weeks before he died, Landon wrote in his journal at school: \"One future technology that will change our lives is a robot that will help paramedics save people's lives.\"\n\"This is an 8-year-old child wanting technology that will help save lives and hoping that our future is better,\" Lauren McCubbins said. \"We are not asking you to skip all other emergency protocols. We are asking you to allow LifeVacs in schools to use them when there is no other option.\"\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, asked Massaroni and McCubbins to describe the LifeVac device.\nMassaroni said a LifeVac is a simple, non-invasive device that fits over a child or adult's mouth. It uses suction to remove an obstruction from someone's throat. She said the device is registered with the FDA and in the process of becoming FDA approved.\n\"The CDC came out and recommended that anybody that wants to be ADA compliant should get them,\" Massaroni added.\nRep. Emily Callaway, R-Louisville, asked Massaroni if the Heimlich maneuver is included in the legislation.\nMassaroni said the legislation recommends typical protocols prior to using the LifeVac device, and the Heimlich maneuver is one of the first. The device is an alternative if the Heimlich maneuver does not work, she said.\nLauren McCubbins believes a LifeVac could have saved her son's life.\n\"A LifeVac is an alternative to dying,\" she said. \"Those emergency protocols failed my sweet boy on 11/21/22. There was not a LifeVac in school to even attempt to save him. My son may still be alive had there been. We are here today hoping that this never happens to any child again.\"\nThe House Primary and Secondary Education Committee unanimously approved Landon's Law. It now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A measure to cut the income tax rate in Kentucky – House Bill 1 – was the first bill in 2025 to gain Senate approval.\nWith a 34-3 vote on Tuesday, the Senate approved the measure that would reduce the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% beginning Jan. 1, 2026. The House approved the bill in early January by a 90-7 vote and it now heads to the governor.\nSen. Christian McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, and chair of the Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee, said the general assembly created certain \"triggers\" several years ago to allow for the gradual lowering of the Kentucky income tax. The triggers require state coffers to meet savings and surplus thresholds before the tax rate can be lowered.\n\"It's been said that there are only two things in life that are certain: death and taxes,\" McDaniel said. \"…In the last seven years, we've added another thing that's fairly certain, which is the general assembly is going to do everything in its power, and frequently with success, to lower your taxes. And that's what House Bill 1 is all about.\"\nSen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, voted for the bill, and said it's part of a \"journey\" to reduce the state income tax rate to zero.\n\"Let's tackle the root of the problem by controlling spending and empowering our citizens. This tax cut will boost our economy and put more money back in the pockets of Kentuckians,\" he said. \"I vote yes for growth, yes for fiscal responsibility and yes for the future of the prosperity of our great state.\"\nHowever, a few lawmakers cited concerns with the plan during debate on the chamber floor.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, voted against the measure. She acknowledged that the bill is popular, but said it is \"putting way too many apples in a basket we can't get a hold of if we need.\" She also said she's concerned about risks with the bourbon industry in Kentucky and tariffs.\n\"Obviously, these are things that sound very attractive to people, very attractive,\" Berg said. \"I may be socially liberal, but I am extremely fiscally conservative, and I honestly know that sound finances is that you pay your bills first. You make sure that you're solvent, and you have enough money to cover exigencies as they come across.\"\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, also voted against the bill. She said she appreciates the intent of the legislation. However, she's concerned that the people who are making the most money stand to receive the most benefits from the reduction.\n\"I also worry about cutting our revenues at a time of such economic uncertainty. We don't know what tariffs, if any, might be coming. We don't know what federal funds, if any, might be going away. We don't know what impact, if any, that's going to have on us here in this state,\" she said.\nBut Sen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, argued in favor, saying it's a great thing for people to keep more of their money.\n\"They earned it. It's their money, not ours. We think we know better what to do with their money than they do. I'm telling you, we do not,\" he said.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, also voted for the bill, and said the measure shouldn't have anything to do with partisanship.\n\"I tried to talk to our nonbiased economic advisers about what would happen in going from a 4% to a 3.5% in our climate today is still safe. I do have fears of the future and I know how hard it is in order to reverse something like this,\" he said.\nThe Senate is adjourned until Wednesday at 2 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky lawmakers spent the first week of the 2025 legislative session electing leaders, adopting rules for the chambers, and advancing a high-priority bill on tax reform close to the finish line.\nFriday marked day four of this year's short, 30-day session, and winter weather hasn't hampered the action in Frankfort. Legislators have filed more than 200 bills since the chambers gaveled into session on Tuesday.\nThe proposals touch everything from education and crime to more specific topics like water fluoridation, and they offer a glimpse of the issues lawmakers might look to tackle in the coming months.\nMajority lawmakers in both chambers have been signaling for weeks that tax reform would receive focus early in the session, and that proposal – House Bill 1 – was the only measure to begin moving this week.\nThe legislation is part of a multi-year effort to gradually reduce and eliminate Kentucky's income tax – so long as the state continues to meet certain revenue thresholds.\nHB 1 would cut the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% starting in 2026. It cleared the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee on Wednesday and advanced off the House floor Thursday with a 90-7 vote after proponents staved off nearly a dozen floor amendments.\nDuring the hour-long debate, supporters said the change will encourage more growth and development in Kentucky while helping ease the burden on taxpayers. Critics, however, raised concerns that it will mostly benefit high earners and rob the state coffers of important revenue.\nThe Senate received the bill late Thursday, and the Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee took up the measure Friday morning, voting 11-0 to send HB 1 to the chamber floor for consideration during Part II of the session.\nIn addition to the tax discussion, the House and Senate welcomed a new class of legislators this week. Twenty-two new members were sworn into the General Assembly on Tuesday, including 16 in the House and six in the Senate.\nBoth chambers also saw a handful of leadership changes.\nIn the House, Rep. Pamela Stevenson, D-Louisville, will now serve as minority floor leader; Rep. Al Gentry, D-Louisville, will serve as minority caucus chair; and Rep. Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, will serve as minority whip.\nIn the Senate, Sen. Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, was elected as majority floor leader; and Sen. Robby Mills, R-Henderson, will serve as majority caucus chair.\nOther leadership roles remained unchanged from last year.\nUnder the state constitution, the Kentucky General Assembly convenes in short sessions during odd-numbered years. The calendar calls for four session days in January. Then the chambers gavel out until Part II begins in February.\nThis year, lawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on Feb. 4 and gavel out sine die on March 28.\nKentuckians can track the action through the Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — House Bill 1 became the first bill to advance off the House floor in 2025 on Thursday.\nSponsored by Rep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, HB 1 would reduce the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% beginning Jan. 1, 2026.\nPetrie said the general assembly's journey to reducing the state income tax began in 2018, but picked up steam in 2022 with House Bill 8. HB 8 established a \"trigger\" system, which allows the legislature to reduce the income tax rate by either a half or a full percentage point if state revenues reach certain levels.\n\"It is before this body again, per formula, as a good, methodical, thoughtful, cautious approach to reducing the individual income tax rate to zero over time, but not so fast we hurt ourselves, or – more importantly – our constituents,\" Petrie said.\nEleven amendments were filed to make changes to HB 1 on the floor. Rep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, attempted to amend HB 1 to reduce the income tax to 3% in 2025 and bring it to zero by 2028.\n\"States like Texas, Tennessee and Florida have no individual income tax, which has been a significant draw for businesses and entrepreneurs seeking to minimize their tax burden,\" Doan said. \"By aligning with these states, Kentucky will be poised to see an influx of new businesses and residents, stimulating economic growth.\"\nThe House did not vote on the amendment after it was ruled unconstitutional by House Speaker David W. Osborne, R-Prospect. Petrie said reducing the income tax too quickly would lead to a \"severe\" budget deficit, which is against the Kentucky Constitution.\nRep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, also tried to amend HB 1. She suggested amending the bill to introduce a graduated income tax system, adding she has concerns over the future funding of public education under a consumption-based tax structure.\nBeginning in 2026, individuals making less than $90,000 annually would be taxed at 3.5% under her proposal. Her amendment would also put individuals making $90,000 to $100,000 in net income to be taxed at 3.75% and individuals making more than $100,000 a year to be taxed at 4%.\n\"Amendment 8 will provide a larger budget revenue stream for Kentucky, fulfill the majority's efforts to cut taxes for Kentuckians, and also give a greater tax cut and greater financial relief to the people who need it most,\" Camuel said.\nPetrie said he doesn't support Camuel's amendment because HB 1 is designed to reduce the tax burden for all Kentuckians.\nCamuel's amendment was not adopted.\nRep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, was one of many lawmakers to speak on HB 1 during a more than an hour-long debate on the bill. He said he would be voting \"yes\" on the legislation, but he still has concerns.\n\"I wish the bill focused more on our working-class families, and was not drafted to disproportionally help those who have the most,\" Aull said.\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, said he has seen the evolution of tax reform in Kentucky since he joined the general assembly in 2017 and it hasn't happened \"in a vacuum,\" but with careful consideration and conservative budgeting practices.\n\"This is a conservative approach to a conservative goal,\" Nemes said. \"This is a long play, and that's the reason we're doing this: to help the individual taxpayer, and to grow the pie for all of our people, and we have done that.\"\nThe House approved HB 1 by a 90-7 vote. It will now go before the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Kentuckians may see another state income tax cut next year.\nThe House Appropriations and Revenue Committee started the process of reducing the state income tax from 4% to 3.5% beginning Jan. 1, 2026, by approving House Bill 1 on Wednesday.\nCommittee Chair Rep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, said HB 1 is the next step in a process that began with House Bill 8 in 2022 to reduce the state income tax. Petrie is the primary sponsor of HB 1.\nHB 8 established \"triggers\" that permit the general assembly to lower the state income tax rate by either a half or full percentage point once state revenues reach certain levels.\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, asked Petrie what would happen if future projections indicate the general assembly should reverse the tax cut.\nPetrie said there are several ways the legislature could address the issue.\n\"You would reverse it by statutory amendment modification, just like we're doing in a different direction today,\" Petrie said. \"Or you would focus on budget, or you would focus on revenues and expenditures … those are three easy places to go.\"\nJason Bailey, executive director for the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said Kentucky will face budgetary issues if cuts are made to the state income tax.\n\"A recent state forecast predicted revenues will decline by $213 million this year, and the state will face a shortfall,\" Bailey said.\nIn continuing the discussion on HB 1, House Minority Caucus Chair Al Gentry, D-Louisville, asked Petrie about the state moving toward an all consumption-based tax structure and working toward becoming a zero-income tax state.\n\"What is the general reason for doing that? Is it trying to promote growth for people moving into the state?\" Gentry asked.\nPetrie said that there is evidence that supports the theory that a lower income tax will lead to population and economic growth.\n\"There's a good amount of support for the theory that as the income tax becomes much more competitive with other states, there's reason for people to stay here, as well as locate here, as well as economic growth,\" Petrie said.\nThe committee approved HB 1 by a 17-0 vote with three members passing.\nGentry recorded a \"pass\" vote on HB 1 in committee, but said he may vote in favor of the legislation on the floor once he does more research.\n\"I don't see any reason to vote 'no' on this bill yet other than not really being in 100% agreement on the entire model of going to where we're going, because I feel like it benefits higher income people at the expense of lower income people,\" Gentry said.\nHB 1 will now go before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — State lawmakers are set to convene in Frankfort next week for the 2025 Regular Session of the Kentucky General Assembly, and Kentuckians have many ways to follow along with the action.\nKentuckians can use online resources to:\n-- See the General Assembly’s daily schedule\n-- Tune in to live coverage of legislative\nmeetings\n-- Find information on their legislators\n-- Contact lawmakers and offer feedback\n-- Read bills and resolutions\n-- Receive a notice when a bill advances\n-- See how lawmakers voted on bills and\nresolutions\n-- View materials on committee topics and\ntestimony\n-- Learn about the legislative process\nAll that and much more is available on the General Assembly Home Page: https://legislature.ky.gov/pages/index.aspx.\nFollowing the General Assembly’s work often begins with a daily look at the Legislative Calendar: https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/LegislativeCalendar.

Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period in the United States in which Cold War tensions fueled fears of widespread communist subversion.[1] He alleged that numerous communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the United States federal government, universities, film industry,[2][3] and elsewhere. Ultimately he was censured by the Senate in 1954 for refusing to cooperate with and abusing members of the committee established to investigate whether or not he should be censured. The term \"McCarthyism\", coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, was soon applied to similar anti-communist activities. Today the term is used more broadly to mean demagogic, reckless, and unsubstantiated accusations, as well as public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents.[4][5]\nBorn in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, McCarthy commissioned into the Marine Corps in 1942, where he served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron. Following the end of World War II, he attained the rank of major. He volunteered to fly twelve combat missions as a gunner-observer. These missions were generally safe, and after one where he was allowed to shoot as much ammunition as he wanted, mainly at coconut trees, he acquired the nickname \"Tail-Gunner Joe\". Some of his claims of heroism were later shown to be exaggerated or falsified, leading many of his critics to use \"Tail-Gunner Joe\" as a term of mockery.[6][7][8]\nA Democrat until 1944, McCarthy successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1946 as a Republican, narrowly defeating incumbent Robert M. La Follette Jr. in the Wisconsin Republican primary, then Democratic challenger Howard McMurray by a 61% – 37% margin. After three largely undistinguished years in the Senate, McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame in February 1950 when he asserted in a speech that he had a list of \"members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring\" who were employed in the State Department.[9] In succeeding years after his 1950 speech, McCarthy made additional accusations of Communist infiltration into the State Department, the administration of President Harry S. Truman, the Voice of America, and the U.S. Army. He also used various charges of communism, communist sympathies, disloyalty, or sex crimes to attack a number of politicians and other individuals inside and outside of government.[10] This included a concurrent \"Lavender Scare\" against suspected homosexuals, whose illicit sexual activity was presumed to make them vulnerable to blackmail by communists and others.[11]\nWith the highly publicized Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954, and following the suicide of Wyoming Senator Lester C. Hunt that same year,[12] McCarthy's support and popularity faded. On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy by a vote of 67–22, making him one of the few senators ever to be disciplined in this fashion. He continued to rail against communism and socialism until his death at the age of 48 at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on May 2, 1957, though doctors had not previously reported him to be seriously ill.[13] His death certificate listed the cause of death as \"Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown\",[14] which some biographers say was caused or exacerbated by alcoholism.[15]\nEarly life and education\n[edit]Joseph Raymond McCarthy was born on November 14, 1908, on a farm in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, the fifth of nine children.[16][17] His mother, Bridget McCarthy (nee Tierney), was from County Tipperary, Ireland. His father, Timothy McCarthy, was born in the United States, the son of an Irish father and a German mother. McCarthy dropped out of junior high school at age 14 to help his parents manage their farm. He entered Little Wolf High School, in Manawa, Wisconsin, when he was 20 and graduated in one year.[18]\nHe attended Marquette University from 1930 to 1935. McCarthy worked odd jobs while at college, including as a dishwasher, parking-lot attendant, and boxing coach.[19] He first studied electrical engineering for two years, then law, and received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1935 from Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee.[20]\nCareer\n[edit]McCarthy was admitted to the bar in 1935. While working at a law firm in Shawano, Wisconsin, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for district attorney as a Democrat in 1936. During his years as an attorney, McCarthy made money on the side by gambling.[21]\nIn 1939, McCarthy had better success when he ran for the nonpartisan elected post of 10th District circuit judge.[22][23] McCarthy became the youngest circuit judge in the state's history by defeating incumbent Edgar V. Werner, who had been a judge for 24 years.[24] In the campaign, McCarthy lied about Werner's age of 66, claiming that he was 73, and so allegedly too old and infirm to handle the duties of his office.[25] Writing of Werner in Reds: McCarthyism In Twentieth-Century America, Ted Morgan wrote: \"Pompous and condescending, he (Werner) was disliked by lawyers. His judgements had often been reversed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and he was so inefficient that he had piled up a huge backlog of cases.\"[26]\nMcCarthy's judicial career attracted some controversy because of the speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited from Werner.[27] Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority.[28] When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard,[29] but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.[30]\nMilitary service\n[edit]In 1942, shortly after the U.S. entered World War II, McCarthy joined the United States Marine Corps, despite the fact that his judicial office exempted him from military service.[31] His college education qualified him for a direct commission, and he entered the Marines as a first lieutenant.[32]\nAccording to Morgan, writing in Reds, McCarthy's friend and campaign manager, attorney and judge Urban P. Van Susteren, had applied for active duty in the U.S. Army Air Forces in early 1942, and advised McCarthy: \"Be a hero—join the Marines.\"[33][34] When McCarthy seemed hesitant, Van Susteren asked, \"You got shit in your blood?\"[35]\nHe served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron VMSB-235 in the Solomon Islands and Bougainville for 30 months (August 1942 – February 1945), and held the rank of captain at the time he resigned his commission in April 1945.[36] He volunteered to fly twelve combat missions as a gunner-observer. These missions were generally safe, and after one where he was allowed to shoot as much ammunition as he wanted, mainly at coconut trees, he acquired the nickname \"Tail-Gunner Joe\".[37] McCarthy remained in the Marine Corps Reserve after the war, attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel.[38][39]\nHe later falsely claimed participation in 32 aerial missions so as to qualify for a Distinguished Flying Cross and multiple awards of the Air Medal, which the Marine Corps decided to approve in 1952 under his political influence.[40][41] McCarthy also publicly claimed a letter of commendation from his commanding officer and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Chief of Naval Operations.[42][43] However, his commander revealed that McCarthy had written this letter himself, probably while preparing award citations and commendation letters for his men, and that he had signed his commander's name, after which Nimitz signed it routinely.[44][43] A \"war wound\"—a badly broken leg—that McCarthy attributed to varying adventures involving airplane crashes or anti-aircraft fire, had in fact happened aboard ship during a raucous celebration for sailors crossing the equator for the first time.[45][46][47] Because of McCarthy's various lies about his military heroism, his \"Tail-Gunner Joe\" nickname was used in mockery by his critics.[6][7][8]\nMcCarthy campaigned for the Republican Senate nomination in Wisconsin while still on active duty in 1944 but was defeated by Alexander Wiley, the incumbent. After he left the Marines in April 1945, five months before the end of the Pacific war in September 1945, McCarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position. He then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate primary nomination, with support from Thomas Coleman, the Republican Party's political boss in Wisconsin. In this race, he was challenging three-term senator Robert M. La Follette Jr., founder of the Wisconsin Progressive Party and son of the celebrated Wisconsin governor and senator Robert M. La Follette Sr.\nSenate campaign\n[edit]In his campaign, McCarthy attacked La Follette for not enlisting during the war, although La Follette had been 46 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, had been away fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (equal to $763,188 today). Where McCarthy got the money to invest in the first place remains a mystery. La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.[48]\nAccording to Jack Anderson and Ronald W. May,[49] McCarthy's campaign funds, much of them from out of state, were ten times more than La Follette's and McCarthy's vote benefited from a Communist Party vendetta against La Follette. The suggestion that La Follette had been guilty of war profiteering was deeply damaging, and McCarthy won the primary nomination 207,935 votes to 202,557. It was during this campaign that McCarthy started publicizing his war-time nickname \"Tail-Gunner Joe,\" using the slogan, \"Congress needs a tail-gunner.\" Journalist Arnold Beichman later stated that McCarthy \"was elected to his first term in the Senate with support from the Communist-controlled United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, CIO\", which preferred McCarthy to the anti-communist Robert M. La Follette.[50]\nIn the general election against Democratic opponent Howard J. McMurray, McCarthy won 61.2% to McMurray's 37.3%, and thus joined Alexander Wiley, whom he had challenged unsuccessfully two years earlier, in the Senate.\n| Party | Candidate | Votes | % | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Republican | Joseph McCarthy | 620,430 | 61.2 | |\n| Democratic | Howard McMurray | 378,772 | 37.3 | |\n| Total votes | 999,202 | 98.5 | ||\n| Republican hold |\nPersonal life\n[edit]In 1950, McCarthy assaulted journalist Drew Pearson in the cloakroom at the Sulgrave Club, reportedly kneeing him in the groin. McCarthy, who admitted the assault, claimed he merely \"slapped\" Pearson.[51] In 1952, using rumors collected by Pearson as well as other sources, Nevada publisher Hank Greenspun wrote that McCarthy was a frequent patron at the White Horse Inn, a Milwaukee gay bar, and cited his involvement with young men. Greenspun named some of McCarthy's alleged lovers, including Charles E. Davis, an ex-Communist and \"confessed homosexual\" who claimed that he had been hired by McCarthy to spy on U.S. diplomats in Switzerland.[52][53]\nMcCarthy's FBI file also contains numerous allegations, including a 1952 letter from an Army lieutenant who said, \"When I was in Washington some time ago, [McCarthy] picked me up at the bar in the Wardman [Hotel] and took me home, and while I was half-drunk he committed sodomy on me.\" J. Edgar Hoover conducted a perfunctory investigation of the Senator's alleged sexual assault; Hoover's take was that \"homosexuals are very bitter against Senator McCarthy for his attack upon those who are supposed to be in the Government.\"[54][55]\nAlthough some notable McCarthy biographers have rejected these rumors,[56] others have suggested that he may have been blackmailed. Allegations against McCarthy not only involved accusations of homosexuality, but also inappropriate behavior towards young women, particularly after drinking. In his autobiography, Walter Trohan (who was one of McCarthy's close supporters at the time) stated that \"he just couldn't keep his hands off young girls\", and that the communists could have \"plant[ed] a minor on him and raised the cry of statutory rape\".[57] Curt Gentry, in his biography of Hoover, cited rumors among FBI employees that the director had a secret file containing affidavits of such conduct, including towards children younger than ten.[58] During the early 1950s, McCarthy launched a series of attacks on the CIA, claiming it had been infiltrated by communist agents. Allen Dulles, who suspected McCarthy was using information supplied by Hoover, refused to cooperate. According to the historian David Talbot, Dulles also compiled a \"scandalous\" intimate dossier on the Senator's personal life and used the homosexual stories to take him down.[59]\nIn any event, McCarthy did not sue Greenspun for libel. He was told that if the case went ahead he would be compelled to take the witness stand and to rebut the charges made in the affidavit of the young man, which was the basis for Greenspun's story.\nIn 1953, he married Jean Fraser Kerr, a researcher in his office. In January 1957, McCarthy and his wife adopted an infant with the help of Roy Cohn's close friend Cardinal Francis Spellman. They named the baby girl Tierney Elizabeth McCarthy.[60]\nUnited States Senate\n[edit]Senator McCarthy's first three years in the Senate were unremarkable.[61] McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many different organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate,[62] who was often widely criticized.[63]\nMcCarthy was active in labor-management issues, with a reputation as a moderate Republican. He fought against continuation of wartime price controls, especially on sugar. His advocacy in this area was associated by critics with a $20,000 personal loan McCarthy received from a Pepsi bottling executive, earning the Senator the derisive nickname \"The Pepsi-Cola Kid\".[64]\nMcCarthy supported the Taft–Hartley Act over Truman's veto, angering labor unions in Wisconsin but solidifying his business base.[65]\nMalmedy massacre trial\n[edit]In an incident for which he would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given to a group of Waffen-SS soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war. McCarthy was critical of the convictions because the German soldiers' confessions were allegedly obtained through torture during the interrogations. He argued that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.[66]\nShortly after this, a 1950 poll of the Senate press corps voted McCarthy \"the worst U.S. senator\" currently in office.[67]\nMcCarthy biographer Larry Tye has written that antisemitism factored into McCarthy's outspoken views on Malmedy, and noted that McCarthy frequently used anti-Jewish slurs.[68] In this and McCarthy's other characteristics, such as the enthusiastic support he received from antisemitic politicians like Ku Klux Klansman Wesley Swift and his tendency, according to friends, to refer to his copy of Mein Kampf, stating, \"That's the way to do it,\" McCarthy's critics characterize him as driven by antisemitism. However, Tye argues that McCarthy's criticisms of the Malmedy trial were driven not only by antisemitism, but by opportunism to gain favor with the political right by scapegoating marginalized groups.[68]\nIt was later found that McCarthy had received \"evidence\" of the false torture claims from Rudolf Aschenauer, a prominent Neo-Nazi agitator who often served as a defense attorney for Nazi war criminals, such as Einsatzgruppen commander Otto Ohlendorf.[69]\n\"Enemies within\"\n[edit]McCarthy experienced a meteoric rise in national profile beginning on February 9, 1950, when he gave a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. His words in the speech are a matter of some debate, as no audio recording survives. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted as having said: \"The State Department is infested with communists. I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.\"[70][71]\nThere is some dispute with whether or not McCarthy actually gave the number of people on the list as being \"205\" or \"57\". In a later telegram to President Truman, and when entering the speech into the Congressional Record, he used the number 57.[72]\nThe origin of the number 205 can be traced: in later debates on the Senate floor, McCarthy referred to a 1946 letter that then–Secretary of State James Byrnes sent to Congressman Adolph J. Sabath. In that letter, Byrnes said State Department security investigations had resulted in \"recommendation against permanent employment\" for 284 persons, and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs; this left 205 still on the State Department's payroll. In fact, by the time of McCarthy's speech only about 65 of the employees mentioned in the Byrnes letter were still with the State Department, and all of these had undergone further security checks.[73]\nAt the time of McCarthy's speech, communism was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated by the actions of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.[74][75]\nTydings Committee\n[edit]McCarthy himself was taken aback by the massive media response to the Wheeling speech, and he was accused of continually revising both his charges and figures. In Salt Lake City, Utah, a few days later, he cited a figure of 57, and in the Senate on February 20, 1950, he claimed 81.[76] During a five-hour speech,[77] McCarthy presented a case-by-case analysis of his 81 \"loyalty risks\" employed at the State Department. It is widely accepted that most of McCarthy's cases were selected from the so-called \"Lee list\", a report that had been compiled three years earlier for the House Appropriations Committee. Led by a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent named Robert E. Lee, the House investigators had reviewed security clearance documents on State Department employees, and had determined that there were \"incidents of inefficiencies\"[78] in the security reviews of 108 employees. McCarthy hid the source of his list, stating that he had penetrated the \"iron curtain\" of State Department secrecy with the aid of \"some good, loyal Americans in the State Department\".[79] In reciting the information from the Lee list cases, McCarthy consistently exaggerated, representing the hearsay of witnesses as facts and converting phrases such as \"inclined towards Communism\" to \"a Communist\".[80]\nIn response to McCarthy's charges, the Senate voted unanimously to investigate, and the Tydings Committee hearings were called.[81] This was a subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations set up in February 1950 to conduct \"a full and complete study and investigation as to whether persons who are disloyal to the United States are, or have been, employed by the Department of State\".[82]\nMany Democrats were incensed at McCarthy's attack on the State Department of a Democratic administration, and had hoped to use the hearings to discredit him. The Democratic chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Millard Tydings, was reported to have said, \"Let me have him [McCarthy] for three days in public hearings, and he'll never show his face in the Senate again.\"[83]\nDuring the hearings, McCarthy made charges against nine specific people: Dorothy Kenyon, Esther Brunauer, Haldore Hanson, Gustavo Durán, Owen Lattimore, Harlow Shapley, Frederick Schuman, John S. Service, and Philip Jessup. They all had previously been the subject of charges of varying worth and validity. McCarthy came to focus particularly on Lattimore, who at one point he described as a \"top Russian spy\".[citation needed]\nFrom its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by intense partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy's list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. The Tydings Report labeled McCarthy's charges a \"fraud and a hoax,\" and described them as using incensing rhetoric—saying that the result of McCarthy's actions was to \"confuse and divide the American people ... to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves\". Republicans were outraged by the Democratic response. They responded to the report's rhetoric in kind, with William E. Jenner stating that Tydings was guilty of \"the most brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history\".[84] The full Senate voted three times on whether to accept the report, and each time the voting was precisely divided along party lines.[85]\nFame and notoriety\n[edit]From 1950 onward, McCarthy continued to exploit the fear of Communism and to press his accusations that the government was failing to deal with Communism within its ranks. McCarthy also began investigations into homosexuals working in the foreign policy bureaucracy, who were considered prime candidates for blackmail by the Soviets.[86] These accusations received wide publicity, increased his approval rating, and gained him a powerful national following.\nIn Congress, there was little doubt that homosexuals did not belong in sensitive government positions.[86] Since the late 1940s, the government had been dismissing about five homosexuals a month from civilian posts; by 1954, the number had grown twelve-fold.[87] As historian David M. Barrett would write, \"Mixed in with the hysterics were some logic, though: homosexuals faced condemnation and discrimination, and most of them—wishing to conceal their orientation—were vulnerable to blackmail.\"[88] Director of Central Intelligence Roscoe Hillenkoetter was called to Congress to testify on homosexuals being employed at the CIA. He said, \"The use of homosexuals as a control mechanism over individuals recruited for espionage is a generally accepted technique which has been used at least on a limited basis for many years.\" As soon as the DCI said these words, his aide signaled to take the remainder of the DCI's testimony off the record. Political historian David Barrett uncovered Hillenkoetter's notes, which reveal the remainder of the statement: \"While this agency will never employ homosexuals on its rolls, it might conceivably be necessary, and in the past has actually been valuable, to use known homosexuals as agents in the field. I am certain that if Joseph Stalin or a member of the Politburo or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual, no member of this committee or of the Congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations ... after all, intelligence and espionage is, at best, an extremely dirty business.\"[89] The senators reluctantly agreed the CIA had to be flexible.[90]\nMcCarthy's methods also brought on the disapproval and opposition of many. Barely a month after McCarthy's Wheeling speech, the term \"McCarthyism\" was coined by Washington Post cartoonist Herbert Block.[91] Block and others used the word as a synonym for demagoguery, baseless defamation, and mudslinging. Later, it would be embraced by McCarthy and some of his supporters. \"McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled,\" McCarthy said in a 1952 speech, and later that year, he published a book titled McCarthyism: The Fight For America.[citation needed]\nMcCarthy sought to discredit his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being Communists or communist sympathizers. In the 1950 Maryland Senate election, McCarthy campaigned for John Marshall Butler in his race against four-term incumbent Millard Tydings, with whom McCarthy had been in conflict during the Tydings Committee hearings. In speeches supporting Butler, McCarthy accused Tydings of \"protecting Communists\" and \"shielding traitors\". McCarthy's staff was heavily involved in the campaign and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that Tydings was in intimate conversation with Communist leader Earl Russell Browder.[92][93][94] A Senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as \"a despicable, back-street type of campaign\", as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the Senate.[95] The pamphlet was clearly labeled a composite. McCarthy said it was \"wrong\" to distribute it; though staffer Jean Kerr thought it was fine. After he lost the election by almost 40,000 votes, Tydings claimed foul play.\nIn addition to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now regarded as one of the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.[96] A 2014 study found little evidence that McCarthy's campaigning against other Senators mattered in the election outcomes.[97] In the 1952 Senate elections McCarthy was returned to his Senate seat with 54.2% of the vote, compared to Democrat Thomas Fairchild's 45.6%. As of 2020, McCarthy is the last Republican to win Wisconsin's Class 1 Senate seat.\n| Party | Candidate | Votes | % | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Republican | Joseph McCarthy | 870,444 | 54.2 | |\n| Democratic | Thomas E. Fairchild | 731,402 | 45.6 | |\n| Total votes | 1,601,846 | 99.8 | ||\n| Republican hold |\nMcCarthy and the Truman administration\n[edit]McCarthy and President Truman clashed often during the years both held office. McCarthy characterized Truman and the Democratic Party as soft on, or even in league with, Communists, and spoke of the Democrats' \"twenty years of treason\". Truman, in turn, once referred to McCarthy as \"the best asset the Kremlin has\", calling McCarthy's actions an attempt to \"sabotage the foreign policy of the United States\" in a cold war and comparing it to shooting American soldiers in the back in a hot war.[98]\nIt was the Truman Administration's State Department that McCarthy accused of harboring 205 (or 57 or 81) \"known Communists\". Truman's Secretary of Defense, George Marshall, was the target of some of McCarthy's most vitriolic rhetoric. Marshall had been Army Chief of Staff during World War II and was also Truman's former Secretary of State. Marshall was a highly respected general and statesman, remembered today as the architect of victory and peace, the latter based on the Marshall Plan for post-war reconstruction of Europe, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953. McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall, later published in 1951 as a book titled America's Retreat From Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall. Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China, and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the loss of China to Communism. In the speech McCarthy also implied that Marshall was guilty of treason;[99] declared that \"if Marshall were merely stupid, the laws of probability would dictate that part of his decisions would serve this country's interest\";[99] and most famously, accused him of being part of \"a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man\".[99]\nIn December 1950, McCarthy teamed with right-wing radio star Fulton Lewis Jr. to smear Truman's nominee for Assistant Secretary of Defense, Anna M. Rosenberg. Their smear campaign attracted allies in anti-Semites and extremists like Gerald L. K. Smith, who falsely claimed Rosenberg, who was Jewish, was a communist.[100] Unlike other women targets of McCarthyism, Rosenberg emerged with her career and integrity intact. When the smear campaign fizzled out, journalist Edward R. Murrow said \"the character assassin has missed.\"[100]\nDuring the Korean War, when Truman dismissed General Douglas MacArthur, McCarthy charged that Truman and his advisors must have planned the dismissal during late-night sessions when \"they've had time to get the President cheerful\" on bourbon and Bénédictine. McCarthy declared, \"The son of a bitch should be impeached.\"[101]\nSupport from Catholics and the Kennedy family\n[edit]One of the strongest bases of anti-Communist sentiment in the United States was the Catholic community, which constituted over 20% of the national vote. McCarthy identified himself as Catholic, and although the great majority of Catholics were Democrats, as his fame as a leading anti-Communist grew, he became popular in Catholic communities across the country, with strong support from many leading Catholics, diocesan newspapers, and Catholic journals. At the same time, some Catholics opposed McCarthy, notably the anti-Communist author Father John Francis Cronin and the influential journal Commonweal.[102]\nMcCarthy established a bond with the powerful Kennedy family, which had high visibility among Catholics. McCarthy became a close friend of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., himself a fervent anti-Communist, and he was also a frequent guest at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. He dated two of Kennedy's daughters, Patricia and Eunice.[103][104] It has been stated that McCarthy was godfather to Robert F. Kennedy's first child, Kathleen Kennedy. This claim was acknowledged by Robert's wife and Kathleen's mother Ethel,[105] though Kathleen later claimed that she looked at her baptismal certificate and that her actual godfather was Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart professor Daniel Walsh.[105]\nRobert Kennedy was unusual among his Harvard friends for defending McCarthy when they discussed politics after graduation.[106] He was chosen by McCarthy to be a counsel for his investigatory committee, but resigned after six months due to disagreements with McCarthy and Committee Counsel Roy Cohn. Joseph Kennedy had a national network of contacts and became a vocal supporter, building McCarthy's popularity among Catholics and making sizable contributions to McCarthy's campaigns.[107] The Kennedy patriarch hoped that one of his sons would be president. Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice which Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.\nUnlike many Democrats, John F. Kennedy, who served in the Senate with McCarthy from 1953 until the latter's death in 1957, never attacked McCarthy. Due to his friendship with the Kennedys[108] and, reportedly, a $50,000 donation from Joseph Kennedy, McCarthy did not campaign for JFK's 1952 opponent, Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.. Lodge lost despite Eisenhower winning the state in the presidential election.[109] When a speaker at a February 1952 final club dinner stated that he was glad that McCarthy had not attended Harvard, an angry Kennedy jumped up, denounced the speaker, and left the event.[106] When Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. asked John Kennedy why he avoided criticizing McCarthy, Kennedy responded by saying, \"Hell, half my voters in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero\".[109]\nMcCarthy and Eisenhower\n[edit]During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower campaign toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In a speech delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared that while he agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were afraid that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech.[110][111] The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.[110]\nWith his victory in the 1952 presidential race, Eisenhower became the first Republican president in 20 years. The Republican Party also held a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that \"Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal. ... Leadership, he explained, meant patience and conciliation, not 'hitting people over the head.'\"[112]\nMcCarthy won reelection in 1952 with 54% of the popular vote, defeating former Wisconsin State Attorney General Thomas E. Fairchild but, as stated above, badly trailing a Republican ticket which otherwise swept the state of Wisconsin; all the other Republican winners, including Eisenhower himself, received at least 60% of the Wisconsin vote.[113] Those who expected that party loyalty would cause McCarthy to tone down his accusations of Communists being harbored within the government were soon disappointed. Eisenhower had never been an admirer of McCarthy, and their relationship became more hostile once Eisenhower was in office. In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television, McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing \"1,456 Truman holdovers who were ... gotten rid of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion.\" He then went on to complain that John Paton Davies Jr. was still \"on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower administration,\" even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier, and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to \"put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the Central Intelligence Agency.\" In the same speech, he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War.[114] By the end of 1953, McCarthy had altered the \"twenty years of treason\" catchphrase he had coined for the preceding Democratic administrations and began referring to \"twenty-one years of treason\" to include Eisenhower's first year in office.[115]\nAs McCarthy became increasingly combative towards the Eisenhower Administration, Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly. Eisenhower refused, saying privately \"nothing would please him [McCarthy] more than to get the publicity that would be generated by a public repudiation by the President.\"[116] On several occasions Eisenhower is reported to have said of McCarthy that he did not want to \"get down in the gutter with that guy.\"[117]\nSenate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations\n[edit]With the beginning of his second term as senator in January 1953, McCarthy was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations. According to some reports, Republican leaders were growing wary of McCarthy's methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the Internal Security Subcommittee—the committee normally involved with investigating Communists—thus putting McCarthy \"where he can't do any harm\", in the words of Senate Majority Leader Robert A. Taft.[118] However, the Committee on Government Operations included the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow McCarthy to use it for his own investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed Roy Cohn as chief counsel and 27-year-old Robert F. Kennedy as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee. Later, McCarthy also hired Gerard David Schine, heir to a hotel-chain fortune, on the recommendation of George Sokolsky.[119]\nThis subcommittee would be the scene of some of McCarthy's most publicized exploits. When the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under McCarthy's chairmanship were made public in 2003–04,[120] Senators Susan Collins and Carl Levin wrote the following in their preface to the documents:\nSenator McCarthy's zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings. ... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to re-occur.[121]\nThe subcommittee first investigated allegations of Communist influence in the Voice of America, at that time administered by the State Department's United States Information Agency. Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery, with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations.[122] A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence on the content of broadcasts, but none of the charges were substantiated. Morale at VOA was badly damaged, and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy's investigation. Ed Kretzman, a policy advisor for the service, would later comment that it was VOA's \"darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man, Roy Cohn, almost succeeded in muffling it.\"[122]\nThe subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency. Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves \"material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc.\" Some libraries went as far as burning the newly-forbidden books.[123] Shortly after this, in one of his public criticisms of McCarthy, President Eisenhower urged Americans: \"Don't join the book burners. ... Don't be afraid to go in your library and read every book.\"[124]\nSoon after receiving the chair to the Subcommittee on Investigations, McCarthy appointed J. B. Matthews as staff director of the subcommittee. One of the nation's foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the House Un-American Activities Committee. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled \"Reds and Our Churches\",[125][126] which opened with the sentence, \"The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen.\" A group of senators denounced this \"shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy\" and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy initially refused to do this. As the controversy mounted, however, and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews's ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this was a signal defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.[127]\nInvestigating the Army\n[edit]In autumn 1953, McCarthy's committee began its ill-fated inquiry into the United States Army. This began with McCarthy opening an investigation into the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations.[128] Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of Irving Peress, a New York dentist who had been drafted into the army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing American Labor Party, had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress's superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy's questions, citing his rights under the Fifth Amendment. McCarthy responded by sending a message to Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens, demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the army to be effected immediately, and the next day Brigadier General Ralph W. Zwicker, his commanding officer at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey, gave him an honorable separation from the army. At McCarthy's encouragement, \"Who promoted Peress?\" became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.[129]\nArmy–McCarthy hearings\n[edit]Early in 1954, the U.S. Army accused McCarthy and his chief counsel, Roy Cohn, of improperly pressuring the army to give favorable treatment to G. David Schine, a former aide to McCarthy and a friend of Cohn's, who was then serving in the army as a private.[130] McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith, in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee, and the Army–McCarthy hearings convened on April 22, 1954.[131]\nThe army consulted with an attorney familiar with McCarthy to determine the best approach to attacking him. Based on his recommendation, it decided not to pursue McCarthy on the question of communists in government: \"The attorney feels it is almost impossible to counter McCarthy effectively on the issue of kicking Communists out of Government, because he generally has some basis, no matter how slight, for his claim of Communist connection.\"[45]\nThe hearings lasted for 36 days and were broadcast on live television by ABC and DuMont, with an estimated 20 million viewers. After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Cohn had engaged in \"unduly persistent or aggressive efforts\". The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams \"made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth\", and that Adams \"made vigorous and diligent efforts\" to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board \"by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [McCarthy] committee\".[132]\nOf far greater importance to McCarthy than the committee's inconclusive final report was the adverse effect that the extensive exposure had on his popularity. Many in the audience saw him as bullying, reckless, and dishonest, and the daily newspaper summaries of the hearings were also frequently unfavorable.[133][134] Late in the hearings, Senator Stuart Symington made an angry and prophetic remark to McCarthy. Upon being told by McCarthy that \"You're not fooling anyone\", Symington replied: \"Senator, the American people have had a look at you now for six weeks; you're not fooling anyone, either.\"[135]\nIn Gallup polls of January 1954, 50% of those polled had a favorable opinion of McCarthy. In June, that number had fallen to 34%. In the same polls, those with a unfavorable opinion of McCarthy increased from 29% to 45%.[136]\nAn increasing number of Republicans and conservatives were coming to see McCarthy as a liability to the party and to anti-communism. Representative George H. Bender noted, \"There is a growing impatience with the Republican Party. McCarthyism has become a synonym for witch-hunting, Star Chamber methods, and the denial of ... civil liberties.\"[137] Frederick Woltman, a reporter with a long-standing reputation as a staunch anti-communist, wrote a five-part series of articles criticizing McCarthy in the New York World-Telegram. He stated that McCarthy \"has become a major liability to the cause of anti-communism\", and accused him of \"wild twisting of facts and near-facts [that] repels authorities in the field\".[138][139]\nThe most famous incident in the hearings was an exchange between McCarthy and the army's chief legal representative, Joseph Nye Welch. On June 9, 1954,[140] the 30th day of the hearings, Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. with McCarthy's list of 130 Communists or subversives in defense plants \"before the sun goes down\". McCarthy stepped in and said that if Welch was so concerned about persons aiding the Communist Party, he should check on a man in his Boston law office named Fred Fisher, who had once belonged to the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive lawyers' association.[141]\nIn an impassioned defense of Fisher, Welch responded, \"Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness ...\" When McCarthy resumed his attack, Welch interrupted him: \"Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator. You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, Sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?\" When McCarthy once again persisted, Welch cut him off and demanded the chairman \"call the next witness\". At that point, the gallery erupted in applause and a recess was called.[142]\nEdward R. Murrow, See It Now\n[edit]Even before McCarthy's clash with Welch in the hearings, one of the most prominent attacks on McCarthy's methods was an episode of the television documentary series See It Now, hosted by journalist Edward R. Murrow, which was broadcast on March 9, 1954. Titled \"A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy\", the episode consisted largely of clips of McCarthy speaking. In these clips, McCarthy accuses the Democratic party of \"twenty years of treason\", describes the American Civil Liberties Union as \"listed as 'a front for, and doing the work of', the Communist Party\",[143] and berates and harangues various witnesses, including General Zwicker.[144]\nIn his conclusion, Murrow said of McCarthy:\nNo one familiar with the history of this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.\nThis is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.\nThe actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it—and rather successfully. Cassius was right: \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\"[145]\nThe following week, See It Now ran another episode critical of McCarthy, this one focusing on the case of Annie Lee Moss, an African-American army clerk who was the target of one of McCarthy's investigations. The Murrow shows, together with the televised Army–McCarthy hearings of the same year, were the major causes of a nationwide popular opinion backlash against McCarthy,[146] in part because for the first time his statements were being publicly challenged by noteworthy figures. To counter the negative publicity, McCarthy appeared on See It Now on April 6, 1954, and made a number of charges against the popular Murrow, including the accusation that he colluded with VOKS, the \"Russian espionage and propaganda organization\".[147] This response did not go over well with viewers, and the result was a further decline in McCarthy's popularity.[citation needed]\n\"Joe Must Go\" recall attempt\n[edit]On March 18, 1954, Sauk-Prairie Star editor Leroy Gore of Sauk City, Wisconsin urged the recall of McCarthy in a front-page editorial that ran alongside a sample petition that readers could fill out and mail to the newspaper. A Republican and former McCarthy supporter, Gore cited the senator with subverting President Eisenhower's authority, disrespecting Wisconsin's own Gen. Ralph Wise Zwicker and ignoring the plight of Wisconsin dairy farmers faced with price-slashing surpluses.[148]\nDespite critics' claims that a recall attempt was foolhardy, the \"Joe Must Go\" movement caught fire and was backed by a diverse coalition including other Republican leaders, Democrats, businessmen, farmers and students. Wisconsin's constitution stipulates the number of signatures needed to force a recall election must exceed one-quarter the number of voters in the most recent gubernatorial election, requiring the anti-McCarthy movement to gather some 404,000 signatures in sixty days. With little support from organized labor or the state Democratic Party, the roughly organized recall effort attracted national attention, particularly during the concurrent Army-McCarthy hearings.[citation needed]\nFollowing the deadline of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent out of state to avoid a subpoena from Sauk County district attorney Harlan Kelley, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating the leaders of the recall campaign on the grounds that they had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act. Chicago newspapermen later tallied 335,000 names while another 50,000 were said to be hidden in Minneapolis, with other lists buried on Sauk County farms.[148]\nPublic opinion\n[edit]| Date | Favorable | No Opinion | Unfavorable | Net Favorable |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1952 August | 15 | 63 | 22 | −7 |\n| 1953 April | 19 | 59 | 22 | −3 |\n| 1953 June | 35 | 35 | 30 | +5 |\n| 1953 August | 34 | 24 | 42 | −8 |\n| 1954 January | 50 | 21 | 29 | +21 |\n| 1954 March | 46 | 18 | 36 | +10 |\n| 1954 April | 38 | 16 | 46 | −8 |\n| 1954 May | 35 | 16 | 49 | −14 |\n| 1954 June | 34 | 21 | 45 | −11 |\n| 1954 August | 36 | 13 | 51 | −15 |\n| 1954 November | 35 | 19 | 46 | −11 |\nCensure and the Watkins Committee\n[edit]Several members of the U.S. Senate had opposed McCarthy well before 1953. Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, was the first. She delivered her \"Declaration of Conscience\" speech on June 1, 1950, calling for an end to the use of smear tactics, without mentioning McCarthy or anyone else by name. Only six other Republican senators—Wayne Morse, Irving Ives, Charles W. Tobey, Edward John Thye, George Aiken, and Robert C. Hendrickson—agreed to join her in condemning McCarthy's tactics. McCarthy referred to Smith and her fellow senators as \"Snow White and the six dwarfs\".[150]\nOn March 9, 1954, Vermont Republican senator Ralph E. Flanders gave a humor-laced speech on the Senate floor, questioning McCarthy's tactics in fighting communism, likening McCarthyism to \"house-cleaning\" with \"much clatter and hullabaloo\". He recommended that McCarthy turn his attention to the worldwide encroachment of Communism outside North America.[151][152]\nIn a June 1 speech, Flanders compared McCarthy to Adolf Hitler, accusing him of spreading \"division and confusion\" and saying, \"Were the Junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the Communists he could not have done a better job for them.\"[153]\nOn June 11, Flanders introduced a resolution to have McCarthy removed as chair of his committees. Although there were many in the Senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted, there was no clear majority supporting this resolution. Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate's rules regarding committee chairs and seniority. Flanders next introduced a resolution to censure McCarthy. The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy's part. As Flanders put it, \"It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing,\" but rather his overall pattern of behavior. Ultimately a \"bill of particulars\" listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution. A special committee, chaired by Senator Arthur Vivian Watkins, was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution. This committee opened hearings on August 31.[154]\nAfter two months of hearings and deliberations, the Watkins Committee recommended that McCarthy be censured on two of the 46 counts: his contempt of the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration, which had called him to testify in 1951 and 1952, and his abuse of General Zwicker in 1954. The Zwicker count was dropped by the full Senate on the grounds that McCarthy's conduct was arguably \"induced\" by Zwicker's own behavior. In place of this count, a new one was drafted regarding McCarthy's statements about the Watkins Committee itself.[155]\nThe two counts on which the Senate ultimately voted were:\n- That McCarthy had \"failed to co-operate with the Sub-committee on Rules and Administration\", and \"repeatedly abused the members who were trying to carry out assigned duties ...\"\n- That McCarthy had charged \"three members of the [Watkins] Select Committee with 'deliberate deception' and 'fraud' ... that the special Senate session ... was a 'lynch party'\", and had characterized the committee \"as the 'unwitting handmaiden', 'involuntary agent' and 'attorneys in fact' of the Communist Party\", and had \"acted contrary to senatorial ethics and tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute, to obstruct the constitutional processes of the Senate, and to impair its dignity\".[156]\nOn December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to \"condemn\" McCarthy on both counts by a vote of 67 to 22.[157] The Democrats present unanimously favored condemnation and the Republicans were split evenly. The only senator not on record was John F. Kennedy, who was hospitalized for back surgery; Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted.[158] Immediately after the vote, Senator H. Styles Bridges, a McCarthy supporter, argued that the resolution was \"not a censure resolution\" because the word \"condemn\" rather than \"censure\" was used in the final draft. The word \"censure\" was then removed from the title of the resolution, though it is generally regarded and referred to as a censure of McCarthy, both by historians[159] and in Senate documents.[160] McCarthy himself said, \"I wouldn't exactly call it a vote of confidence.\" He added, \"I don't feel I've been lynched.\"[161]\nHowever, Indiana Senator William E. Jenner, one of McCarthy's friends and fellow Republicans, likened McCarthy's conduct to that of \"the kid who came to the party and peed in the lemonade.\"[162]\nFinal years\n[edit]After his condemnation and censure, McCarthy continued to perform his senatorial duties for another two and a half years. His career as a major public figure, however, had been ruined. His colleagues in the Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or received with intentional and conspicuous displays of inattention.[163]\nThe press that had once recorded his every public statement now ignored him, and outside speaking engagements dwindled almost to nothing. Eisenhower, finally freed of McCarthy's political intimidation, quipped to his Cabinet that McCarthyism was now \"McCarthywasm\".[164]\nStill, McCarthy continued to rail against communism and socialism. He warned against attendance at summit conferences with \"the Reds\", saying that \"you cannot offer friendship to tyrants and murderers ... without advancing the cause of tyranny and murder.\"[165]\nHe declared that \"co-existence with Communists is neither possible nor honorable nor desirable. Our long-term objective must be the eradication of Communism from the face of the earth.\" In one of his final acts in the Senate, McCarthy opposed President Eisenhower's nomination to the Supreme Court of William J. Brennan, after reading a speech Brennan had given shortly beforehand in which he characterized McCarthy's anti-Communist investigations as \"witch hunts\". McCarthy's opposition failed to gain any traction, however, and he was the only senator to vote against Brennan's confirmation.[166]\nMcCarthy's biographers agree that he was a changed man, for the worse, after the censure; declining both physically and emotionally, he became a \"pale ghost of his former self\", in the words of Fred J. Cook.[167]\nIt was reported that McCarthy suffered from cirrhosis of the liver and was frequently hospitalized for alcohol abuse. Numerous eyewitnesses, including Senate aide George Reedy and journalist Tom Wicker, reported finding him drunk in the Senate.\nJournalist Richard Rovere (1959) wrote:\nHe had always been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The difficulty toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink, and he did not snap back quickly.[168]\nMcCarthy had also become addicted to morphine. Harry J. Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, became aware of McCarthy's addiction in the 1950s, and demanded he stop using the drug. McCarthy refused.[169] In Anslinger's memoir, The Murderers (1961), McCarthy is anonymously quoted as saying:\nI wouldn't try to do anything about it, Commissioner ... It will be the worse for you ... and if it winds up in a public scandal and that should hurt this country, I wouldn't care […] The choice is yours.[169]\nAnslinger decided to give McCarthy access to morphine in secret from a pharmacy in Washington, D.C. The morphine was paid for by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, right up to McCarthy's death. Anslinger never publicly named McCarthy, and he threatened with prison a journalist who had uncovered the story.[169] However, McCarthy's identity was known to Anslinger's agents, and journalist Maxine Cheshire confirmed his identity with Will Oursler, co-author of The Murderers, in 1978.[169][170]\nDeath\n[edit]McCarthy died in the Bethesda Naval Hospital on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. His death certificate listed the cause of death as \"Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown\"; previously doctors had not reported him to be in critical condition. It was hinted in the press that he died of alcoholism (cirrhosis of the liver), an estimation that is now accepted by modern biographers.[15] Thomas C. Reeves argues that he effectively died by suicide.[171] He was given a state funeral that was attended by 70 senators, and a Solemn Pontifical Requiem Mass was celebrated before more than 100 priests and 2,000 others at Washington's St. Matthew's Cathedral. Thousands of people viewed his body in Washington. He was buried in St. Mary's Parish Cemetery, Appleton, Wisconsin, where more than 17,000 people filed through St. Mary's Church in order to pay him their last respects.[172] Three senators—George W. Malone, William E. Jenner, and Herman Welker—had flown from Washington to Appleton on the plane that carried McCarthy's casket. Robert F. Kennedy attended the funeral in Wisconsin. McCarthy was survived by his wife, Jean, and their daughter, Tierney.\nIn the summer of 1957, a special election was held to fill McCarthy's seat. In the primaries, voters in both parties turned away from McCarthy's legacy. The Republican primary was won by Governor Walter J. Kohler Jr., who called for a clean break from McCarthy's approach; he defeated former Representative Glenn Robert Davis, who charged that President Eisenhower was soft on Communism.[173]\nKohler was defeated in the special general election by Democrat William Proxmire.[174] After assuming his seat, Proxmire did not pay the customary tribute to his predecessor and stated instead that McCarthy was a \"disgrace to Wisconsin, to the Senate, and to America.\"[175] As of 2025, McCarthy is the last Republican to have held, or won election to, Wisconsin's Class 1 Senate seat.[176]\nLegacy\n[edit]| Part of a series on |\n| Conservatism in the United States |\n|---|\nWilliam Bennett, former Reagan Administration Secretary of Education, summed up his perspective in his 2007 book America: The Last Best Hope:\nThe cause of anti-communism, which united millions of Americans and which gained the support of Democrats, Republicans and independents, was undermined by Sen. Joe McCarthy ... McCarthy addressed a real problem: disloyal elements within the U.S. government. But his approach to this real problem was to cause untold grief to the country he claimed to love ... ¨Best¨ of all, McCarthy besmirched the honorable cause of anti-communism. He discredited legitimate efforts to counter Soviet subversion of American institutions.[177]\nHouse Un-American Activities Committee\n[edit]McCarthy's hearings are often incorrectly conflated with the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). HUAC is best known for its investigations of Alger Hiss and the Hollywood film industry, which led to the blacklisting of hundreds of actors, writers, and directors. Although the HUAC, being a House committee, had no formal connection to Senator McCarthy, it thrived in part as a result of his activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938–1975).[178]\nIn popular culture\n[edit]From the start of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a favorite subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.\nIn 1951, Ray Bradbury published \"The Fireman\", an allegory on suppression of ideas. This served as the basis for Fahrenheit 451 published in 1953.[179][180] Bradbury said that he wrote Fahrenheit 451 because of his concerns at the time (during the McCarthy era) about the threat of book burning in the United States.[181] Bob Hope was one of the first comedians to make jokes about McCarthy. During his 1952 Christmas show, Hope made a joke about Santa Claus writing to let Joe McCarthy know he was going to wear his red suit despite the Red Scare. Hope continued to offer McCarthy jokes as they were well received by most people, although he did receive some hate mail.\nIn 1953, the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features. The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.[182] In 1953, playwright Arthur Miller published The Crucible, suggesting the Salem witch trials were analogous to McCarthyism.[183]\nAs his fame grew, McCarthy increasingly became the target of ridicule and parody. He was impersonated by nightclub and radio impressionists and was satirized in Mad magazine, on The Red Skelton Show, and elsewhere. Several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954, including \"Point of Order\" by Stan Freberg and Daws Butler, \"Senator McCarthy Blues\" by Hal Block, and unionist folk singer Joe Glazer's \"Joe McCarthy's Band\", sung to the tune of \"McNamara's Band\". Also in 1954, the radio comedy team Bob and Ray parodied McCarthy with the character \"Commissioner Carstairs\" in their soap opera spoof \"Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife\". That same year, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio network broadcast a satire, The Investigator, whose title character was a clear imitation of McCarthy. A recording of the show became popular in the United States, and was reportedly played by President Eisenhower at cabinet meetings.[184] The 1953 short story Mr. Costello, Hero by Theodore Sturgeon was described by journalist Paul Williams as \"the all-time great story about Senator Joseph McCarthy, who he was and how he did what he did.\"[185]\nPost-censure reaction\n[edit]Mr. Costello, Hero was adapted by X Minus One into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956.[186] While the radio adaptation retains much of the story, it completely remakes the narrator and in fact gives him a line spoken in the original by Mr. Costello himself, thus changing the tone of the story considerably. In a 1977 interview, Sturgeon commented that it was his concerns about the ongoing McCarthy hearings that prompted him to write the story.[187]\nA more serious fictional portrayal of McCarthy played a central role in the 1959 novel The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon.[188] The character of Senator John Iselin, a demagogic anti-communist, is closely modeled on McCarthy, even to the varying numbers of Communists he asserts are employed by the federal government.[189] He remains a major character in the 1962 film version.[190]\nThe 1959 novel Advise and Consent by Allen Drury features an overzealous demagogue, Senator Fred Van Ackerman, based on McCarthy. Although the fictional senator is an ultraliberal who proposes surrender to the Soviet Union, his portrayal strongly resembles the popular perception of McCarthy's character and methods.\nMcCarthy was portrayed by Peter Boyle in the 1977 Emmy-winning television movie Tail Gunner Joe, a dramatization of McCarthy's life.[191] He was portrayed by Joe Don Baker in the 1992 HBO film Citizen Cohn.[192] Archival footage of McCarthy himself was used in the 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck about Edward R. Murrow and the See It Now episode that challenged McCarthy.[193] In the German-French docu-drama The Real American – Joe McCarthy (2012), directed by Lutz Hachmeister, McCarthy is portrayed by the British actor and comedian John Sessions.[194] In Lee Daniels' 2020 film, The United States vs. Billie Holiday, McCarthy is portrayed by actor Randy Davison.\nReconsideration\n[edit]McCarthy remains a controversial figure. Arthur Herman, popular historian and senior fellow of the Hudson Institute, says that new evidence—in the form of Venona-decrypted Soviet messages, Soviet espionage data now opened to the West, and newly released transcripts of closed hearings before McCarthy's subcommittee—has partially vindicated McCarthy by showing that some of his identifications of Communists were correct and the scale of Soviet espionage activities in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s was larger than many scholars had suspected.[195]\nIn his 2007 book Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America's Enemies, journalist M. Stanton Evans similarly argued that evidence from the Venona documents shows significant penetration by Soviet agents.[196]\nHistorian John Earl Haynes, who studied the Venona decryptions extensively, challenged Herman's efforts to rehabilitate McCarthy, arguing that McCarthy's attempts to \"make anti-communism a partisan weapon\" actually \"threatened [the post-War] anti-Communist consensus\", thereby ultimately harming anti-Communist efforts more than helping them.[197] Haynes concluded that, of the 159 people who were identified on lists used or referenced by McCarthy, evidence only substantially proved that nine of them had aided Soviet espionage efforts—while several hundred Soviet spies who were actually known based on Venona and other evidence were mostly never named by McCarthy. Haynes' own view was that a number of those accused on McCarthy's lists above, perhaps a majority, likely posed some form of possible security risk, but a significant minority of others likely did not, and several were indisputably no risk at all.[198][199]\nSee also\n[edit]- List of members of the United States Congress who died in office (1950–1999)\n- List of United States senators expelled or censured\n- McCarthyism\n- McCarthyism and antisemitism\nReferences\n[edit]Citations\n[edit]- ^\nFor a history of this period, see, for example:\nCaute, David (1978).

The Committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The Committee is unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy.Go to the footnotes for this chapter.\n- The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Soviet Government was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy\n- The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Cuban Government was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy\n- The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that anti-Castro Cuban groups, as groups, were not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved\n- The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the national syndicate of organized crime, as a group, was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved\n- The Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Central Intelligence Agency were not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy\nThe committee recognizes, of course, that while the work \"conspiracy\" technically denotes only a \"partnership in criminal purposes,\" it also, in fact, connotes widely varying meanings to many people, and its use has vastly differing societal implications depending upon the sophistication, extent and ultimate purpose of the partnership. For example, a conspiracy to assassinate a President might be a complex plot orchestrated by foreign political powers; it might be the scheme of a group of American citizens dissatisfied with particular governmental policies; it also might be the plan of two largely isolated individuals with no readily discernible motive.\nConspiracies may easily range, therefore, from those with important implications for social or governmental institutions to those with no major societal significance. As the evidence concerning the probability that President Kennedy was assassinated as a result of a \"conspiracy\" is analyzed, these various connotations of the word \"conspiracy\" and distinctions between them ought to be constantly borne in mind. Here, as elsewhere, words must be used carefully, lest people be misled.1\nA conspiracy cannot be said to have existed in Dealey Plaza unless evidence exists from which, in Justice Holmes' words, a \"partnership in criminal purposes\" may be inferred. The Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was not involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the President was, for example, largely based on its findings of the absence of evidence of significant association (2) between Oswald and other possible conspirators and no physical evidence of conspiracy.(3) The Commission reasoned, quite rightly, that in the absence of association or physical evidence, there was no conspiracy.\nEven without physical evidence of conspiracy at the scene of the assassination, there would, of course, be a conspiracy if others assisted Oswald in his efforts. Accordingly, an examination of Oswald's associates is necessary. The Warren Commission recognized that a first premise in a finding of conspiracy may be a finding of association. Because the Commission did not find any significant Oswald associ-\n1It might be suggested that because of the widely varying meanings attached to the word \"conspiracy,\" it ought to be avoided. Such a suggestion, however, raises another objection-- the search for euphemistic variations can lead to a lack of candor. There is virtue in seeing something for what it is, even if the plain truth causes discomfort.\nPage 96\nates, it was not compelled to face the difficult questions posed by such a finding. More than association is required to establish conspiracy. There must be at least knowing assistance or a manifestation of agreement to the criminal purpose by the associate.\nIt is important to realize, too, that the term \"associate\" may connote widely varying meanings to different people. A person's associate may be his next door neighbor and vacation companion, or it may be an individual he has met only once for the purpose of discussing a contract for a murder. The Warren Commission examined Oswald's past and concluded he was essentially a loner. (4) It reasoned, therefore, that since Oswald had no significant associations with persons who could have been involved with him in the assassination, there could not have been a conspiracy. (5)\nWith respect to Jack Ruby, 2 the Warren Commission similarly found no significant associations, either between Ruby and Oswald or between Ruby and others who might have been conspirators with him. (8) In particular, it found no connections between Ruby and organized crime, and it reasoned that absent such associations, there was no conspiracy to kill Oswald or the president. (9)\nThe committee conducted a three-pronged investigation of conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination. On the basis of extensive scientific analysis and an analysis of the testimony of Dealey Plaza witnesses, the committee found there was a high probability that two gunmen fired at President Kennedy.\nSecond, the committee explored Oswald's and Ruby's contact for any evidence of significant associations. Unlike the Warren Commission, it found certain of these contacts to be of investigative significance. The Commission apparently had looked for evidence of conspiratorial association. Finding none on the face of the associations it investigated, it did not go further. The committee, however, conducted a wider ranging investigation. Notwithstanding the possibility of a benign reason for contact between Oswald or Ruby and one of their associates, the committee examined the very fact of the contact to see if it contained investigative significance. Unlike the Warren Commission, the committee took a close look at the associates to determine whether conspiratorial activity in the assassination could have been possible, given what the committee could learn about the associates, and whether the apparent nature of the contact should, therefore, be examined more closely. 3\nThird, the committee examined groups-- political organizations, national governments and so on--that might have had the motive, opportunity and means to assassinate the President.\nThe committee, therefore, directly introduced the hypothesis of conspiracy and investigated it with reference to known facts to determine if it had any bearing on the assassination.\n2The Warren Commission devoted its Appendix XVI to a biography of Jack Ruby in which his family background, psychological makeup, education and business activities were considered. While the evidence was sometimes contradictory, the Commission found that Ruby grew up in Chicago, the son of Jewish immigrants; that he lived in a home disrupted by domestic strife; (6) that he was troubled psychologically as a youth and not educated beyond high school; and that descriptions of his temperament ranged from \"mild mannered\" to \"violent.\"(7) In 1963, Ruby was 52 and unmarried. He ran a Dallas nightclub but was not particularly successful in business. His acquaintances included a number of Dallas police officers who frequented his nightclub, as well as other types of people who comprised his clientele.\n3The committee found associations of both Ruby and Oswald that were unknown to the Warren Commission.\nPage 97\nThe committee examined a series of major groups or organizations that have been alleged to have been involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the President. If any of these groups or organizations, as a group, had been involved in the assassination, the conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy would have been one of major significance.\nAs will be detailed in succeeding sections of this report, the committee did not find sufficient evidence that any of these groups or organizations were involved in a conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination. Accordingly, the committee concluded, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Soviet government, the Cuban government, anti-Castro Cuban groups, and the national syndicate of organized crime were not involved in the assassination. Further, the committee found that the Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Central Intelligence Agency were not involved in the assassination.\nBased on the evidence available to it, the committee could not preclude the possibility that individual members of anti-Castro Cuban groups or the national syndicate of organized crime were involved in the assassination. There was insufficient evidence, however, to support a finding that any individual members were involved. The ramifications of a conspiracy involving such individuals would be significant, although of perhaps less import than would be the case if a group itself, the national syndicate, for example had been involved.\nThe committee recognized that a finding that two gunmen fired simultaneously at the President did not, by itself, establish that there was a conspiracy to assassinate the President. It is theoretically possible that the gunmen were acting independently, each totally unaware of the other. It was the committee's opinion, however, that such a theoretical possibility is extremely remote. The more logical and probable inference to be drawn from two gunmen firing at the same person at the same time and in the same place is that they were acting in concert, that is, as a result of a conspiracy.\nThe committee found that, to be precise and loyal to the facts it established, it, was compelled to find that President Kennedy was probably killed as a result of a conspiracy. The committee's finding that President Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy was premised on four factors:\n(1) Since the Warren Commission's and FBI's investigation into the possibility of a conspiracy was seriously flawed, their failure to develop evidence of a conspiracy could not be given independent weight.Page 98\n(2) The Warren Commission was, in fact, incorrect in concluding that Oswald and Ruby had no significant associations, and therefore its finding of no conspiracy was not reliable.\n(3) While it cannot be inferred from the significant associations of Oswald and Ruby that any of the major groups examined by the committee were involved in the assassination, a more limited conspiracy could not be ruled out.\n(4) There was a high probability that a second gunman, in fact, fired at the President. At the same time, the committee candidly stated, in expressing it finding of conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination, that it was \"unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy.\nThe photographic and other scientific evidence available to the committee was insufficient to permit the committee to answer these questions. In addition, the committee's other investigative efforts did not develop evidence from which Oswald's conspirator or conspirators could be firmly identified. It is possible, of course, that the extent of the conspiracy was so limited that it involved only Oswald and the second gunman. The committee was not able to reach such a conclusion, for it would have been based on speculation, not evidence. Aspects of the investigation did suggest that the conspiracy may have been relatively limited, but to state with precision exactly how small was not possible. Other aspects of the committee's investigation did suggest, however, that while the conspiracy may not have involved a major group, it may not have been limited to only two people. These aspects of the committee's investigation are discussed elsewhere.\nIf the conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy was limited to Oswald and a second gunman, its main societal significance may be in the realization that agencies of the U.S. Government inadequately investigated the possibility of such a conspiracy. In terms of its implications for government and society, an assassination as a consequence of a conspiracy composed solely of Oswald and a small number of persons, possibly only one, and possibly a person akin to Oswald in temperament and ideology, would not have been fundamentally different from an assassination by Oswald alone. 4\n4If the conspiracy was, in fact, limited to Oswald, the second gunman, and perhaps one or two others, the committee believes it was possible they shared Oswald's left-wing political disposition. A consistent pattern in Oswald's life (see section A 5) was a propensity for actions with political overtones. It is quite likely that an assassination conspiracy limited to Oswald and a few associates was in keeping with that pattern.\nFurther it is possible that associates of Oswald in the Kennedy assassination had been involved with him in earlier activities. Two possibilities: the attempt on the life of Gen. Edwin A. Walker in April 1963 and the distribution of Fair Play for Cuba Committee literature in August 1963. With respect to the Walker incident, there was substantial evidence that Oswald did the shooting (section A 5), although at the time of the shooting it was not sufficient to implicate Oswald or anyone else. It was not until after the Kennedy assassination that Oswald became a suspect in the Walker attack, based on the testimony of his widow Marina. Marina's characterization of Oswald is more consistent with his having shot at Walker alone than his having assistance, although at the time of the shooting there was testimony that tended to indicate more than one person was involved. Further, it is not necessary to believe all of what Marina said about the incident or to believe that Oswald told her all there was to know, since either of them might have been concealing the involvement of others.\nAccording to a general offense report of the Dallas police, Walker reported at approximately 9:10 p.m. on April 10, 1963, that a bullet had been fired through a first floor window of his home at 4011 Turtle Creek Boulevard, Dallas. Detectives subsequently found that a bullet had first shattered a window, then gone through a wall and had landed on a stack of papers in an adjoining room. In their report the detectives described the bullet as steel-jacketed, of unknown caliber.\nPolice located a 14-year-old boy in Walker's neighborhood who said that after hearing the shot, he climbed a fence and looked into an alley to the rear of Walker's home. The boy said he then saw some men speeding down the alley in a light green or light blue Ford, either a 1959 or 1960 model. He said he also saw another car, a 1958 Chevrolet, black with white down the side, in a church parking lot adjacent to Walker's house. The car door was open, and a man was bending over the back seat, as though he was placing something on the floor of the car.\nOn the night of the incident, police interviewed Robert Surrey, an aide to Walker. Surrey said that on Saturday, April 6, at about 9 p.m., he had seen two men sitting in a dark purple or brown 1963 Ford at the rear of Walker's house. Surrey also said the two men got out of the car and walked around the house. Surrey said he was suspicious and followed the car, noting that it carried no license plate.\nIf it could be shown that Oswald had associates in the attempt on General Walker, they would be likely candidates as the grassy knoll gunmen. The committee recognized, however, that this is speculation, since the existence, much less identity, of an Oswald associate in the Walker shooting was hardly established. Further, the committee failed in its effort to develop productive leads in the Walker shooting.\nWith respect to the Cuba literature incident, Oswald was photographed with two associates distributing pro-Castro pamphlets in August 1963. As a result of a fight with anti-Castro Cubans, Oswald was arrested, but his associates were not. Of the two associates, only one was identified in the Warren Commission investigation (Warren Report, p. 292). Although the second associate was clearly portrayed in photographs (see Pizzo Exhibits 453-A and 453-B. Warren Commission Report, Vol. XXI, p. 139), the Commission was unable to identify him, as was the case with the committee.\nPage 99\nTop of Page\n1. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES, ON THE BASIS OF THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO IT, THAT THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY\nGo to the footnotes for this section.\n- United States-Soviet Relations\n- The Warren Commission investigation\n- The committee's investigation\n- Summary of the evidence\nHad Oswald been enlisted by the KGB, the Soviet secret police?.Top of Page\nCould the assassination have been the result of a KGB plot?(1)\n(a) United States-Soviet relations\nTo put these concerns in context, it is necessary to look at Soviet-American relations in the 1960's. United States-Soviet relations had, in fact, been turbulent during the Kennedy Presidency. There had been major confrontations: over Berlin, where the wall had come to symbolize the barrier between the two superpowers; and over Cuba, where the emplacement of Soviet missiles had nearly started World War III. (2)\nA nuclear test-ban treaty in August 1963 seemed to signal detente, but in November, tension was building again, as the Soviets harassed, American troop movements to and from West Berlin.(3) And Cuba was as much an issue as ever. In Miami, on November 18, President Kennedy vowed the United States would not countenance the establishment of another Cuba in the Western Hemisphere.(4)\nTop of Page\n(b) The Warren Commission investigation\nThe Warren Commission considered the possibility of Soviet complicity in the assassination, but it concluded there was no evidence of it.(5) In its report, the Commission noted that the same conclusion had been reached by Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, among others.(6) Rusk testified before the Commission on June 10, 1964:\nI have seen no evidence that would indicate to me that the Soviet Union considered that it had any interest in the removal of President Kennedy ...I can't see how it could be to the interest of the Soviet Union to make any such effort.Top of Page\n(c) The committee's investigation\nThe committee, in analyzing Oswald's relationship to Russian intelligence, considered:\nStatements of both Oswald and his wife, Marina, about their life in the Soviet Union;(7)Page 100\nDocuments provided by the Soviet Government to the Warren Commission concerning Oswald's residence in the Soviet Union; (8)\nStatements by Soviet experts in the employ, current or past, of the Central Intelligence Agency;(9)\nFiles on other defectors to the Soviet Union; (10) and\nStatements by defectors from the Soviet Union to the United States. (11)\nTop of Page\n(1) Oswald in the U.S.S.R.---The committee reviewed the documents Oswald wrote about his life in the Soviet Union, including his diary and letters to his mother, Marguerite, and brother, Robert. They paralleled, to a great extent, the information in documents provided to the Warren Commission by the Soviet Government after the assassination. (13) These documents were provided to the Commission in response to its request that the Soviet Government give the Commission any \"available information concerning the activities of Lee Harvey Oswald during his residence from 1959 to 1962 in the Soviet Union, in particular, copies of any official records concerning him.\"(14)\nTwo sets of documents, totaling approximately 140 pages, were turned over to the Commission by the Soviets in November 1963 and in May 1964.(15) They were routine, official papers. None of them appeared to have come from KGB files, and there were no records of interviews of Oswald by the KGB, nor were there any surveillance reports. Unfortunately, the authenticity of the documents could not be established. The signatures of Soviet officials, for example, were illegible.(16)\nNevertheless, the Soviet documents and Oswald's own statements give this account of Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union:\nHe lived there from October 1959 to June 1962.\nHe attempted suicide on learning he would not be permitted to remain in the U.S.S.R.\nHe worked in a radio plant in Minsk.\nHe met and married Marina.\nHe was originally issued a residence visa for stateless persons and later issued a residence visa for foreigners.\nHe obtained exit visas for himself and his family before departing the Soviet Union.\nNeither the documents nor Oswald's own statements indicate that he was debriefed or put under surveillance by the KGB.\nThe committee interviewed U.S. officials who specialize in Soviet intelligence, asking them what treatment they would have expected Oswald to have received during his defection. (17) For the most part, they suspected that Oswald would have routinely been debriefed by the KGB and that many persons who came in contact with Oswald in the U.S.S.R. would have been connected with the KGB.(18)\nTop of Page\n(2) Treatment of defectors by the Soviet Government.---The committee examined the CIA and FBI files on others who had defected in the same period as Oswald and who had eventually returned to the United States.(19) The purpose was to determine the frequency of KGB contact and whether the treatment of Oswald appeared to be significantly different from the norm. The defectors studied by the committee were selected because their backgrounds and other characteristics were similar to Oswald's, on the theory that their treatment by the KGB could be expected to parallel that of Oswald, if he was not a special case, a recruited assassin, for example.\nThe examination of the defector files was inconclusive, principally because the case of nearly every defector was unique. (20) In addition, the files available on the experiences of the defectors were often not adequate to extract meaningful data for the purpose of this investiga-\nPage 101\ntion, since, they were compiled for other reasons. (21) As to contacts with the KGB, the experiences of American defectors appeared to have varied greatly. Some reported daily contact with Soviet intelligence agents, while others did not mention ever having been contacted or debriefed.(22)\n(3) Yuri Nosenko.--Of all the areas investigated by the committee with respect to possible Soviet involvement in the assassination, none seemed as potentially rewarding as an examination of statements made by KGB officers who had defected to the United States. In determining how the KGB treats American defectors, an ex-KGB officer would certainly be of great interest. In this regard, the committee had access to three such men, one of whom, Yuri Nosenko, claimed to possess far more than general information about American defectors.\nIn January 1964,5 Nosenko, identifying himself as a KGB officer, sought asylum in the United States. (23) He claimed to have worked in the KGB Second Chief Directorate whose functions, in many respects, are similar to those of the FBI.(24) According to Nosenko, while working in 1959 in a KGB department dealing with American tourists, he learned of a young American who sought to defect to the Soviet Union. The American was Lee Harvey Oswald. (25)\nNosenko stated he had worked extensively on the Oswald case, and he provided the FBI and CIA with data pertaining to Oswald's request to defect and remain in the Soviet Union, the initial rejection of that request by the KGB, Oswald's suicide attempt and a subsequent decision to permit him to remain in Russia. (26) Although the KGB, according to Nosenko, was well aware of Oswald, it made no attempt to debrief or interview him.(27) Never was any consideration given by the KGB to enlist Oswald into the Soviet intelligence service. (28)\nThe committee was most interested in Nosenko's claim that in 1963, after Oswald was arrested in the assassination, he had an opportunity to see the KGB file on the suspected assassin. As a result, Nosenko said, he was able to state categorically that Oswald was not a Soviet agent and that no officer of the KGB had ever interviewed or debriefed him. (29)\nNosenko's testimony, however, did not settle the question of Soviet complicity in the assassination. From the time of his defection, some U.S. intelligence officers suspected Nosenko was on a disinformation mission to mislead the American Government. Since other CIA officials believed Nosenko was a bona fide defector, a serious disagreement at the top level of the Agency resulted. (30)\nThe Warren Commission found itself in the middle of the Nosenko controversy--and in a quandary of its own, since the issue of Nosenko's reliability bore significantly on the assassination investigation.(31) If he was telling the truth, the Commission could possibly write off Soviet involvement in a conspiracy. 6 If, on the other hand, Nosenko was lying, the Commission would be faced with a dilemma. While a deceitful Nosenko would not necessarily point to Soviet complicity, it would leave the issue in limbo. The Warren Commission\n5Nosenko had first contacted the U.S.Government in June 1962.\n6The Commission as well as the committee recognized that Nosenko could have been candid and that the connection between Oswald and the KGB could have been compartmentalized, that is, known only to a few people, not including Nosenko.\nPage 102\nchose not to call Nosenko as a witness or to mention him in its report, apparently because it could not resolve the issue of his reliability. (32)\nThe committee, on the other hand, reviewed all available statements and files pertaining to Nosenko. (33) It questioned Nosenko in detail about Oswald, finding significant inconsistencies in statements he had given the FBI, CIA and the committee. (34) For example, Nosenko told the committee that the KGB had Oswald under extensive surveillance, including mail interception, wiretap and physical observation. Yet, in 1964, he told the CIA and FBI there had been no such surveillance of Oswald.(35) Similarly, in 1964, Nosenko indicated there had been no psychiatric examination of Oswald subsequent to his suicide attempt, while in 1978 he detailed for the committee the reports he had read about psychiatric examinations of Oswald.(36)\nThe committee also found that the CIA had literally put Nosenko in solitary confinement from 1964 to 1968. (37) Strangely, while he was interrogated during this period, he was questioned very little about Oswald. (38) The Agency did not seem to realize Nosenko's importance to an investigation of the assassination. While Richard Helms, then the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans, did tell Chief Justice Warren about Nosenko, the Agency's interest in him seemed to be largely limited to its own intelligence-gathering problem: did the KGB send Nosenko to the United States to deceive the CIA on many matters, only one of them perhaps related to the assassination? (39)\nIn the end, the committee, too, was unable to resolve the Nosenko matter. The fashion in which Nosenko was treated by the Agency--his interrogation and confinement--virtually ruined him as a valid source of information on the assassination. Nevertheless, the committee was certain Nosenko lied about Oswald--whether it was to the FBI and CIA in 1964, or to the committee in 1978, or perhaps to both.(40)\nThe reasons he would lie about Oswald range from the possibility that he merely wanted to exaggerate his own importance to the disinformation hypothesis with its sinister implications.\nLacking sufficient evidence to distinguish among alternatives, 7 the committee decided to limit its conclusion to a characterization of Nosenko as an unreliable source of information about the assassination, or, more specifically, as to whether Oswald was ever contacted, or placed under surveillance, by the KGB.\nTop of Page\n(4) Opinions of other defectors.--In addition to interviewing Nosenko, the committee questioned two other former KGB officers who had defected to the United States. While neither could base an opinion on any personal experience with that part of the KGB in which Nosenko said he had served, both said that Oswald would have been of interest to the Soviet intelligence agency, that he would have been debriefed and that he may have been kept under surveillance.(41)\nTop of Page\n(5) Marina Oswald.--The committee not only considered a possible connection between Oswald and the KGB, it also looked into charges that his widow, Marina, was an agent of the KGB, or that she at least influenced her husband's actions in the assassination on orders from\n7Beyond those reasons for falsification that can be attributed to Nosenko himself, there has been speculation that the Soviet Government, while not involved in the assassination, sent Nosenko on a mission to allay American fears. Hence, while his story about no connection between Oswald and the KGB might be false, his claim of no Soviet involvement in the assassination would be truthful.\nPage 103\nSoviet officials. The committee examined Government files on Marina, it questioned experts on Soviet affairs and former KGB officers, and it took testimony from Marina herself.(42) The committee could find no evidence to substantiate the allegations about Marina Oswald Porter.\nMrs. Porter testified before the committee that Oswald had never been contacted directly by the KGB, though she assumed that he and she alike had been under KGB surveillance when they lived in the Soviet Union.\nTop of Page\n(6) Response of the Soviet Government.--Finally, the committee attempted to obtain from the Soviet Government any information on Oswald that it had not provided to the Warren Commission. In response to a committee request relayed by the State Department, the Soviet Government informed the committee that all the information it had on Oswald had been forwarded to the Warren Commission. (43)\nThe committee concluded, however, that it is highly probable that the Soviet Government possessed information on Oswald that it has not provided to the U.S. Government. It would be the extensive information that most likely was gathered by a KGB surveillance of Oswald and Marina while they were living in Russia. It is also quite likely that the Soviet Government withheld files on a KGB interview with Oswald. 8\nTop of Page\n(d) Summary of the evidence\nIts suspicions notwithstanding, the committee was led to believe, on the basis of the available evidence, that the Soviet Government was not involved in the assassination. In the last, analysis, the Committee agreed with the testimony of former Secretary of State Dean Rusk. To wit, there is no evidence that the Soviet Government had any interest in removing President Kennedy, nor is there any evidence that it planned to take advantage of the President's death before it happened or attempted to capitalize on it after it occurred. In fact, the reaction of the Soviet Government as well as the Soviet people seemed to be one of genuine shock and sincere grief. The committee believed, therefore, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Soviet Government was not involved in the assassination.\nTop of Page\n2. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES, ON THE BASIS OF THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO IT, THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY\nGo to the footnotes for this section.\n- United States-Cuban relations\n- Earlier investigations of Cuban complicity\n- The committee's analysis of the CIA task force report\n- Cubana Airlines flight allegation\n- Gilberto Policarpo Lopez allegation\n- Other allegations\n- The committee's trip to Cuba\n- Deficiencies of the 1963-64 investigation\n- Summary of the findings\n8The committee concluded that it should not necessarily be inferred from the failure of the Soviet Government to cooperate with the committee that it was involved in the assassination. Just as agencies of the U.S. intelligence community are reluctant to share their confidential files, a similar response might be expected to come from the KGB. The Soviet Government, it could be argued, would have little to gain and much to lose by turning over its files. While the committee recognized the logic of this argument, it regretted that the Soviet Government, in the interest of historical truth, did not cooperate.\nPage 104\nnecessary to look at Cuban-American relations in the years immediately before and after President Kennedy took office.\nTop of Page\n(a) United States-Cuban relations\nThe triumphant arrival of Fidel Castro in Havana on, January 1, 1959, marking a victorious climax of file revolution he had led, was initially heralded in the United States as well as in Cuba. Castro was hailed as a champion of the people, a man who would lead a free and democratic Cuba. While some suspected that Castro had Communist leanings, the majority of the American public supported him. (2) The appointment of Philip Bonsal as U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, replacing Earl E.T. Smith, who was personally wary of Castro, was a clear signal that the United States was interested in amicable relations with the revolutionary government. On appointing Bonsal, President Eisenhower expressed the hope for an \"ever closer relationship between Cuba and the United States.\"(3)\nBy the end of 1959, however, United States-Cuban relations had deteriorated to the point that there was open hostility between the two countries. (4) President Kennedy was to inherit the problem in 1961, and by the time of his assassination on November 22, 1963, the antagonism had developed into a serious international crisis.\nTo begin with, the United States deplored the mass executions of officials of the Batista government that Castro had deposed. (5) In reply, Castro charged that the United States had never voiced objections to killing and torture by Batista. He said the trials and sentences would continue. (6) In his revolutionary economic policies. Castro took steps that severely challenged the traditional role of the United States. In March 1959, the Cuban Government took over the United States-owned Cuban Telephone Co. in May. U.S. companies were among those expropriated in the Cuban Government's first large-scale nationalization action, also in May, the agrarian reform law resulted in the expropriation of large landholdings, many of them U.S.-owned. (7)\nVice President Nixon met with Castro in Washington in April. Castro left the meeting convinced that Nixon was hostile. For his part, Nixon recommended to President Eisenhower that the United States take measures to quash the Cuban revolution. (8)\nDisillusionment with Castro also spread to significant elements of the Cuban populace. In June, the chief of the Cuban Air Force, Maj. Pedro Diaz Lanz, fled to the United States, charging there was Communist influence in the armed forces and the Government of Cuba. (9) A few weeks later, Manuel Urrutria Lleo, the President of Cuba, stated on Cuban national television that communist was not concerned with the welfare of the people and that it constituted a throat to the revolution. In the succeeding flurry of events, President Urrutria resigned after Castro accused him of \"actions bordering on treason.\"(10)\nBy the summer of 1960, Castro had seized more than $700 million in U.S. property; the Eisenhower administration had canceled the Cuban sugar quota; Castro was cementing his relations with the Soviet Union, having sent his brother Raul on a visit to Moscow, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, a top Castro lieutenant, had proclaimed publicly that the revolution was on a course set by Marx; and CIA Director Allen Dulles had said in a speech that communist had pervaded Castro's\nPage 105\nrevolution. (11) On March 17, 1960, President Eisenhower quietly authorized the CIA to organize, train, and equip Cuban refugees as a guerrilla force to overthrow Castro. (12)\nOn January 2, 1961, the United States broke diplomatic relations with Cuba.(13) A period of increased tension followed. It was marked by an exchange of bitter statements by the new U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, and the Cuban Premier. Castro charged CIA complicity in counterrevolutionary activity against his Government and publicly predicted an imminent U.S. invasion. (14) In his state of the Union address on January 30, Kennedy said:\nIn Latin America, Communist agents seeking to exploit that region's peaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba, only 90 miles from our shores. Our objection with Cuba is not over the people's drive for a better life. Our objection is to their domination by foreign and domestic tyrannies....President Kennedy said further that \"...Communist domination in this hemisphere can never be negotiated.\" (15)\nTop of Page\n(1) Bay of Pigs.--After much deliberation, President Kennedy gave the go-ahead for a landing of anti-Castro Cubans, with U.S. support, at the Bay of Pigs on the southern coast of Las Villas Province. It was launched on April 17, 1961, but it was thwarted by Cuban troops, said to have been commanded by Castro himself. (16)\nOn President Kennedy's orders, no U.S. military personnel actually fought on Cuban soil, but U.S. sponsorship of the landing was readily apparent. President Kennedy publicly acknowledged \"sole responsibility\" for the U.S. role in the abortive invasion. (17)\nAfter the Bay of Pigs debacle, the tension continued to escalate. As early as April 20, President Kennedy reaffirmed, in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, that the United States was resolved not to abandon Cuba to communism.(18) On May 1, Secretary of State Dean Rusk told the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Latin American Affairs that if the Castro regime engaged in acts of aggression, the United States would \"defend itself.\" (19) On May 17, the House of Representatives passed a resolution declaring Cuba to be \"a clear and present danger\" to the Western Hemisphere. (20) Throughout 1961 and 1962, U.S. policy was to subject Cuba to economic isolation and to support stepped-up raids by anti-Castro guerrillas, many of which were planned with the assassination of Castro and other Cuban officials as a probable consequence, if not a specific objective. (21) The Cuban Government, in turn, assumed often correctly-- that the raids were instigated and directed by the U.S. Government.(22) In preparation for another large-scale attack, the Castro regime sought and received increased military support from the Soviet Union.(23)\nTop of Page\n(2) Cuban missile crisis.--All-out war between the United States and the U.S.S.R. was narrowly averted in the Cuban missile crisis in the fall of 1962. On October 22, President Kennedy announced that U.S. photographic reconnaissance flights had discovered that work was underway in Cuba on offensive missile sites with a nuclear strike capability. (24) On October 23, the President issued a proclamation impos-\nPage 106\ning a quarantine on the delivery of offensive weapons to Cuba, to be enforced by a U.S. naval blockade. (25)\nNegotiations conducted between the United States and the Soviet Union resulted in an end to the immediate crisis on November 20, 1962.(26) To most observers, President Kennedy had won the confrontation with Castro and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.9 War had been averted, however narrowly. Russian IL-28 bombers were to be withdrawn from Cuba, and progress was being made on the removal of offensive missiles and other weapons.(27) The Soviets and the Cubans gained a \"no invasion\" pledge that was conditional upon a United Nations inspection to verify that Soviet offensive weapons had been removed from Cuba. (28) Because Castro never allowed the inspection, the United States never officially made the reciprocal pledge not to invade Cuba.(29)\nThere is evidence that by the fall of 1963, informal overtures for better United States-Cuban relations had been authorized by President Kennedy. (30) Talks between United States and Cuban officials at the United Nations were under consideration. In addition, the United States had attempted in the period after the missile crisis to stem the anti-Castro raids by, at least publicly, refusing to sanction them.(31) But covert action by the United States had neither ceased nor escaped Castro's notice, and the rhetoric indicated that the crisis could explode anew at any time. (32)\nOn September 7, 1963, in an interview with Associated Press reporter Daniel Harker, Castro warned against the United States \"aiding terrorist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders,\" and added that U.S. leaders would be in danger if they promoted any attempt to eliminate the leaders of Cuba. (33) On November 18, in Miami, Fla., just 4 days before his assassination, President Kennedy stated:\n...what now divides Cuba from my Country ...is the fact that a small band of conspirators has stripped the Cuban people of their freedom and handed over the independence and sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces beyond this hemisphere. They have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperialism, an instrument of the policy of others. a weapon in an effort dictated by external powers to subvert the other American Republics. This, and this alone, divides us. (34)Top of Page\n(b) Earlier investigations of Cuban complicity\nWhen President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, the basic outlines of the recent history of United States-Cuban relations, if not the specific details, were known to every American who even occasionally read a newspaper. Thus, when speculation arose as to the possibility of conspiracy, Fidel Castro and his Communist government were natural suspects. While rationality may have precluded any involvement of the Cuban Government, the recognition that Castro had been among the late President's most prominent enemies compelled such speculation.\n9When it became known to anti-Castro Cuban exiles that Kennedy had agreed to stop the raids on Cuba, the exiles considered the Kennedy-Khrushchev deal anything but a victory. To them, it was another betrayal (see section C 3 for details).\nPage 107\nTop of Page\n(1) The Warren Commission investigation.--Investigative efforts into the background of Lee Harvey Oswald led to an early awareness of his Communist and pro-Castro sympathies, his activities in support of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and a trip he made in September 1963 to Mexico City where he visited the Soviet Embassy and the Cuban consulate. (35)\nAll of this information had been gathered prior to the beginning of the Warren Commission's investigation, and it was sufficient to alert the Commission to the need to investigate the possibility of a conspiracy initiated or influenced by Castro. The report of the Warren Commission reflects that it was indeed considered, especially with respect to the implications of Oswald's Mexico City trip. (36) In addition, the Warren Commission reviewed various specific allegations of activity that suggested Cuban involvement, concluding, however, that there had been no such conspiracy. (37) For the next few years, suspicions of Cuban involvement in the assassination were neither widespread nor vocal. Nevertheless, beginning with a 1967 column by Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson, press reports that suggested Castro's involvement in the assassination began to circulate once again. (38) Specifically, they posed the theory that President Kennedy might have been assassinated in retaliation for CIA plots against the life of the Cuban leader.\nTop of Page\n(2) The U.S. Senate investigation.--Thereafter, the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities was formed to investigate the performance of the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies.(39) The Senate committee detailed two general types of operations that the CIA had directed against Castro. One, referred to as the AMLASH operation, involved the CIA's relationship with an important Cuban figure (code-named AMLASH) who,(40) while he was trusted by Castro, professed to the CIA that he would be willing to organize a coup against the Cuban leader. The CIA was in contact with AMLASH from March 1961 until June 1965. (41) A second plot documented by the Senate committee was a joint effort by the CIA and organized crime in America. It was initiated in 1960 in a conversation between the agency's Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Bissell, and the Director of Security, Col. Sheffield Edwards. According to the Senate committee, this operation lasted until February 1963. (42)\nThe Senate committee concluded from its review of the joint operations of the CIA and organized crime that \"...Castro probably would not have been certain that the CIA was behind the underworld attempts.\" (43) Nor, in the view of the Senate committee, would Castro have distinguished between the CIA-underworld plots and the numerous other plots by Cuban exiles which were not affiliated in any way with the CIA. (44) By emphasizing these two conclusions, the Senate committee apparently intended to suggest that the efforts by the CIA and organized crime to eliminate Castro would not have resulted any retaliation against officials of the United States.(45)\nThe Senate committee identified the AMLASH operation as being \"clearly different\" from the CIA-underworld plots.(46) It was still in progress at the time of the assassination, and it could clearly be traced to the CIA, since AMLASH's proposed coup had been endorsed\nPage 108\nby the CIA, with the realization that the assassination of Castro might be a consequence.(47) Nevertheless, the Senate committee found \"...no evidence that Fidel Castro or others in the Cuban Government plotted President Kennedy's assassination in retaliation for U.S. operations against Cuba.\"(48) The Senate committee left the door open, however, starting, \"...the investigation should continue in certain areas, and for that reason (the committee) does not reach any final conclusions.\" (49)\nTop of Page\n(3) The CIA's response to the Senate.--In response to publication of the report of the Senate committee, a special internal CIA task force was assigned in 1977 to investigate and evaluate the critical questions that had been raised. The task force first considered the retaliation thesis. It advanced the position that the Senate committee had essentially ignored the history of adversarial relations between the United States and Cuba which, if provocation were the issue, provided adequate grounds to support a theory of possible retaliation without the necessity of reaching for specific Agency programs such as the Mafia and AMLASH plots. (50) In essence, the task force report suggests, those plots were only one aspect of a large picture and in themselves were not sufficient to have provoked retaliation. (51).\nThe 1977 CIA task force then specifically responded to the Senate committee with respect to the AMLASH operation:\nWhatever the relationship with AMLASH, following the death of President Kennedy, there is every indication that during President Kennedy's life AMLASH had no basis for believing that he had CIA support for much of anything. Were he a provocateur reporting to Castro, or if he was merely careless and leaked what he knew, he had no factual basis for leaking or reporting any actual CIA plot directed against Castro. (52)With respect to the CIA-sponsored organized crime operations, the CIA task force noted:\nIt is possible that the CIA simply found itself involved in providing additional resources for independent operations that the syndicate already had underway ...[I]n a sense CIA may have been piggy-backing on the syndicate and in addition to its material contributions was also providing an aura of official sanction. (53)The task force argued, therefore, that the plots should have been seen as Mafia, not CIA, endeavors.\nA conclusion of the Senate committee had been that further investigation was warranted, based in part on its finding that the CIA had responded inadequately to the Warren Commission's request for all possible relevant information. The CIA had not told the Commission of the plots. (54) In response, the 1977 CIA task force observed:\nWhile one can understand today why the Warren Commission limited its inquiry to normal avenues of investigation, it would have served to reinforce the credibility of its effort had it taken a broader view of the matter. CIA, too, could have considered in specific terms what most saw in general terms-- the possibility of Soviet or Cuban involvement in the JFKPage 109\nassassination because of the tensions of the time ...The Agency should have taken broader initiatives, then, as well. That CIA employees at the time felt--as they obviously did-- that the activities about which they knew had no relevance to the Warren Commission inquiry does not take the place of a record of conscious review. (55)Top of Page\n(c) The committee's analysis of the CIA task force report\nThe committee believed its mandate compelled it to take a new look at the question of Cuban complicity in the assassination.\nThe Warren Commission had expressed its view, as follows:\n...the investigation of the Commission has thus produced no evidence that Oswald's trip to Mexico was in any way connected with the assassination of President Kennedy, nor has it uncovered evidence that the Cuban Government had any involvement in the assassination. (56)There are two ways that this statement may be read:\nThe Warren Commission's investigation was such that had a conspiracy existed, it would have been discovered, and since it was not, there was no conspiracy.Although the Commission inferred that the first interpretation was the proper one, the committee investigated the possibility that the second was closer to the truth.\nThe Warren Commission's investigation, limited as it was, simply did not find a conspiracy.\nSimilarly, the committee investigated to see if there was a factual basis for a finding made by the Senate Select Committee that the CIA plots to assassinate Castro could have given rise to crucial leads that could have been pursued in 1963 and 1964, or, at a minimum, would have provided critical additional impetus to the Commission's investigation. (57)\nAs previously noted, although the 1977 CIA Task Force Report at least nominally recognized that the Agency, in 1962-64, \"... could have considered in specific terms what most saw then in general terms-- the possibility of Soviet or Cuban involvement in the assassination because of the tensions of the time,\" and that the Agency \"should have taken broader initiatives then,\" the remainder of the Task Force Report failed to specify what those broader initiatives should have been or what they might have produced. It did, however, enumerate four areas for review of its 1963-64 performance:\nOswald's travel to and from the U.S.S.R.;The 1977 Task Force Report reviewed the question of Agency operations directed at Cuba, including, in particular, the Mafia and AMLASH plots.(59) In each area, the report concluded that the Agency's 1963-64 investigation was adequate and could not be faulted, even with the benefit of hindsight.(60) The task force uncritically accepted the Senate committee's conclusions where they were favor-\nOswald's Mexico visit in September-October 1963;\nThe CIA's general extraterritorial intelligence collection requirements; and\nMiscellaneous leads that the Senate committee alleged the Agency had failed to pursue. (58)\nPage 110\nable to the Agency, 10 and it critically rejected the Senate committee's conclusions (as in the case of AMLASH) wherever some possible investigative oversight was suggested. (62)\nThe 1977 Task Force Report, in sum, did little more than suggest that any theoretically \"broader initiatives\" the Agency could have taken in 1963-64 would have uncovered nothing. They would only have served to head off outside criticism. That conclusion is illustrated in the following passage of the report:\n...[our] findings are essentially negative. However, it must be recognized that CIA cannot be as confident of a cold trail in 1977 as it could have been in 1964; this apparent fact will be noted by the critics of the Agency, and by those who have found a career in the questions already asked and yet to be asked about the assassination of President Kennedy. (63)The committee, of course, realized that the CIA's 1977 review might be correct, that broader initiatives might only have been window dressing and would have produced nothing of substance. But the 1977 report failed to document that fact, if it were a fact. For example, it provided no detailed resume of the backgrounds of those CIA case officers, Cubans and Mafia figures who plotted together to kill Castro.\nThere is nothing in the report on the activities of the anti-Castro plotters during the last half of 1963. If the Agency had been truly interested in determining the possible investigative significance to the Kennedy assassination of such CIA-Cuban-Mafia associations, the committee assumed it would have directed its immediate attention to such activities in that period.\nThe task force report also noted that even without its taking broader initiatives, the CIA still sent general directives to overseas stations and cited, as an example, a cable which read:\nTragic death of President Kennedy requires all of us to look sharp for any unusual intelligence development. Although we have no reason to expect anything of a particular military nature, all hands should be on the quick alert for the next few days while the new President takes over the reins.(64)The report, reasoned that the CIA's tasking of its stations was \"necessarily general,\" since little was known at the time about which it could be specific. (65)\nThe CIA task force further noted that 4 days after this general cable was sent, a follow-up request for any available information was sent to 10 specific stations. The task force argued, in any event, that such general requirements for intelligence-gathering would have been adequate, since \"relevant information on the subject\" would have been reported anyway. (66)\nConspicuously absent from such self-exculpatory analysis was any detailed discussion of what specific efforts the Agency's stations actually made to secure \"relevant information\" about the assassination.\n10For example, with respect to the Agency's investigation of Oswald's trip to Russia, the report summarily concluded, \"Book V of the SSC Final Report, in not criticizing the Agency's performance in this aspect of the investigation, seems to have accepted it as adequate, and it will not be detailed here.\" (61)\nPage 111\nFor example, it became generally known that in 1963 the CIA had a station in Florida through which it monitored the activities of most of the anti-Castro Cuban groups operating in the United States. While the Florida station was mentioned, the task force report failed to make a comprehensive analysis of what requirements were placed on the station and the station's response. It might have been expected that the station would have been required to contact and debrief all of its Cuban sources. In addition, the station should have been asked to use all of its possible sources to determine if any operatives in the anti-Castro Cuban community had information about possible Cuban Government involvement or about any association between Oswald and possible Cuban Government agents. Further, the station, or possibly other units of the CIA, should have been tasked to attempt to reconstruct the details of the travels and activities of known pro-Castro Cuban operatives in the United States for 60 or 90 days prior to the assassination. (Such undertakings might have been made without specific cables or memoranda requiring them. The Task Force Report implied such efforts were taken by the stations \"on their own initiative.\" (67) But the Task Force Report failed to document or even discuss the details of such efforts or the responses of the stations to CIA headquarters.)\nThe committee found that the CIA's 1977 Task Force Report was little more than an attempted rebuttal of the Senate Select Committee's criticisms, and not a responsible effort to evaluate objectively its own 1963-64 investigation or its anti-Castro activities during the early 1960's or to assess their significance vis-a-vis the assassination.\nThe committee made an effort to evaluate these questions through its own independent investigation. In investigating the implications of the CIA plots and the Warren Commission's ignorance of them, the committee conducted interviews, depositions and hearings for the purpose of taking testimony from pertinent individuals, conducted interviews in Mexico and Cuba, and reviewed extensive files at the CIA and FBI. (68)\nTop of Page\n(1) AMLASH.---Turning first to the AMLASH operation, the committee received conflicting testimony as to whether, prior to the Kennedy assassination, it was considered to be an assassination plot. Former CIA Director Richard M. Helms, in his testimony before the committee, stated that the AMLASH operation was not designed to be an assassination plot. (69) And, as already indicated, the 1977 Task Force Report concluded that AMLASH had \"no factual basis for leaking or reporting any actual Central Intelligence Agency plot directed against Castro\" during President Kennedy's life.(70)\nThe committee, however, noted that such characterizations were probably both self-serving and irrelevant. The committee found that the evidence confirmed the Senate committee's report that AMLASH himself envisioned assassination as an essential first step in any overthrow of Castro. (71) It also noted that it was Castro's point of view, not the Agency's, that would have counted.\nThe CIA's files reflect that as early as August 1962, AMLASH spoke to his CIA case officer about being interested in the \"...sabotage of an oil refinery and the execution of a top ranking Castro subordinate, of the Soviet Ambassador and of Castro himself.\"(72) The case officer,\nPage 112\nin his report, while stating he made no commitments to AMLASH, acknowledged that he did tell AMLASH\"...schemes like he envisioned certainly had their place, but that a lot of coordination, planning, information-collection, et cetera, were necessary prerequisites to insure the value and success of such plans.\"(73) Further, cables between the case officer and CIA headquarters reflected that the Agency decided not to give AMLASH a \"physical elimination mission as [a] requirement,\" but that it was something \"he could or might try to carry out on his own initiative.\"(74) Thus, the CIA's relationship with AMLASH at least left him free to employ assassination in the coup he was contemplating. That relationship could also have been viewed by Castro as one involving the CIA in his planned assassination.\nUltimately, the CIA also provided AMLASH with the means of assassination and assurances that the U.S. Government would back him in the event his coup was successful.(75) CIA files reflect that AMLASH returned to Cuba shortly after the August 1962 meetings. (76) He next left Cuba and met with a CIA officer in September 1963. At that time, the CIA learned that AMLASH had not abandoned his intentions and that he now wanted to know what the U.S. \"plan of action\" was. (77) On October 11, the case officer cabled headquarters that AMLASH was determined to make the attempt on Castro with or without U.S. support.(78) On October 21, he reported that AMLASH wanted assurance that the United States would support him if his effort was successful.(79) On October 29, Desmond FitzGerald, chief of the Special Affairs Staff, met with AMLASH, representing himself as a spokesman for Attorney General Robert Kennedy. FitzGerald gave AMLASH the assurance he had asked for, (80) although the CIA has argued that the support did not specifically include assassination.\nAt the end of the meeting, according to the case officer's memorandum, AMLASH asked for \"technical support\" which, according to FitzGerald's memory, was described by AMLASH as being a high-powered rifle, or other weapon, to kill Castro. (81) Although the CIA files reflect that AMLASH did not receive the assurances of pre-assassination \"technical support\" he had asked for on October 29, the matter was further discussed, at least within the Agency, and on November 20 AMLASH was told that the meeting he \"had requested\" had been granted. (82) The technical support, as the Senate committee reported, was actually offered to AMLASH on November 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was assassinated. (83)\nWhether CIA officials chose to characterize their activity as an assassination plot, it is reasonable to infer that had Castro learned about the meetings between AMLASH and the CIA, he could also have learned of AMLASH's intentions, including the fact that his assassination would be a natural and probable consequence of the plot. In a deposition to the committee, Joseph Langosch, in 1963 the Chief of Counterintelligence for the CIA's Special Affairs Staff,(84) recalled that, as of 1962, it was highly possible that Cuban intelligence was aware of AMLASH and his association with the CIA.(85) (SAS was responsible for CIA operations against the Government of Cuba and as such was in charge of the AMLASH operation. (86))\nPage 113\nThe committee was unable to determine if that possibility was a reality. The Cuban Government informed the committee that it had come to believe that AMLASH was in fact Rolando Cubela (based upon its construction of a profile from biographic information on AMLASH made public by the Senate committee).(87) It stated it did not know of Cubela's intentions until 1966. (88) The committee was unable to confirm or deny the validity of the Cuban Government's belief that AMLASH was Cubela. Nevertheless, the committee considered the statement that, if Cubela were AMLASH, the Cuban Government did not know of his intentions until 1966. On this point, the committee was unable to accept or reject the Cuban Government's claim with confidence. The committee merely noted that the statement was corroborated by other information known about the dates of Cubela's arrest and trial in Cuba and the charges against him. The Cuban Government's position must, however, be recognized as potentially self-serving, since it must be assumed the Cuban Government would be inclined not to reveal any knowledge it may have had about AMLASH's assassination plans and the CIA prior to November 22, 1963. If it had indicated it knew, it would have contributed to the credibility of the Senate's theories about possible Cuban involvement in the assassination as a retaliatory act. (89)\nThe committee, while in Cuba, spoke to Rolando Cubela, who was serving a life sentence for acts against the Cuban Government. He confirmed the statements of the Cuban Government to the committee(90) that he did not give the Cuban Government any information that would have led it to believe that the CIA was involved in a plot on Castro's life in 1963. In considering Cubela's testimony, the committee took into account the possible influence of his confinement. After reviewing all the available evidence, the committee concluded that Castro may well have known about the AMLASH plot by November 22, 1963, and, if so, he could have either documented or assumed it was backed by the United States and that it was directed at his life. The committee believed that the details of the AMLASH operation should have been provided to the Warren Commission, since the Commission might have been able to develop leads to participants in the Kennedy assassination. At a minimum, the existence of the plot, if it had been brought to the Commissions attention, would have served as a stimulus in the 1963-64 investigation.\nIn conclusion, the committee believed a description of the activities of participants in the AMLASH plot should have been provided to the Warren Commission. It based this not only on the possibility that the plots could have increased Castro's motivation to conspire to assassinate President Kennedy (assuming he, in fact, was privy to the plot prior to November 22, 1963), but also because knowledge of the AMLASH plot might have increased the interest of the CIA, FBI, and Warren Commission in a more thorough investigation of the question of Cuban conspiracy. In stating this view, the committee did not reject the suggestion in the CIA's 1977 Task Force Report that Castro already had significant motivation to assassinate President Kennedy, even if he were not aware of the AMLASH plot. The committee noted however, that to the extent that that thesis was true, it did not negate the conclusion that the AMLASH plot was relevant\nPage 114\nand that information about it should have been supplied to the Warren Commission. If it had been made available, it might have affected the course of the investigation.\n(2) CIA-Mafia Plots.--Turning next to the CIA-Mafia plots, the committee found in its investigation that organized crime probably was active in attempts to assassinate Castro, independent of any activity it engaged in with the CIA, as the 1977 Task Force Report had suggested. (91) The committee found that during the initial stages of the joint operation, organized crime decided to assist the CIA for two reasons: CIA sponsorship would mean official sanction and logistical support for a Castro assassination; and a relationship with the CIA in the assassination of a foreign leader could be used by organized crime as leverage to prevent prosecution for unrelated offenses. (92) During the latter stages of the CIA-Mafia operation, from early 1962, to early 1963, however, organized crime may no longer have been interested in assassinating Castro. (93) The Soviet influence in Cuba had rendered the prospect of regaining the old Havana territory less likely, and there were fortunes to be made in the Bahamas and elsewhere.(94) There is reason to speculate that the Mafia continued to appear to participate in the plots just to keep the CIA interested, in hopes of preventing prosecution of organized crime figures and others involved in the plots. (95)\nThis theory is supported by the actions of Robert Maheu, an FBI agent turned private investigator who had acted as a CIA-organized crime go-between, and John Roselli, a Mafia principal in the plots. (96) Maheu, for example, was the subject of an FBI wiretap investigation in Las Vegas in the spring of 1962. He had installed a telephone wiretap, which he claimed was done as a favor to Mafia chieftain Sam Giancana, who was also involved in the anti-Castro plots.(97) Maheu's explanation to the FBI was that the tap was placed as part of a CIA effort to obtain Cuban intelligence information through organized crime contacts. The CIA corroborated Maheu's story, and the case was not prosecuted. (98) In addition, in 1966, Maheu used his contacts with the CIA to avoid testifying before a Senate committee that was conducting hearings into invasion of privacy. (99)\nAs for Roselli, the committee considered it significant that public revelations about the plots corresponded with his efforts to avoid deportation in 1966 and 1971 and to escape prosecution for illegal gambling activities in 1967.(100) It was Roselli who managed the release of information about the plots and who proposed the so-called turnaround theory of the Kennedy assassination (Cuban exiles hired by the Mafia as hit men, captured by Castro. were forced to \"turn around\" and murder President Kennedy). (101) The committee found it quite plausible that Roselli would have manipulated public perception of the facts of the plots, then tried to get the CIA to intervene in his legal problems as the price for his agreeing to make no further disclosures.\nThe allegation that President Kennedy was killed as a result of a Mafia-CIA plot that was turned around by Castro was passed to Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson by Washington attorney Edward P. Mor-\nPage 115\ngan; its ultimate source was Roselli.(102) The committee found little credibility in such an explanation for the President's death because, if for no other reason, it would have been unnecessarily risky. The committee determined from CIA files that, in 1963, the Cuban Government had agents of its own in nearly every country of the Western Hemisphere, including the United States, who undoubtedly would have been more dependable for such an assignment. Even if Castro had wanted to minimize the chance of detection by using hired non-Cuban killers, it appeared unlikely to the committee that he would have tried to force Mafia members or their Cuban exile confederates to engage in the assassination of an American head of state.\nThe committee found it more difficult to dismiss the possibility that the Mafia, while it was not turned around by Castro, might have voluntarily turned around with him. By late 1962 and 1963, when the underworld leaders involved with the CIA in the plots had perhaps lost their motivation to assassinate Castro, they had been given sufficient reason by the organized crime program of the Department of Justice to eliminate President Kennedy. The committee's investigation revealed that Mafia figures are rational, pragmatic \"businessmen\" who often realine their associations and form partnerships with ex-enemies when it is expedient.(103) While Castro, by 1963, was an old enemy of organized crime, it was more important that both Castro and the Mafia were ailing financially, chiefly as a result of pressures applied by the Kennedy administration. (104) Thus, they had a common motive that might have made an alliance more attractive than a split based on mutual animosity.\nBy 1963 also, Cuban exiles bitterly opposed to Castro were being frustrated by the Kennedy administration. (105) Many of them had come to conclude that the U.S. President was an obstacle requiring elimination even more urgently than the Cuban dictator.(106) The Mafia had been enlisted by the CIA because of its access to anti-Castro Cuban operatives both in and out of Cuba.(107) In its attempt to determine if the Mafia plot associations could have led to the assassination, the committee, therefore, recognized that Cuban antagonism toward President Kennedy did not depend on whether the Cubans were pro- or anti-Castro.\nThe committee found that the CIA-Mafia-Cuban plots had all the elements necessary for a successful assassination conspiracy--people, motive and means, and the evidence indicated that the participants might well have considered using the resources at their disposal to increase their power and alleviate their problems by assassinating the President. Nevertheless, the committee was ultimately frustrated in its attempt to determine details of those activities that might have led to the assassination--identification of participants, associations, timing of events and so on. Many of the key figures of the Castro plots had, for example, since died or, as in the case of both Giancana and Roselli, had been murdered.\nThe committee was also unable to confirm in its investigation the findings of the Senate committee and the CIA that there were reasons to discount the dangers to President Kennedy that may have resulted from CIA associations with the Mafia in anti-Castro activities, The\nPage 116\ncommittee did not agree with the Senate committee that Castro would not have blamed President Kennedy for the CIA-Mafia plots against his life. They were formulated in the United States, and the history of United States-Cuban relations shows that when Castro erred in his assumptions, it was in the direction of attributing more, not less, responsibility for attempts to depose him to U.S. Government actions than might have been merited.\nIn its 1977 Task Force Report, the CIA commented on this reality:\nThe United States provided a haven and base for Cuban exiles, who conducted their independent operations against the Castro government. Some of these exiles had the support of CIA, as well as from other elements of the U.S. Government, and still others had support from private sources. With or without official U.S. support these exiles spoke in forceful Latin terms about what they hoped to do. The Cuban intelligence services had agents in the exile community in America and it is likely that what they reported back to Havana assigned to CIA responsibility for many of the activities under consideration, whether CIA was involved or not. (108)From its investigation of documents and from the testimony of officials and others, the committee decided that the Senate committee was probably mistaken in its conclusion that the CIA-Mafia plots were less significant than the AMLASH plot. In the judgment of the committee, the CIA-Mafia plots, like the AMLASH plot, should have been aggressively explored as part of the 1963-64 investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy. At that time, it might still have been possible to determine precise dates of trips, meetings, telephone communications: and financial transactions, and the participants in these potentially pertinent transactions could have been questioned. At least in this one respect, the committee must concur with a sentiment expressed in the 1977 CIA Task Force Report:\nToday, the knowledge of the persons involved directly in the various Cuban operations in the period preceding President Kennedy's death cannot be recaptured in the form that it existed then. These persons are scattered, their memories are blurred by time, and some are dead. (109)The committee, moreover, was unable to accept the conclusion of the CIA and the Senate committee that the CIA-Mafia plots were irrelevant because they had been terminated in February 1963, several months before the assassination. The record is clear that the relationships created by the plots did not terminate, nor had the threat to Castro abated by that time. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the inherently sinister relationships had become benign by November 22, 1963.\nIn June 1963, according to the interim report of the Senate committee, Roselli had dinner with William Harvey, chief of the CIA's Cuban Task Force.(110) CIA files show that Roselli continued to maintain direct contact with Harvey at least until 1967, and he was in touch, at least indirectly, with the Agency's Chief of the Operational Support Branch. Office of Security, as late as 1971. (111) The Task Force Report itself alluded to information that, as late as June\nPage 117\n1964, gangster elements in Miami were offering $150,000 for Castro's life, an amount mentioned to the syndicate representatives by CIA case officers at an earlier date.\" (112)\nIn the absence of documentation of the activities of Mafia plot participants between February 1963 and November 22, 1963--which had not been obtained in earlier investigations, and the committee was able to do no better--the committee found it difficult to dismiss the CIA-Mafia plots, even assuming they had been terminated in February 1963, as of no consequence to the events in Dallas on November 22, 1963. The plots, in short, should have been made known to the Warren Commission. If they had been investigated in 1964, they might have provided insights into what happened in Dallas and resolved questions that have persisted.\nTop of Page\n(3) Summary of the evidence--By its conclusions about the AMLASH operation and the CIA-Mafia plots--that they were of possible consequence to the assassination investigation and therefore should have been revealed to the Warren Commission--the committee did not intend to imply it had discovered a link to the assassination. To the contrary, the committee was not able to develop evidence that President Kennedy was murdered in retaliation for U.S. activities against Castro. What the committee did determine, however, was that there was no basis, in terms of relevance to the assassination, for the CIA to decide that the AMLASH operation and the CIA-Mafia plots were of no significance to the Warren Commission's investigation. On the other hand, the possibility that President Kennedy was assassinated in retaliation for anti-Castro activities of the CIA should have been considered quite pertinent, especially in light of specific allegations of conspiracy possibly involving supporters of the Cuban leader.\nTop of Page\n(d) Cubana Airlines flight allegation\nThe committee considered specific allegations of conspiracy involving supporters of Castro.\nOne such charge, referred to in book V of the Senate select committee's report, concerns a Cubana Airlines flight from Mexico City to Havana on the evening of November 23, 1963. (113) It had been alleged that the flight was delayed 5 hours, awaiting the arrival at 9:30 p.m. of a private twin-engined aircraft.(114) The aircraft was supposed to have deposited an unidentified passenger who boarded the Cubans flight without clearing customs and traveled to Havana in the pilot's cabin. (115)\nThe Senate committee reported that the Cubana flight departed at 10 p.m. This committee checked the times of key events that night by reviewing extensive investigative agency documents. It found the following facts:\nThe Cubana flight was on the ground in Mexico City for a total of only about 4 hours and 10 minutes and thus could not have been delayed five hours. (116) The Cubana flight had departed for Havana at 8:30 p.m., about an hour before the arrival of the private aircraft reportedly carrying a mysterious passenger, so he could not have taken the flight. (117)Page 118\nThe committee found that extensive records of flight arrivals and departures at the Mexico City airport were available and deemed it doubtful that the alleged transfer of a passenger from a private aircraft to the Cubana flight could have gone unnoticed, had it occurred. (118) The committee concluded, therefore, that the transfer did not occur.\nTop of Page\n(e) Gilberto Policarpo Lopez allegation\nMore troubling to the committee was another specific allegation discussed by the Senate committee. It concerned a Cuban-American named Gilberto Policarpo Lopez.(119) According to the account, Lopez obtained a tourist card in Tampa, Fla., on November 20, 1963, entered Mexico at Nuevo Laredo on November 23, and flew from Mexico City to Havana on November 27. (12O) Further, Lopez was alleged to have attended a meeting of the Tampa chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee on November 17, 1963, and at a December meeting of the chapter, Lopez was reported to be in Cuba. (12l)\nThe committee first examined the CIA files on Policarpo Lopez.(122) They reflect that in early December 1963, CIA headquarters received a classified message stating that a source had requested \"urgent traces on U.S. citizen Gilberto P. Lopez.\" (123) According to the source, Lopez had arrived in Mexico on November 23 enroute to Havana and had disappeared with no record of his trip to Havana. The message added that Lopez had obtained tourist card No. 24553 in Tampa on November 20, that he had left Mexico for Havana November 27 on Cubana Airlines, and that his U.S. passport number was 310162.(124)\nIn another classified message of the same date, it was reported that the FBI had been advised that Lopez entered Mexico on November 27 at Nuevo Laredo. (125)\nTwo days later these details were added: Lopez had crossed the border at Laredo, Tex., on November 23; registered at the Roosevelt Hotel in Mexico City on November 25; and departed Mexico on November 27 on a Cubana flight for Havana. (126) Another dispatch noted that Lopez was the only passenger on Cubans flight 465 on November 27 to Havana. (127) It said he used a U.S. passport and Cuban courtesy visa. It noted, too: \"Source states the timing and circumstances surrounding subject's travel through Mexico and departure for Havana are suspicious.\" It was this dispatch that alerted headquarters to the source's \"urgent\" request for all available data on Lopez. (128)\nThe same day as the dispatch, headquarters sent a cable identifying the Cuban-American as Gilberto Policarpo Lopez, born January 26, 1940. It added that Lopez was not identical with a Gilberto Lopez who had been active in pro-Castro groups in Los Angeles. (129)\nHeadquarters was also told that there existed a \"good\" photograph of Lopez, showing him wearing dark .glasses. A copy of the photograph with \"27 November 1963\" stamped on the back was found in his CIA file by committee investigators in 1978. (130)\nIn March 1964, CIA headquarters received a classified message: a source had reported in late February that an American citizen named\nPage 119\nGilberto Lopes 11 had been involved in the Kennedy assassination; that Lopes had entered Mexico on foot from Laredo, Tex., on November 13 carrying U.S. passport 319962, which had been issued July 13, 1960; that he had been issued Mexican travel form B24553 in Nuevo Laredo; that Lopes had proceeded by bus to Mexico City \"where he entered the Cuban Embassy\"; and that he left the Cuban Embassy on November 27 and was the only passenger on flight 465 for Cuba. (132)\nThe following day, a classified message was sent to headquarters stating that the information \"jibes fully with that provided station by [source] in early December 1963.\" (133)\nA file had been opened on Lopez at headquarters on December 16, 1963. (134) It contained a \"Review of [material omitted] file on U.S. Citizen\" by an operations officer of the responsible component of the agency. In the review, the file was classified as a \"counterintelligence case, (that is, involving a foreign intelligence or security service).\" The date of entry of that category in the agency's records is indicated as January 22, 1975. (135)\nThe committee also reviewed an FBI investigation of Gilberto Policarpo Lopez in Key West, Fla., contained in a report dated August 1964.(136)\nIn an interview, Lopez' cousin, Guillermo Serpa Rodriguez, had said that Lopez had come to the United States soon after Castro came to power, stayed about a year and returned to Cuba because he was homesick. He returned to the United States in 1960 or 1961 fearing he would be drafted into the Cuban militia. (137)\nThe FBI also interviewed an American woman Lopez had married in Key West. She listed companies where he had been employed, including a construction firm in Tampa. She also said he began suffering from epileptic attacks, was confined for a time at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami in early 1963, and was treated by doctors in Coral Gables and Key West. She said she believed the epilepsy was brought on by concern for his family in Cuba. (138)\nLopez' wife said she received a letter from him in about November 1963, saying he had returned to Cuba once more. She said she had been surprised, although he had mentioned returning, to Cuba before he left for Tampa in November 1963. In a later letter, Lopez told his wife he had received financial assistance for his trip to Cuba from an organization in Tampa. His wife explained that he would not have been able to pay for the trip without help. She said, however, he had not had earlier contacts with Cuban refugee organizations. (139)\n11The committee noted the discrepancies in this message, as follows: the spelling of Lopes, for Lopez; the November 13 date and passport number 319962, issued July 13, 1960; and Lopez entering Mexico on foot. In its 1977 Task Force Report, the CIA cited the several \"inaccuracies,\" as they had been repeated in the report of the Senate Select Committee, as reason to refute the report itself. The TFR pointed out that Lopez' name had been misspelled \"Lopes,\" that it had Lopez entering Mexico on foot, when the CIA had information that he had traveled by automobile; that it listed incorrect digits for Lopez' passport number; that it stated that Lopez' Mexican tourist visa had been issued in Nuevo Laredo, not Tampa; and it reported that he had stayed at the Cuban Embassy. Based on these inaccuracies, the TFR concluded, \"the source was patently and extensively misinformed.\" The TFR therefore discounted the March cable that held that the information \"jibed\" with what the CIA's source had earlier reported. (131)\nThe discrepancies pointed out in the TFR were apparently intended to explain why the CIA had not taken more aggressive investigative steps to determine whether there had been a connection between Lopez and the assassination.\nPage 120\nRodriguez said Lopez left Key West in late 1963 for Tampa with the hope of being able to return to Cuba, explaining he was afraid he would be drafted into the U.S. military. Rodriguez said Lopez had not been involved in pro-Castro activity in Key West, but that he was definitely pro-Castro, and he had once gotten into a fistfight over his Castro sympathies. (140)\nThe FBI had previously documented that Lopez had actually been in contact with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and had attended a meeting in Tampa on November 20, 1963. In a March 1964 report, it recounted that at a November 17 meeting of the Tampa FPCC, Lopez had said he had not been granted permission to return to Cuba but that he was awaiting a phone call about his return to his homeland.\nIn that March report, a Tampa FPCC member was quoted as saying she called a friend in Cuba on December 8, 1963, and was told that Lopez had arrived safely. She also said that the Tampa chapter of the FPCC had given Lopez about $190 for the trip to Cuba and that he had gone to Cuba by way of Mexico because he did not have a passport. (141)\nThe March 1964 FBI report stated that Lopez did have a U.S. passport-- it had been issued in January 1960 and was numbered 310162. His Mexican tourist card was numbered M8-24553 and was issued November 20, 1963 in Tampa. The report also confirmed that Lopez entered Mexico via Laredo, Tex., by automobile on November 23, and he departed for Havana on November 27, the only passenger on a Cubana flight. He was carrying a Cuban courtesy visa.(142)\nLopez' FBI file contained a memorandum from the Tampa office. Dated October 26, 1964, it read:\nIt is felt that information developed regarding the subject is not sufficient to merit consideration for the Security Index. (143)The only information transmitted by the FBI to the Warren Commission, the committee determined, concerned a passport check on Lopez. Information sent to the Commission by the FBI on the Tampa chapter of the FPCC did not contain information on Lopez' activities. The CIA apparently did not provide any information to the Warren Commission on Lopez. (144) The committee concurred with the Senate Select Committee that this omission was egregious, since sources had reported within a few days of the assassination that the circumstances surrounding Lopez' travel to Cuba seemed \"suspicious.\" Moreover, in March 1964, when the Warren Commission's investigation was in its most active stage, there were reports circulating that Lopez had been involved in the assassination.\nIn its 1977 Task Force Report, the CIA responded to the charges of the Senate committee. It claimed that the agency had carried its investigation of Lopez as far as it could, having questioned a Cuban defector about him. (145) The committee found that the absence of access to additional sources of information was not an adequate explanation for the agency's failure to consider more seriously the suspicions of its sources or to report what information it did have to the Warren Commission. Attempts in the Task Force Report to denigrate the information that was provided on Lopez were not an adequate substitute for enabling the Warren Commission itself to pursue the leads more aggressively.\nPage 121\nFrom the information gathered by the FBI, there appeared to be plausible reasons both for Lopez' desire to return to Cuba and for his solicitation of financial aid from the Tampa FPCC chapter. Lopez' contacts in Florida appeared to have been innocent and not connected with the assassination, and while there was a suggestion in the Senate committee's report that Lee Harvey Oswald also was in contact with the Tampa FPCC chapter, the committee could find no evidence of it. Nor could the committee find any evidence that Oswald was in contact with Lopez.\nLopez' association with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, however, coupled with the facts that the dates of his travel to Mexico via Texas coincide with the assassination, plus the reports in Mexico that Lopez' activities were \"suspicious,\" all amount to a troublesome circumstance that the committee was unable to resolve with confidence.\nTop of Page\n(f) Other allegations\nThe committee also pursued allegations of Cuban complicity that were not suggested by the investigation of the Senate committee. For example, it looked into an allegation by one Autulio Ramirez Ortiz, who hijacked an aircraft to Cuba in 1961. Ramirez claimed that while being held by the Cuban Government, he worked in an intelligence facility where he found a dossier on Lee Harvey Oswald. (146) It was labeled the \"Oswald-Kennedy\" file and contained a photograph of \"Kennedy's future assassin.\"(147) In the Spanish language manuscript of a book he wrote Ramirez claimed the Oswald file read, in part \"... The KGB has recommended this individual ...He is a North American, married to an agent of the Soviet organism who has orders to go and reside in the United States. Oswald is an adventurer. Our Embassy in Mexico has orders to get in contact with him. Be very careful.\"(148)\nThe committee, in executive session, questioned Ramirez, who had been returned to the United States to serve a 20-year Federal sentence for hijacking.(149) He testified he was unable to describe the photograph he had allegedly seen and that the writing in the file was in Russian, a language he does not speak. (150)\nThe committee sought from the FBI and CIA independent evidence of the accuracy of Ramirez' allegations, but there was no corroboration of the existence of an \"Osvaldo-Kennedy\" file to be found. On the other hand, in every instance where there was independent evidence of allegations made by Ramirez (the identities of Cuban officials named by him, for example) Ramirez' statements were found to be accurate.(151)\nIn the end, however, the committee was forced to dismiss Ramirez' story about the \"Osvaldo-Kennedy\" file. The decisive factor was the committee's belief that the Cuban intelligence system in the 1961-63 period was too sophisticated to have been infiltrated by Ramirez in the manner he had described. While some details of his story could be corroborated, the essential aspects of his allegation were incredible.\nThe committee also considered the allegation that appeared in an article in a 1967 issue of the National Enquirer, written by a British freelancer named Comer Clark.(152) Purportedly based on an exclusive interview with Castro, it quoted the Cuban President as admitting to having heard of threats by Oswald to assassinate president\nPage 122\nKennedy. According to Clark, Castro told him that while at the Cuban consulate in Mexico City in September 1963, Oswald vowed he would kill the President. (153)\nOn a trip to Havana in April 1978, the committee met with President Castro and asked him about the charge. Castro denied there had ever been an interview with Clark.(154) He also suggested that had such a threat been overheard by Cuban officials, they and he would have been morally obligated to transmit it to U.S. authorities.(155)\nThe committee did not agree that the Cuban Government would have been obligated to report the threat. Nothing in the evidence indicated that the threat should have been taken seriously, if it had occurred, since Oswald had behaved in an argumentative and obnoxious fashion during his visit to the consulate. (156) Cuban officials would have been justified, the committee reasoned, to have considered the threat an idle boast, deserving no serious attention.\nThe accuracy of Clark's account was also undermined by the committee's investigation of his background. Clark had been the author of articles with such sensational titles as \"British Girls as Nazi Sex Slaves,\" \"I Was Hitler's Secret Love\" and \"German Plans to Kidnap the Royal Family.\" The committee was unable to question Clark himself, as he had since died. (157)\nDespite the committee's doubts about the Clark interview with Castro, it was informed that the substance of it had been independently reported to the U.S. Government. A highly confidential but reliable source reported that Oswald had indeed vowed in the presence of Cuban consulate officials to assassinate the President. (158)\nThis information prompted the committee to pursue the report further in file reviews and interviews. The files that were reviewed included records of conversations of relevant people at appropriate times and places. Only one of them provided any possible corroboration. It was the record of a reported conversation by an employee of the Cuban Embassy named Luisa Calderon. (159) The absence of other corroboration must be considered significant.\nA blind memorandum 12 provided by the CIA to the committee contained Calderon's pertinent remarks:\n1. A reliable source reported that on November 22, 1963, several hours after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Luisa Calderon Carralero, a Cuban employee of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, and believed to be a member of the Cuban Directorate General of Intelligence (DGI), discussed news of the assassination with an acquaintance. Initially, when asked if she had heard the latest news, Calderon replied, in what appeared to be a joking manner, \"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy.\"12there is no indication on a blind memorandum of either origin or destination.\n2. After further discussion of the news accounts about the assassination, the acquaintance asked Calderon what else she had learned. Calderon replied that they [assumed to refer to personnel of the Cuban Embassy] learned about it a little while ago. (160)\nPage 123\nLuisa Calderon's statements on the day of the assassination could be construed as either an indication of foreknowledge or mere braggadocio. The preponderance of the evidence led the committee to find that it was braggadocio. While the committee attempted to interview Calderon in Cuba, it was unable to, since she was ill. (161) Nevertheless, it forwarded interrogatories to her, which she responded to denying foreknowledge of the assassination.(162) The committee also interviewed other employees of the Cuban consulate in Mexico City in 1963 all of whom denied the allegation.(163) While it may be argued that they had a reason to do so because of Castro's view that the Cuban Government would have had a moral obligation to report the threat had it occurred, these officials, in the committee's judgment, indicated by their demeanor that they were testifying truthfully.\nThe committee also made a judgment about the risk that would have been incurred by Cubans had they testified falsely on this issue or by those who might have orchestrated their false testimony. Based on newspaper reporting alone, the Cuban Government might reasonably have believed that the committee had access to extensive information about conversations in the Cuban consulate in Mexico City and that such information might have provided convincing evidence of a coverup. To have been caught in a lie in public testimony in the United States 13 would have been a major embarrassment for the Cuban Government, one that might have implied more than moral responsibility for failing to report a threat against President Kennedy in advance of the assassination.\nOn balance, the committee did not believe that Oswald voiced a threat to Cuban officials. However reliable the confidential source may be, the committee found it to be in error in this instance.\nThe committee investigated other aspects of Oswald's trip to Mexico City in September 1963 to see if it could develop information that bore on the question of a Cuban conspiracy. It considered the claim by the Cuban consul in Mexico City in 1963, Eusebio Azcue, that a man posing as Oswald applied for a Cuban visa. 14 It also investigated two plausible, though unsubstantiated, allegations of activities that had not previously been publicly revealed:\nThat of a Mexican author, Elena Garro de Paz, who claimed that Oswald and two companions had attended a \"twist\" party at the home of Ruben Duran, brother-in-law of Silvia Duran, the secretary of Cuban consul Azcue who dealt with Oswald when he applied at the consulate for a Cuban visa.(164)The committee conducted extensive interviews with respect to these allegations. (166)\nThat of a Mexican named Oscar Contreras who, in 1967, claimed he had met Oswald on the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. (165)\nThe significance of the Elena Garro allegation, aside from its pointing to Oswald associations in Mexico City that the Warren Commis-\n13In addition to a tape-recorded interview with President Castro in Havana, the committee heard testimony in public hearing from two former Cuban counsuls in Mexico City, Eusebio Azcue and Alfredo Mirabel, and it tape-recorded an interview with Silvia Duran, a secretary at the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City in 1963 who had had one or more encounters with Oswald.\n14Details of the issue of an alleged Oswald imposter are presented in section I D 4.\nPage 124\nsion did not investigate, lay in her description of one of the companions as gaunt and blond-haired. (167) These are characteristics that both Azcue and Silvia Duran attributed to the visitor to the Cuban consulate who identified himself as Lee Harvey Oswald. (168) Even though \"gaunt and blond-haired\" did not describe Oswald, Duran said that the American visitor was the man later arrested in the assassination of the President. (169) Azcue, on the other hand, insisted that the visitor was not the individual whose published photograph was that of Oswald. (170)\nThe committee was unable to obtain corroboration for the Elena Garro allegation, although Silvia Duran did confirm that there was a \"twist\" party at her brother-in-law's home in the fall of 1963 and that Elena Garro was there. (171) She denied, however, that Oswald was there, insisting that she never saw Oswald outside of the Cuban consulate.(172) The committee was unable to check the story with official U.S. investigative agencies because they failed to pursue it, even though they were aware of it in 1964.15\nThe committee's investigation was sufficient, however, to develop a conclusion that the Elena Garro allegation had warranted investigation when it was first received by the CIA in October 1964. Even in the late 1960's, at a time when Garro and others were available for questioning, there was still the potential for sufficient corroboration 16 to make the allegation worth pursuing. Further, while the allegation did not specifically show a Cuban conspiracy, it did indicate significant Oswald associations that were not known to the Warren Commission.\nThe other Oswald association in Mexico City that might have proven significant, had it been pursued, was the one alleged by Oscar Contreras, a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The committee made an effort to investigate this allegation. Silvia Duran, for example, admitted to the committee. that she had advised Oswald he might obtain a Cuban visa if he could get a letter of recommendation from a Mexican in good standing with the Cuban revolutionary hierarchy. (175) The committee also learned that the chairman of the philosophy department at the National Autonomous University, Ricardo Guerra, held seminars from time to time at the Duran home on Kant, Hegel, and Marx. (176) The committee speculated that these circumstances might explain why Oswald contacted Contreras, who reported to Mexican authorities that Oswald approached him in Sept-\n15The committee's investigation in Mexico City was further inhibited by the refusal of the CIA to make available its sources on the Elena Garro allegation, and, as a committee of the U.S. Congress in a foreign country, it was bound by a decision of the Mexican Government to permit its citizens to decide individually if they wished to meet with committee representatives (173)\nThe CIA, moreover, had failed to pursue the Elena Garro allegation adequately in 1964. A review of the CIA file indicated that the allegation was treated skeptically because Agency officials apparently considered Elena Garro to be other than totally rational. Inquiries of sources were ordered, but the files do not indicate that any responses were actively solicited or, in fact, received. The Agency files on this aspect of the case are devoid of any substance that would suggest an active CIA investigation.\nThe committee did ultimately locate Elena Garro in Europe, but attempts by telephone to persuade her to come to the United States to testify did not succeed (174).\n16Elena Garro maintained that after the assassination she wanted to report her story to authorities but that she was warned of possible danger by a man named Manuel Calvillo. Elena Garro, alleged that Calvillo placed her in the Hotel Vermont in Mexico City where she remained for several days. In 1967, the CIA did in fact receive confirmation of Elena Garro's stay at the Hotel Vermont immediately after the assassination.\nPage 125\ntember 1963 following a roundtable discussion at the school of philosophy. 17\nThe committee's attempts to contact Contreras were frustrated. On two occasions, the Mexican Government said he would be available for an interview, but neither materialized. The committee also was unable to contract Guerra. who in 1978 was Mexico's Ambassador to East Germany. (177) The significance of the Contreras allegation, therefore, remains largely indeterminate.\nThe committee also pondered what deductions might be drawn from Azcue's conviction that the man who applied for a Cuban visa was not Oswald. One possibility considered, although ultimately rejected by the committee, was that there was a sinister association between Oswald and the Castro regime that Azcue was attempting to conceal.\nThe committee weighed the evidence on both sides of the Oswald-at-the-Cuban-consulate issue:\nThat it was Oswald was indicated by the testimony of Silvia Duran and Alfredo Mirabal, who was in the process of succeeding Azcue as Cuban consul when the visit occurred in late September 1963. They both identified Oswald from post-assassination photographs as the man who applied for a Cuban visa.The committee also sought to understand the significance of a Secret Service investigation of threats against President Kennedy by pro-Castro Cubans. In April 1961, for example, when the President and Mrs. Kennedy were scheduled to address a special meeting of the Council of the Organization of American States, the State Department reported that Cuba would be represented by one Quentin Pino Machado. Machado, a Cuban diplomat, described as a character of ill repute, armed and dangerous, ultimately did not attend the meeting. (179)\nThat it was not Oswald was a possibility raised by the committee's inability to secure a photograph of him entering or leaving the Soviet Embassy or the Cuban consulate. The committee obtained evidence from the Cuban Government that such photographs were being taken routinely in 1963. Further, the committee found that Oswald paid at least five visits to the Soviet Embassy or the Cuban consulate. 18(178)\nOn November 27, 1963, a Miami Secret Service informant told Special Agent Ernest Aragon that if the assassination involved an international plot in which Castro had participated, then Castro's agent in the plot would have been Machado, a well-known terrorist. There were\n17The Contreras story, as in the case of the Elena Garro allegation, was not adequately pursued when it first came to the attention of the CIA in 1967. At that time, the Agency was informed by the U.S. Consul in Tampico, Mexico, that Contreras had passed the information to him. An Agency employee later discussed the matter in more detail with the Consul and then met with Contreras himself. The CIA confirmed that Contreras had been a student in 1963 and was politically a strong supporter of Fidel Castro. The Contreras story was considered, according to Agency files, to be the first significant development in the investigation of the Kennedy assassination after 1965. Nevertheless, no attempt was made to determine who Contreras' associates were or how Oswald might have contacted him. Instead, the case was simply reported to the FBI. According to FBI files, no follow-up investigation was conducted.\n18The committee believed that photographs of Oswald might have been taken and subsequently lost or destroyed. The committee did obtain a photograph of a man whose description seemed to match that given by Azcue and Duran of the \"gaunt and blond-haired\" visitor to the Cuban consulate. They each stated, however, that he was not the man they had described as the one who, in the name of Lee Harvey Oswald, had applied for a visa to Cuba.\nPage 126\nrumors in the Miami Cuban community at the time that Machado had been assigned to escort Oswald from Texas to Cuba after the assassination. The plan went awry, the report continued, because Oswald had not been wearing clothing of a prearranged color and because of the shooting of Dallas Patrolman J.D. Tippit.(180)\nThe reports on Machado, along with other suspicions of Castro complicity in the assassination, were forwarded only in brief summary form by the Secret Service to the Warren Commission. The committee could find no record of follow-up action. (181) The committee's investigation of actions by the Secret Service subsequent to the assassination, however, revealed the most extensive work of the Agency to have been in response to reports of pro-Castro Cuban involvement. (182)\nTop of Page\n(g) The committee's trip to Cuba\nThe committee took its investigation to Cuba in the spring and summer of 1978. It sought information on numerous allegations, such as those mentioned above, and it put to President Castro the question of Cuban involvement in the assassination. The committee found the Cuban Government to be cooperative, both in supplying written reports and documents in response to questions and by making a number of its citizens available for interviews. (183) While the committee was unable to interview Luisa Calderon personally, the Cuban Government did permit its former consuls in Mexico City, Eusebio Azcue and Alfredo Mirabal, to come to Washington to testify in a public hearing of the committee. (184)\nIn response to the question of Cuban complicity in the assassination, Castro replied:\nThat [the Cuban Government might have been involved in the President's death] was insane. From the ideological point of view it was insane. And from the political point of view, it was a tremendous insanity. I am going to tell you here that nobody, nobody ever had the idea of such things. What would it do? We just tried to defend our folks here, within our territory. Anyone who subscribed to that idea would have been judged insane ...absolutely sick. Never, in 20 years of revolution, I never heard anyone suggest nor even speculate about a measure of that sort, because who could think of the idea of organizing the death of the President of the United States. That would have been the most perfect pretext for the United States to invade our country. which is what I have tried to prevent for all these years, in every possible sense. Since the United States is much more powerful than we are, what could we gain from a war with the United States? The United States would lose nothing. The destruction would have been here. (185)Castro added:\nI want to tell you that the death of the leader does not change the system. It has never done that. (186)In the interview, Castro also commented on his speech of September 7, 1963, which on its face might have been viewed as an indication\nPage 127\nthat Castro may have been prompted to retaliate for a CIA-inspired attempt on his life:\nSo, I said something like those plots start to set a very bad precedent, a very serious one--that could become a boomerang against the authors of those actions ...but I did not mean to threaten by that. I did not mean even that ...not in the least ...but rather, like a warning that we knew; that we had news about it; and that to set those precedents of plotting the assassination of leaders of other countries would be a very bad precedent ...something very negative. And, if at present, the same would happen under the same circumstances, I would have no doubt in saying the same as I said [then] because I didn't mean a threat by that. I didn't say it as a threat. I did not mean by that that we were going to take measures--similar measures-- like a retaliation for that. We never meant that because we knew that there were plots. For 3 years, we had known there were plots against us. So the conversation came about very casually, you know; but I would say that all these plots or attempts were part of the everyday life.(187)Finally, President Castro noted that although relations between the United States and Cuba were strained during the Kennedy administration, by 1963 there were definite hopes for reconciliation. (188)\nThe committee confirmed from the historic record that, in 1963, the Cuban Government made several overtures. While, for the most part, Kennedy did not respond favorably, he did, in November, direct that the possibility of holding talks be explored by United Nations Delegate William Atwood with Cuban United Nations Ambassador Carlos Lechuga. (189) There was also reason to believe that French journalist Jean Daniel was asked by Kennedy to relay a peace message to Castro.(190) At least, that was how Castro interpreted it when he met with Daniel on November 20, 1963. (191)\nIn his interview with the committee, Castro referred to these two developments toward rapprochement, as he viewed them, suggesting that he would not have had a motive to eliminate President Kennedy. Instead, it would have been to his advantage, Castro insisted, to have pursued the prospect for better relations that had been portended. (192)\nTop of Page\n(h) Deficiencies of the 1963-64 investigation\nIn attempting to resolve the question of possible Cuban conspiracy, the committee concluded that a definitive answer had to come, if at all, largely from the investigation conducted in 1963-64 by the Warren Commission and the FBI and CIA. What the committee was able to do 15 years later could fill in important details, but it could not make up for basic insufficiencies. Unfortunately, the committee found that there were in fact significant deficiencies in the earlier investigation. The Warren Commission knew far less than it professed to know about Oswald's trip to Mexico and his possible association with pro-Castro agents in Mexico and elsewhere. This was true, in part, because the Commission had demanded less of the FBI and CIA than called for in its mandate. (193)\nPage 128\nFor its part, the FBI mechanically ran out thousands of leads, but it failed to make effective use of its Cuban Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division or to develop and systematically pursue investigative hypotheses of possible Cuban complicity. It must be said that the FBI generally exhausted its resources in confirming the case against Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone assassin, a case that Director J. Edgar Hoover, at least, seemed determined to make within 24 hours of the assassination. (194)\nWith respect to the CIA, the committee determined that it could have been better equipped to investigate the question of Cuban complicity. 19 The CIA had, at the time, only limited access to Cuban intelligence defectors, and most of its information sources inside Cuba were better equipped to report on economic developments and troop movements than on political decisions, especially sensitive ones, such as those involving political assassination.(198)\nAs the CIA admitted in its 1977 Task Force Report, it could have taken \"broader initiatives\" in pursuing the investigation. The committee found that such initiatives could have included more comprehensive instructions on debriefing Cuban sources and more explicit tasking of stations for specific investigative efforts.\nWith respect to the CIA's investigation of possible Cuban complicity, however, the committee found that the Agency's shortcomings were not attributable to any improper motive. The committee found that the CIA did generally gather and analyze the information that came to its attention regarding possible Cuban involvement, at least until the Warren Commission made its report in 1964. Indeed, the committee noted that the Agency acted not only out of dedication, but out of a specific motivation related to Cuba. The officers, agents and employees in the Cuba-related divisions had devoted their careers to the overthrow of Castro, and evidence of his participation in the assassination, if it had existed and could have been brought to light, would have vindicated their long-frustrated efforts, of not, in fact, led directly to a U.S. invasion of Cuba and destruction of the Castro regime.\nThat being said, the committee did not ignore the possibility that certain CIA officials who were aware that close scrutiny of U.S.-Cuban relations in the early 1960's could have inadvertently exposed the CIA-Mafia plots against Castro, might have attempted to prevent the CIA's assassination investigation or that of the Warren Commission from delving deeply into the question of Cuban complicity. The committee determined, however, that only CIA Deputy Director Richard Helms would have been in a position to have had both the requisite knowledge and the power to accomplish such a coverup, and it was satisfied, on the basis of its investigation, that it was highly unlikely he in fact did so. (199)\n19With respect to the incident at the home of Sylvia Odio in Dallas (see sec. C 3), the CIA had developed since 1963 the ability to identify from physical descriptions possible intelligence agents who may have been involved. In fact, at the committee's request, the CIA attempted to identify Odio's visitors, and it determined that they may have been members of Cuban intelligence. (195) The committee showed photographs supplied by the CIA to Odio who stated they did not appear to be the visitors in question. (196) The committee came to the conclusion that had she been shown photographs in 1963, when the event was clearer in her mind, she might have been able to make an identification. It is also regrettable that the CIA did not make use of a defector from Cuba who had worked in intelligence and who might have been able to identify the Odio visitors. (197)\nPage 129\nWhile noting the deficiencies in the CIA assassination investigation, the committee was impressed with certain overseas capabilities of the CIA in 1963. The Agency had, for example, comprehensive coverage of anti-Castro Cuban groups that, in turn, had extensive information sources in and out of Cuba. (200) Thus, while it was flawed in certain specific respects, the committee concluded that the CIA assassination investigation could, in fact, be relied on--with only limited reservations-- as a general indicator of possible Cuban involvement. That investigation found no evidence of Cuban complicity.\nTop of Page\n(i) Summary of the findings\nWhile the committee did not take Castro's denials at face value, it found persuasive reasons to conclude that the Cuban Government was not involved in the Kennedy assassination. First, by 1963 there were prospects for repairing the hostility that had marked relations between the two countries since Castro had come to power. Second, the risk of retaliation that Cuba would have incurred by conspiring in the assassination of an American President must have canceled out other considerations that might have argued for that act. President Castro's description of the idea as \"insane\" is appropriate. And there was no evidence indicating an insane or grossly reckless lack of judgment on the part of the Cuban Government. Third, the CIA had both the motive to develop evidence of Cuban involvement and access to at least substantial, if incomplete, information bearing on relevant aspects of it, had such involvement existed. Its absence, therefore, must be weighed in the balance. Finally, the Cuban Government's cooperation with this committee in the investigation must be a factor in any judgment. In conclusion, the committee found, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Cuban Government was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.\nTop of Page\n3. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES, ON THE BASIS OF THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO IT, THAT ANTI-CASTRO CUBAN GROUPS, AS GROUPS, WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY, BUT THAT THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED\nGo to the footnotes for this section.\nThe committee investigated possible involvement in the assassination by a number of anti-Castro Cuban groups and individual activists for two primary reasons:\nFirst, they had the motive, based on what they considered President Kennedy's betrayal of their cause, the liberation of Cuba from the Castro regime; the means, since they were trained and practiced in violent acts, the result of the guerrilla warfare they were waging against Castro; and the opportunity, whenever the President, as he did from time to time, appeared at public gatherings, as in Dallas on November 22, 1963.The committee, therefore, paid close attention to the activities of anti-Castro Cubans--in Miami, where most of them were concentrated and their organizations were headquartered,(1) and in New Orleans\nSecond, the committee's investigation revealed that certain associations of Lee Harvey Oswald were or may have been with anti-Castro activists.\nPage 130\nand Dallas, where Oswald, while living in these cities in the months preceding the assassination, reportedly was in contact with anti-Castro activists.(2)\nThe Warren Commission did not, of course, ignore Oswald's ties to anti-Castroites. From the evidence that was available in 1964, two Warren Commission staff attorneys, W. David Slawson and William Coleman, went so far as to speculate that Oswald, despite his public posture as a Castro sympathizer, might actually have been an agent of anti-Castro exiles.(3) Indeed, pressing for further investigation of the possibility, they wrote a memorandum which read in part:\nThe evidence here could lead to an anti-Castro involvement in the assassination on some sort of basis as this: Oswald could have become known to the Cubans as being strongly pro-Castro. He made no secret of his sympathies, so the anti-Castro Cubans must have realized that law enforcement authorities were also aware of Oswald's feelings and that, therefore, if he got into trouble, the public would also learn of them ...Second, someone in the anti-Castro organization might have been keen enough to sense that Oswald had a penchant for violence ...On these facts, it is possible that some sort of deception was used to encourage Oswald to kill the President when he came to Dallas ...The motive of this would, of course, be the expectation that after the President was killed, Oswald would be caught or at least his identity ascertained, the law enforcement authorities and the public would blame the assassination on the Castro government, and a call for its forceful overthrow would be irresistible.... (4)While it is seemingly in contradiction of Oswald's personal character and known public posture, the committee seriously considered, therefore, the possibility of an anti-Castro conspiracy in the assassination (perhaps with Oswald unaware of ifs true nature). It is appropriate to begin that consideration with an examination of the history of United States-Cuban relations from the perspective of the anti-Castro movement, beginning with the victorious end of the revolution on January 1, 1959. (5)\nTop of Page\n(a) The anti-Castro Cuban perspective\nThe anti-Castro movement began not long after Fidel Castro assumed control of Cuba. (6) at first, the Cuban people cheered the revolution and its leader for the defeat of the dictatorial Batista regime, but it was not long before many former supporters found reason to condemn the new premier's policies and politics. (7) Many Cubans were deeply disillusioned when it became apparent that the Castro government was renouncing the country's long affiliation with the United States and moving closer to the Soviet Union. (8) As Castro's preference for Marxism became evident, underground opposition movements were born. (9) They survived for a time within Cuba, but as the effectiveness of Castro's militia system was recognized, they retreated to the exile communities of Miami and other cities in the United States. (10)\nThe U.S. Government was responsive to the efforts of exiles to remove a Communist threat from the Caribbean, only 90 miles from the\nPage 131\nFlorida coast, and to recapture business investments lost to the nationalization of industry in Cuba. (11) An official, yet covert, program to train and equip exiles determined to overthrow Castro was sanctioned by President Eisenhower and his successor, President Kennedy, and carried out by the American intelligence agencies, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency. (12). The Cuban exiles, dependent on the United States for arms and logistical support, had little choice but to put their trust in Washington. (13)\nTheir trust collapsed however, at the Bay of Pigs on April 17, 1961, when an exile invasion of Cuba was annihilated by Castro's troops. (14) The failure of American airpower to support the landing shattered the confidence of the anti-Castro Cubans in the U.S. Government.(15) They blamed President Kennedy, and he publicly accepted responsibility for the defeat. (16)\nPresident Kennedy's readiness to take the blame for the Bay of Pigs served to intensify the anger of the exiles.(17) In executive session before the committee, Manuel Antonio Varona, who in 1961 was the head of the united exile organization, the Revolutionary Democratic Front, told of a tense and emotional encounter with the President at the White House, as hope for the invasion was fading.(18) \"We were not charging Mr. Kennedy with anything,\" Varona testified.(19) \"We knew he was not in charge of the military efforts directly. Nevertheless, President Kennedy told us he was the one--the only one responsible.\" (20)\nA noted Cuban attorney, Mario Lazo, summed up Cuban feeling toward President Kennedy in his book, \"Dagger in the Heart\":\nThe Bay of Pigs was wholly self-inflicted in Washington. Kennedy told the truth when he publicly accepted responsibility... The heroism of the beleaguered Cuban Brigade had been rewarded by betrayal, defeat, death for many of them, long and cruel imprisonment for the rest. The Cuban people ...had always admired the United States as strong, rich, generous--but where was its sense of honor and the capacity of its leaders? (21)President Kennedy was well aware of the bitter legacy of the Bay of Pigs debacle. Far from abandoning the Cuban exiles, he set out to convince them of his loyalty to their cause. One of the most emotionally charged events of his relationship with the Cuban exiles occurred on December 29, 1962, at the Orange Bowl in Miami. (22) He had come to welcome the survivors of the invasion force, Brigade 2506, the 1,200 men who had been ransomed from Cuba after almost 20 months in prison.(23) The President was presented with the brigade flag in a dramatic and tumultuous scene.\nThe euphoria was false and misleading. Although the Cuban exiles cheered President Kennedy that day, there also coursed through the crowd a bitter resentment among some who felt they were witnessing a display of political hypocrisy. Later, it would be claimed that the brigade feeling against President Kennedy was so strong that the presentation nearly did not take place, and it would be alleged (incorrectly, as it turned out) that the brigade flag given to Kennedy was actually a replica.(25)\nPage 132\nIt is not possible to know fully how the Bay of Pigs defeat changed President Kennedy's attitude toward Cuba, but when journalists Taylor Branch and George Crile wrote in Harper's Magazine about a massive infusion of U.S. aid to clandestine anti-Castro operations in the wake of the Bay of Pigs, they titled their article, \"The Kennedy Vendetta.\"(26) What is known is that the period between the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962 can be characterized as the high point of anti-Castro activity. (27) Miami, the center of the exile community, became a busy staging ground for armed infiltrations Cuba.(28) While not every raid was supported or even known about in advance by Government agencies, the United States played a key role in monitoring, directing and supporting the anti-Castro Cubans. (29) Although this effort was cloaked in secrecy, most Cubans in the exile community knew what was happening and who was supporting the operations. (30)\nTop of Page\n(1) The missile crisis and its aftermath.--At the time of the missile crisis in October 1962, the Cuban exiles were initially elated at the prospect of U.S. military action that might topple the Castro regime.(31) In the end, it seemed to the world that President Kennedy had the best of the confrontation with Castro and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev by demanding, and getting, the withdrawal of offensive missiles and bombers from Cuba. From the exiles' perspective, however, they had been compromised, since as part of the bargain, President Kennedy made a pledge not to invade Cuba. 20(32)\nAnti-Castro forces in the United States were all the more embittered in the spring of 1963 when the Federal Government closed down many of their training camps and guerrilla bases. (34) In cases where government raids intercepted the illegal arms transfers, weapons were confiscated and arrests were made.(35) Some anti-Castro operations did continue, however, right up to the time of the assassination, though the committee. found that U.S. backing had by that time been reduced. (36)\nTop of Page\n(2) Attitude of anti-Castro Cubans toward Kennedy.--President Kennedy's popularity among the Cuban exiles had plunged deeply by 1963. Their bitterness is illustrated in a tape recording of a meeting of anti-Castro Cubans and right-wing Americans in the Dallas suburb of Farmer's Branch on October 1, 1963. (37) In it, a Cuban identified as Nestor Castellanos vehemently criticized the United States and blamed President Kennedy for the U.S. Government's policy of \"non-interference\" with respect to the Cuban issue. (38) Holding a copy of the September 26 edition of the Dallas Morning News, featuring a front-page account of the President's planned trip to Texas in November, Castellanos vented his hostility without restraint:\nCASTELLANOS. ...we're waiting for Kennedy the 22d, buddy. We're going to see him in one way or the other. We're going to give him the works when he gets in Dallas. Mr. good ol' Kennedy. I wouldn't even call him President Kennedy He stinks.20The United States never actually signed the pledge, since it was conditioned on United Nations inspection of the weapons withdrawal that Castro would not honor. The fine point of signing the pledge was of little importance to the Cuban exiles, however, who could point out later that no invasion did, in fact, occur. (33)\nPage 133\nQUESTIONER. Are you insinuating that since this downfall came through the leader there [Castro in Cuba], that this might come to us ...?Top of Page\nCASTELLANOS. Yes ma'am, your present leader. He's the one who is doing everything right now to help the United States to become Communist.21(39)\n(b) The committee investigation\nThe committee initiated its investigation by identifying the most violent and frustrated anti-Castro groups and their leaders from among the more than 100 Cuban exile organizations in existence in November 1963. (40) These groups included Alpha 66, the Cuban Revolutionary Junta (JURE), Commandos L, the Directorio Revolutionary Estudiantil (DRE), the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) which included the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD), the Junta del Gobierno de Cuba en el Exilio (JGCE), the 30th of November, the International Penetration Forces (InterPen), the Revolutionary Recovery Movement (MRR), and the Ejercito Invasor Cubano (EIC).(41) Their election evolved both from the committee's independent field investigation and the examination of the files and records maintained by the Federal and local agencies then monitoring Cuban exile activity. These agencies included local police departments, the FBI, the CIA, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (now the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA), the Customs Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Defense.\nThe groups that received the committee's attention were \"action groups\"--those most involved in military actions and propaganda campaigns. Unlike most others, they did not merely talk about anti-Castro operations, they actually carried out infiltrations into Cuba, planned, and sometimes attempted, Castro's assassination, and shipped arms into Cuba. These were also the groups whose leaders felt most betrayed by U.S. policy toward Cuba and by the President; they were also those whose operations were frustrated by American law enforcement efforts after the missile crisis.\nTop of Page\n(1) Homer S. Echevarria.---For the most part the committee found that the anti-Castro Cuban leaders were more vociferous than potentially violent in their tirades against the President. Nevertheless, it was unable to conclude with certainty that all of the threats were benign. For example, one that the committee found particularly disturbing especially so, since it was not thoroughly looked into in the 1963-64 investigation came to the attention of the Secret Service within days of the President's death, prompting the Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago field office to write an urgent memorandum indicating he had received reliable information of \"a group in the Chicago area who [sic] may have a connection with the J.F.K. assassination.\"(43) The memorandum was based on a tip from an informant who reported a conversation on November 21, 1963, with a Cuban activist named Homer S. Echevarria.(44) They were discussing an illegal arms sale, and Echevarria was quoted as saying his group now\n21The committee uncovered no evidence that linked Castellanos to the assassination. His speech is quoted to illustrate the depth of feeling that existed in the Cuban exile community in 1963.\nPage 134\nhad \"plenty of money\" and that his backers would proceed \"as soon as we take care of Kennedy.\" (45)\nFollowing the initial memorandum, the Secret Service instructed its informant to continue his association with Echevarria and notified the Chicago FBI field office. (46) It learned that Echevarria might have been a member of the 30th of November anti-Castro organization, that he was associated with Juan Francisco Blanco-Fernandez, military director of the DRE, and that the arms deal was being financed through one Paulino Sierra Martinez by hoodlum elements in Chicago and elsewhere.(47)\nAlthough the Secret Service recommended further investigation, the FBI initially took the position that the Echevarria case \"was primarily a protection matter and that the continued investigation would be left to the U.S. Secret Service,\" (48) and that the Cuban group in question was probably not involved in illegal activities. (49) The Secret Service initially was reluctant to accept this position, since it had developed evidence that illegal acts were, in fact, involved. (50) Then, on November 29, 1963, President Johnson created the Warren Commission and gave the FBI primary investigative responsibility in the assassination.(51) Based on its initial understanding that the President's order meant primary, not exclusive, investigative responsibility, the Secret Service continued its efforts;(52) but when the FBI made clear that it wanted the Secret Service to terminate its investigation, (53) it did so, turning over its files to the FBI. (54) The FBI, in turn, did not pursue the Echevarria case. (55)\nWhile it was unable to substantiate the content of the informant's alleged conversations with Echevarria or any connection to the events in Dallas, the committee did establish that the original judgment of the Secret Service was correct, that the Echevarria case did warrant a thorough investigation. It found, for example, that the 30th of November group was backed financially by the Junta del Gobierno de Cuba en el Exilio (JGCE), a Chicago-based organization run by Paulino Sierra Martinez.(56) JGCE was a coalition of many of the more active anti-Castro groups that had been rounded in April 1963; it was dissolved soon after the assassination. 22(57) Its purpose was to back the activities of the more militant groups, including Alpha 66 and the Student Directorate, or DRE, both of which had reportedly been in contact with Lee Harvey Oswald. (58) Much of JGCE's financial support, moreover, allegedly came from individuals connected to organized crime. (59)\nAs it surveyed the various anti-Castro organizations, the committee focused its interest on reported contacts with Oswald. Unless an association with the President's assassin could be established, it is doubtful that it could be shown that the anti-Castro groups were involved in the assassination. The Warren Commission, discounting the recommendations of Slawson and Coleman, had either regarded these contacts as insignificant or as probably not having been made or else was not aware of them. (60) The committee could not so easily dismiss them.\n22The committee established-- though it could make no judgment about there having been a connection-- that many of the anti-Castro Cuban groups ceased their operations at about the time of President Kennedy's assassination. The Echevarria allegation is also discussed in section I D (1)(b) infra.\nPage 135\nTop of Page\n(2) Antonio Veciana Blanch.--The committee devoted a significant portion of its anti-Castro Cuban investigation to an alleged contact with Oswald that had been reported by Antonio Veciana Blanch, the founder of Alpha 66 which, throughout 1962 and most of 1963, was one of the most militant of the exile groups. (61) Its repeated hit-and-run attacks had drawn public criticism from President Kennedy in the spring of 1963, to which Veciana replied, \"We are going to attack again and again.\"\nVeciana claimed to have had the active support of the CIA, and in 1976 he reported to a Senate investigator that from 1960 to 1973 his adviser, whom he believed to be a representative of the CIA, was known to him as Maurice Bishop. (62) Veciana stated that over their 13-year association, he and Bishop met on over 100 occasions and that Bishop actually planned many Alpha 66 operations. (63) He also said that he knew the man only, as Maurice Bishop and that all of their contacts were initiated by Bishop. (64)\nVeciana said that Bishop had guided him in planning assassination attempts of Castro in Havana in 1961 and in Chile in 1971; that Bishop had directed him to organize Alpha 66 in 1962; and that Bishop, on ending their relationship in 1973, had paid him $253,000 in cash for his services over the years. (65) Veciana also revealed that at one meeting with Bishop in Dallas in late August or early September 1963, a third party at their meeting was a man he later recognized as Lee Harvey Oswald. (66)\nVeciana also indicated to the committee that subsequent to the assassination, he had been contacted by Bishop, who was aware that Veciana had a relative in Cuban intelligence in Mexico.(67) Bishop, according to Veciana, offered to pay Veciana's relative a large sum of money if he would say that it was he and his wife who had met with Oswald in Mexico City.(68) Veciana said he had agreed to contact his relative, but he had been unable to do so. (69)\nThe committee pursued the details of Veciana's story, particularly the alleged meeting with Oswald. It conducted numerous file reviews and interviews with associates and former associates of Veciana, to try to confirm the existence of a Maurice Bishop or otherwise assess Veciana's credibility. On a trip to Cuba, the committee interviewed Veciana's relative, the Cuban intelligence agent.\nWhile the committee was unable to find corroboration for the contacts with Bishop, it did substantiate other statements by Veciana. For example, he did organize an attempted assassination of Castro in Havana in 1961, (70) and he probably did participate in another plot against Castro in Chile in 1971. (71) That Veciana was the principal organizer of the militant Alpha 66 organization was a matter of record. (72)\nThe committee went to great lengths in its unsuccessful effort to substantiate the existence of Bishop and his alleged relationship with Oswald. It reviewed CIA files, but they showed no record of such an agent or employee. It circulated a sketch via the national news media, but no one responded with an identification. (73) It pursued a lead originating with the Senate investigation that a former chief of the CIA's Western Hemisphere Division of the Directorate of Operations bore a resemblance to the Bishop sketch.(74) The committee arranged for\nPage 136\na chance meeting between Veciana and the CIA officer, who had since retired. (75) Veciana said he was not Bishop. (76) In an executive session of the committee, the retired officer testified under oath that he had never used the name Maurice Bishop, had never known anyone by that name and had never known Veciana. (77) Veciana, also before a committee executive session, testified the officer was not Bishop although he bore a \"physical similarity.\"23(78)\nA former Director of the CIA, John McCone, and an agent who had participated in covert Cuban operations, each told the committee they recalled that a Maurice Bishop had been associated with the Agency, though neither could supply additional details.(80) Subsequently, McCone was interviewed by CIA personnel, and he told them that his original testimony to the committee had been in error. (81) The agent did confirm, however, even after a CIA reinterview, that he had seen the man known to him as Maurice Bishop three or four times at CIA headquarters in the early 1960's. (82) He did not know his organizational responsibilities, and he had not known him personally. (83) The agent also testified that he had been acquainted with the retired officer who had been chief of the Western Hemisphere Division and that he was not Bishop. (84)\nThe committee also requested flies on Bishop from the FBI and Department of Defense, with negative results.(85) It did discover, however, that Army intelligence had an operational interest in Veciana as a source of information on Alpha 66 activities, and that Veciana complied, hoping to be supplied in return with funds and weapons. (86) Veciana acknowledged his contacts with the Army, but he stated that the only relationship those contacts had to Bishop was that he kept Bishop informed of them. (87)\nThe CIA's files reflected that the Agency had been in contact with Veciana three times during the early 1960's, but the Agency maintained it offered him no encouragement.(88) (The committee could discover only one piece of arguably contradictory evidence--a record of $500 in operational expenses, given to Veciana by a person with whom the CIA had maintained a long-standing operational relationship. (89) The CIA further insisted that it did not at any time assign a case officer to Veciana. 24(90)\nThe committee was left with the task of evaluating Veciana's story, both with respect to the existence of Maurice Bishop and the alleged meeting with Oswald, by assessing Veciana's credibility. It found several reasons to believe that Veciana had been less than candid:\n23The committee suspected that Veciana was lying when he denied that the retired CIA officer was Bishop. The committee recognized that Veciana had an interest in renewing his anti-Castro operations that might have led him to protect the officer from exposure as Bishop so they could work together again. For his part, the retired officer aroused the committee's suspicion when he told the committee he did not recognize Veciana as the founder of Alpha 66, especially since the officer had once been deeply involved in Agency anti-Castro operations. Further, a former CIA case officer who was assigned from September 1960 to November 1962 to the JM/WAVE station in Miami told the committee that the retired officer had in fact used the alias, Maurice Bishop. The committee also interviewed a former assistant of the retired officer but he could not recall his former superior ever having used the name or having been referred to as Bishop. (79)\n24The committee found it probable that some agency of the United States assigned a case officer to Veciana, since he was the dominant figure in an extremely active anti-Castro organization. The committee established that the CIA assigned case officers to Cuban revolutionaries of less importance than Veciana, though it could not draw from that alone an inference of CIA deception of the committee concerning Veciana, since Bishop could well have been in the employ of one of the military intelligence agencies or even perhaps of some foreign power.\nPage 137\nFirst, Veciana waited more than 10 years after the assassination to reveal his story.In the absence of corroboration or independent substantiation, the committee could not, therefore, credit Veciana's story of having met with Lee Harvey Oswald.\nSecond, Veciana would not supply proof of the $253,000 payment from Bishop, claiming fear of the Internal Revenue Service.\nThird, Veciana could not point to a single witness to his meetings with Bishop, much less with Oswald.\nFourth, Veciana did little to help the committee identify Bishop.\nTop of Page\n(3) Silvia Odio. The incident of reported contact between Oswald and anti-Castro Cubans that has gained the most attention over the years involved Silvia Odio, a member of the Cuban Revolutionary Junta, or JURE. (91) Mrs. Odio had not volunteered her information to the FBI.(92) The FBI initially contacted Mrs. Odio after hearing of a conversation she had had with her neighbor in which she described an encounter with Lee Harvey Oswald. (93) Subsequently, in testimony before the Warren Commission, she said that in late September 1963, three men came to her home in Dallas to ask for help in preparing a fundraising letter for JURE.(94) She stated that two of the men appeared to be Cubans, although they also had characteristics that she associated with Mexicans. (95) The two individuals, she remembered, indicated that their \"war\" names were \"Leopoldo\" and \"Angelo.\"(96) The third man, an American, was introduced to her as \"Leon Oswald,\" and she was told that he was very much interested in the anti-Castro Cuban cause. (97)\nMrs. Odio stated that the men told her that they had just come from New Orleans and that they were then about to leave on a trip. (98) The next day, one of the Cubans called her on the telephone and told her that it had been his idea to introduce the American into the underground \"...because he is great, he is kind of nuts.\" (99) The Cuban also said that the American had been in the Marine Corps and was an excellent shot, and that the American had said that Cubans \"...don't have any guts ...because President Kennedy should have been assassinated after the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should have done that, because he was the one that was holding the freedom of Cuba actually.\"(100) Mrs. Odio claimed the American was Lee Harvey Oswald. (101)\nMrs. Odio's sister, who was in the apartment at the time of the visit by the three men and who stated that she saw them briefly in the hallway when answering the door, also believed that the American was Lee Harvey Oswald. (102) Mrs. Odio fixed the date of the alleged visit as being September 26 or 27.(103) She was positive that the visit occurred prior to October 1. (104)\nThe Warren Commission was persuaded that Oswald could not have been in Dallas on the dates given by Mrs. Odio. (105) Nevertheless, it requested the FBI to conduct further investigation into her allegation, and it acknowledged that the FBI had not completed its Odio investigation at the time its report was published in September 1964. (106)\nHow the Warren Commission treated the Odio incident is instructive. In the summer of 1964, the FBI was pressed to dig more deeply into the Odio allegation. (107) On July 24, chief counsel J. Lee Rankin,\nPage 138\nin a letter to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, noted, \"... the Commission already possesses firm evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald was on a bus traveling from Houston, Tex., to Mexico City, Mexico, on virtually the entire day of September 26.\"(108) J. Wesley Liebeler, the Warren Commission assistant counsel who had taken Mrs. Odio's deposition, disagreed, however, that there was firm evidence of Oswald's bus trip to Mexico City. (109) In a memorandum to another Commission attorney, Howard Willens, on September 14, 1964, Liebeler objected to a section of the Warren Report in which it was stated there was strong evidence that Oswald was on a bus to Mexico on the date in question.(110) Liebeler argued, \"There really is no evidence at all that [Oswald] left Houston on that bus.\"(111) Liebeler also argued that the conclusion that there was \"persuasive\" evidence that Oswald was not in Dallas on September 24, 1963, a day for which his travel was unaccounted, was \"too strong.\" (112) Liebeler urged Willens to tone down the language, of the report,(113) contending in his memorandum:\"There are problems. Odio may well be right. The Commission will look bad if it turns out that she is.\" (114)\nOn August 23, 1964, Rankin again wrote to Hoover to say, \"It is a matter of some importance to the Commission that Mrs. Odio's allegation either be proved or disproved.\" (115) Rankin asked that the FBI attempt to learn the identities of the three visitors by contacting members of anti-Castro groups active in the Dallas area, as well as leaders of the JURE organization. (116) He asked the FBI to check the possibility that Oswald had spent the night of September 24, in a hotel in New Orleans, after vacating his apartment. (117) Portions of this investigation, which were inconclusive in supporting the Warren Commission's contention that Mrs. Odio was mistaken, were not sent to Rankin until November 9,(118) at which time the final report already had been completed. (119)\nThe FBI did attempt to alleviate the \"problems.\" In a report dated September 26, it reported the interview of Loran Eugene Hall who claimed he had been in Dallas in September 1963, accompanied by two men fitting the general description given by Silvia Odio, and that it was they who had visited her. (120) Oswald, Hall said, was not one of the men.(121) Within a week of Hall's statement, the other two men Hall said had accompanied him. Lawrence Howard and William Seymour, were interviewed.(122) They denied ever having met Silvia Odio. (123) Later, Hall himself retracted his statement about meeting with Mrs. Odio. (124)\nEven though the Commission could not show conclusively that Oswald was not at the Odio apartment, and even though Loran Hall's story was an admitted fabrication, the Warren report published this explanation of the Odio incident:\nWhile the FBI had not yet completed its investigation into this matter at the time the report went to press, the Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was not at Mrs. Odio's apartment in September 1963. (125)Not satisfied with that conclusion, the committee conducted interviews with and took depositions from the principals--Silvia Odio,(126) members of her family,(127) and Dr. Burton Einspruch,\nPage 139\n(128) her psychiatrist. (Mrs. Odio had contacted Dr. Einspruch for consultation about problems that could not be construed to affect her perception or credibility.) (129) The committee also set up a conference telephone call between Dr. Einspruch in Dallas and Silvia Odio in Miami, during which she related to him the visit of the three men. (130) Mrs. Odio and Dr. Einspruch concurred that she had told him of the nighttime meeting shortly after its occurrence, but prior to the president's assassination.(131)\nLoran Hall testified before the committee in executive session on October 5, 1977; Howard and Seymour were interviewed.(132) The FBI agent who wrote up the Hall story also testified before the committee. (133) From a review of FBI files, the committee secured a list of persons who belonged to the Dallas Chapter of JURE, and the committee attempted to locate and interview these individuals. Additionally, staff investigators interviewed the leader of JURE, Manolo Ray, who was residing in Puerto Rico. (134)\nFurther, the committee secured photographs of scores of pro-Castro and anti-Castro activists who might have fit the descriptions of the two individuals who, Mrs. Odio said, had visited her with Oswald. (135) The committee also used the resources of the CIA which conducted a check on all individuals who used the \"war\" names of \"Leopoldo\" and \"Angelo\", and the name \"Leon\", or had similar names. (136) An extensive search produced the names and photographs of three men who might possibly have, been in Dallas in September 1963. (137) These photographs were shown to Mrs. Odio, but she was unable to identify them as the men she had seen. (138)\nThe committee was inclined to believe Silvia Odio. From the evidence provided in the sworn testimony of the witnesses, it appeared that three men did visit her apartment in Dallas prior to the Kennedy assassination and identified themselves as members of an anti-Castro organization. Based on a judgment of the credibility of Silvia and Annie Odio, one of these men at least looked like Lee Harvey Oswald and was introduced to Mrs. Odio as Leon Oswald.\nThe committee did not agree with the Warren Commission's conclusion that Oswald could not have been in Dallas at the requisite time. Nevertheless, the committee itself could reach no definite conclusion on the specific date of the visit. It could have been as early as September 24, the morning of which Oswald was seen in New Orleans,(139) but it was more likely on the 25th, 26th or 27th of September. If it was on these dates, then Oswald had to have had access to private transportation to have traveled through Dallas and still reached Mexico City when he did, judging from other evidence developed by both the Warren Commission and the committee. (140)\nTop of Page\n(c) Oswald and anti-Castro Cubans\nThe committee recognized that an association by Oswald with anti-Castro Cubans would pose problems for its evaluation of the assassin and what might have motivated him. In reviewing Oswald's life, the committee found his actions and values to have been those of a self-proclaimed Marxist who would be bound to favor the Castro regime in Cuba, or at least not advocate its overthrow. For this reason, it did not seem likely to the committee that Oswald would have allied\nPage 140\nhimself with an anti-Castro group or individual activist for the sole purpose of furthering the anti-Castro cause. The committee recognized the possibility that Oswald might have established contacts with such groups or persons to implicate the anti-Castro movement in the assassination. Such an implication might have protected the Castro regime and other left-wing suspects, while resulting in an intensive investigation and possible neutralization of the opponents of Castro. It is also possible, despite his alleged remark about killing Kennedy, that Oswald had not yet contemplated the President's assassination at the time of the Odio incident, or if he did, that his assassination plan had no relation to his anti-Castro contacts, and that he was associating with anti-Castro activists for some other unrelated reason. A variety of speculations are possible, but the committee was forced to acknowledge frankly that, despite its efforts, it was unable to reach firm conclusions as to the meaning or significance of the Odio incident to the President's assassination.\nTop of Page\n(1) Oswald in New Orleans.--Another contact by Lee Harvey Oswald with anti-Castro Cuban activists that was not only documented, but also publicized at the time in the news media, occurred when he was living in New Orleans in the summer of 1963, an especially puzzling period in Oswald's life. His actions were blatantly pro-Castro, as he carried a one-man Fair Play for Cuba Committee crusade into the streets of a city whose Cuban population was predominantly anti-Castro. Yet Oswald's known and alleged associations even at this time included Cubans who were of an anti-Castro persuasion and their anti-Communist American supporters.\nNew Orleans was Oswald's home town; he was born there on October 18, 1939.(141) In April 1963, shortly after the Walker shooting, he moved back, having lived in Fort Worth and Dallas since his return from the Soviet Union the previous June.(142) He spent the first 2 weeks job hunting, staying with the Murrets, Lillian and Charles, or \"Dutz,\" as he was called, the sister and brother-in-law of Oswald's mother, Marguerite. (143) After being hired by the Reily Coffee Co. as a maintenance man, he sent for his wife Marina and their baby daughter, who were still in Dallas, and they moved into an apartment on Magazine Street.\nIn May, Oswald wrote to Vincent T. Lee, national director of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, expressing a desire to open an FPCC chapter in New Orleans and requesting literature to distribute. (145) He also had handouts printed, some of which were stamped \"L. H. Oswald, 4907 Magazine Street,\" others with the alias, \"A. J. Hidell, P.O. Box 30016,\" still others listing the FPCC address as 544 Camp Street. (146)\nIn letters written earlier that summer and spring to the FPCC headquarters in New York, Oswald had indicated that he intended to rent an office.(147) In one letter he mentioned that he had acquired a space but had been told to vacate 3 days later because the building was to be remodeled. The Warren Commission failed to discover any record of Oswald's having rented an office at 544 Camp and concluded he had fabricated the story. (149)\nIn investigating Oswald after the assassination, the Secret Service learned that the New Orleans chapter of the Cuban Revolutionary\nPage 141\nCouncil (CRC), an anti-Castro organization, had occupied an office at 544 Camp Street for about 6 months during 1961-62.(150) At that time, Sergio Arcacha Smith was the official CRC delegate for the New Orleans area.(151) Since the CRC had vacated the building 15 months before Oswald arrived in New Orleans, the Warren Commission concluded that there was no connection with Oswald.(152) Nevertheless, the riddle of 544 Camp Street persisted over the years.\nOswald lost his job at the Reily Coffee Co. in July, and his efforts to find another were futile.(153) Through the rest of the summer, he filed claims at the unemployment office.\nOn August 5, Oswald initiated contact with Carlos Bringuier, a delegate of the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE).(155) According to his testimony before the Warren Commission, Bringuier was the only registered member of the group in New Orleans. (156) Bringuier also said he had two friends at the time, Celso Hernandez and Miguel Cruz, who were also active in the anti-Castro cause. (157) Oswald reportedly told Bringuier that he wished to join the DRE, offering money and assistance to train guerrillas.(158) Bringuier, fearful of an infiltration attempt by Castro sympathizers or the FBI, told Oswald to deal directly with DRE headquarters in Miami. (159) The next day, Oswald returned to Bringuier's store and left a copy of a Marine training manual with Rolando Pelaez, Bringuier's brother-in-law. (160)\nOn August 9, Bringuier learned that a man was carrying a pro-Castro sign and handing out literature on Canal Street. (161) Carrying his own anti-Castro sign, Bringuier, along with Hernandez and Cruz, set out to demonstrate against the pro-Castro sympathizer. (162) Bringuier recognized Oswald and began shouting that he was a traitor and a Communist.(163) A scuffle ensued, and police arrested all participants.(164) Oswald spent the night in jail.(165) On August 12, he pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace and was fined $10. (166) The anti-Castro Cubans were not charged. (167)\nDuring the incident with Bringuier, Oswald also encountered Frank Bartes, the New Orleans delegate of the CRC from 1962-64.(168) After Bringuier and Oswald were arrested in the street scuffle, Bartes appeared in court with Bringuier. (169) According Bartes, the news media surrounded Oswald for a statement after the hearing. (170) Bartes then engaged in an argument with the media and Oswald because the Cubans were not being given an opportunity to present their anti-Castro views. (171)\nOn August 16, Oswald was again seen distributing pro-Castro literature.(172) A friend of Bringuier, Carlos Quiroga, brought one of Oswald's leaflets to Bringuier and volunteered to visit Oswald and feign interest in the FPCC in order to determine Oswald's motives. (173) Quiroga met with Oswald for about an hour.(174) He learned that Oswald had a Russian wife and spoke Russian himself. Oswald gave Quiroga an application for membership in the FPCC chapter, but Quiroga noted he did not seem intent on actually enlisting members. (175)\nOswald's campaign received newspaper, television, and radio coverage. (176) William Stuckey, a reporter for radio station WDSU who had been following the FPCC, interviewed Oswald on August 17 and\nPage 142\nproposed a television debate between Oswald and Bringuier, to be held on August 21. (177) Bringuier issued a press release immediately after the debate, urging the citizens of New Orleans to write their Congressmen demanding a congressional investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald.(178)\nOswald largely passed out of sight from August 21 until September 17, the day he applied for a tourist card to Mexico.(179) He is known to have written letters to left-wing political organizations, and he and Marina visited the Murrets on Labor Day. (180) Marina said her husband spent his free time reading books and practicing with his rifle. (181)\nTop of Page\n(2) Oswald in Clinton, La.--While reports of some Oswald contacts with anti-Castro Cubans were known at the time of the 1964 investigation, allegations of additional Cuba-related associations surfaced in subsequent years. As an example, Oswald reportedly appeared in August-September 1963 in Clinton, La., where a voting rights demonstration was in progress. The reports of Oswald in Clinton were not, as far as the committee could determine, available to the Warren Commission, although one witness said he notified the FBI when he recognized Oswald from news photographs right after the assassination.25(182) In fact, the Clinton sightings did not publicly surface until 1967, when they were introduced as evidence in the assassination investigation being conducted by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison.(184) In that investigation, one suspect, David W. Ferrie, a staunch anti-Castro partisan, died within days of having been named by Garrison; the other, Clay L. Shaw, was acquitted in 1969.(185) Aware that Garrison had been fairly criticized for questionable tactics, the committee proceeded cautiously, making sure to determine on its own the credibility of information coming from his probe. The committee found that the Clinton witnesses were credible and significant. They each were interviewed or deposed, or appeared before the committee in executive session. While there were points that could be raised to call into question their credibility, it was the judgment of the committee that they were telling the truth as they knew it.\nThere were six Clinton witnesses, among them a State representative, a deputy sheriff and a registrar of voters. (186) By synthesizing the testimony of all of them, since they each contributed to the overall account, the committee was able to piece together the following sequence of events.\nClinton, La. about 130 miles from New Orleans, is the county seat of East Feliciana Parish. In the late summer of 1963 it was targeted by the Congress of Racial Equality for a voting rights campaign. (187) Oswald first showed up in nearby Jackson, La., seeking employment at East Louisiana State Hospital, a mental institution. (188) Apparently on advice that his job would depend on his becoming a registered voter, Oswald went to Clinton for that purpose (although the committee could find no record that he was successful. (189)\nIn addition to the physical descriptions they gave that matched that of Oswald, other observations of the witnesses tended to substanti-\n25Reeves Morgan, a member of the Louisiana Legislature, testified he was called back by the FBI a few days later and asked what Oswald had been wearing. He said he was not contacted again. The FBI had not record of Morgan's call. (183)\nPage 143\nate their belief that he was, in fact, the man they saw. For example, he referred to himself as \"Oswald,\" and he produced his Marine Corps discharge papers as identification.(190) Some of the witnesses said that Oswald was accompanied by two older men whom they identified as Ferrie and Shaw. (191) If the witnesses were not only truthful but accurate as well in their accounts, they established an association of an undetermined nature between Ferrie, Shaw and Oswald less than 3 months before the assassination.\nTop of Page\n(3) David Ferrie.--The Clinton witnesses were not the only ones who linked Oswald to Ferrie. On November 23, the day after the assassination, Jack S. Martin, a part-time private detective and police informant, told the office of the New Orleans District Attorney that a former Eastern Airlines pilot named David Ferrie might have aided Oswald in the assassination. (192) Martin had known Ferrie for over 2 years, beginning when he and Ferrie had performed some investigative work on a case involving an illegitimate religious order in Louisville, Ky. (193) Martin advised Assistant New Orleans District Attorney Herman Kohlman that he suspected Ferrie might have known Oswald for some time and that Ferrie might have once been Oswald's superior officer in a New Orleans unit of the Civil Air Patrol.(194) Martin made further allegations to the FBI on November 25.(195) He indicated he thought he once saw a photograph of Oswald and other CAP members when he visited Ferrie's home and that Ferrie might have assisted Oswald in purchasing a foreign firearm.(196) Martin also informed the FBI that Ferrie had a history of arrests and that Ferrie was an amateur hypnotist, possibly capable of hypnotizing Oswald. (197)\nThe committee reviewed Ferrie's background. He had been fired by Eastern Airlines,(198) and in litigation over the dismissal, which continued through August 1963, he was counseled by a New Orleans attorney named G. Wray Gill. (199) Ferrie later stated that in March 1960, he and Gill made an agreement whereby Gill would represent Ferrie in his dismissal dispute in return for Ferrie's work as an investigator on other cases. (200) One of these cases involved deportation proceedings against Carlos Marcello, the head of the organized crime network in Louisiana and a client of Gill.26(201) Ferrie also said he had entered into a similar agreement with Guy Banister, a former FBI agent (Special Agent-in-Charge in Chicago) who had opened a private detective agency in New Orleans. (203)\nTop of Page\n(4) 544 Camp Street.--Banister's firm occupied an office in 1963 in the Newman Building at 531 Lafayette Street. (204) Another entrance to the building was at 544 Camp Street, the address Oswald had stamped on his Fair Play for Cuba Committee handouts. (205) During the summer of 1963, Ferrie frequented 544 Camp Street regularly as a result of his working relationship with Banister. (206)\nAnother occupant of the Newman Building, was the Cuban Revolutionary Council, whose chief New Orleans delegate until 1962 was Ser-\n26The committee learned that Ferrie's associations with Marcello might have begun earlier. An unconfirmed U.S. border Patrol report indicated that in February 1962, Ferrie piloted an airplane that returned Marcello to the United States following his ouster from the country by Federal agents in April 1961, as part of the Kennedy administration's crackdown on organized crime. Marcello denied to the committee in executive session that Ferrie flew him out of Latin America, saying that he flew commercial airlines. Records do not exist that can confirm or refute this contention. (202)\nPage 144\ngio Arcacha Smith. (207) He was replaced by Luis Rabel who, in turn, was succeeded by Frank Bartes.(208) The committee interviewed or deposed all three CRC New Orleans delegates. (209) Arcacha said he never encountered Oswald and that he left New Orleans when he was relieved of his CRC position in early 1962. (210) Rabel said he held the post from January to October 1962, but that he likewise never knew or saw Oswald and that the only time he went to the Newman Building was to remove some office materials that Arcacha had left there. (211) Bartes said the only time he was in contact with Oswald was in their courtroom confrontation, that he ran the CRC chapter from an office in his home and that he never visited an office at either 544 Camp Street or 531 Lafayette Street. (212)\nThe committee, on the other hand, developed information that, in 1961, Banister, Ferrie, and Arcacha were working together in the anti-Castro cause. Banister, a fervent anti-Communist, was helping to establish Friends of Democratic Cuba as an adjunct to the New Orleans CRC chapter run by Arcacha in an office in the Newman Building. (213) Banister was also conducting background investigations of CRC members for Arcacha.(214) Ferrie, also strongly anti-Communist and anti-Castro, was associated with Arcacha (and probably Banister) in anti-Castro activism. (215)\nOn November 22, 1963, Ferrie had been in a Federal courtroom in New Orleans in connection with legal proceedings against Carlos Marcello.27(216) That night he drove, with two young friends, to Houston, Tex. then to Galveston on Saturday, November 23, and back to New Orleans on Sunday. (218) Before reaching New Orleans, he learned from a telephone conversation with G. Wray Gill that Martin had implicated him in the, assassination.(219) Gill also told Ferrie about the rumors that he and Oswald had served together in the CAP and that Oswald supposedly had Ferrie's library card in his possession when he was arrested in Dallas.(220) When he got to his residence, Ferrie did not go in, but sent in his place one of his companions on the trip, Alvin Beauboeuf.(221) Beauboeuf and Ferrie's roommate, Layton Martens, were detained by officers from the district attorney's office. (222) Ferrie drove to Hammond, La, and spent the night with a friend. (223)\nOn Monday, November 25, Ferrie turned himself in to the district attorney's office where he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the assassination. (224) In subsequent interviews with New Orleans authorities, the FBI and the Secret Service, Ferrie denied ever having known Oswald or having ever been involved in the assassination. (225) He stated that in the days preceding, November 22, he had been working intensively for Gill on the Marcello case. (226) Ferrie said he was in New Orleans on the morning of November 22, at which time Marcello was acquitted in Federal court of citizenship falsification. (227) He stated that he took the weekend trip to Texas for relaxation.(228) Ferrie acknowledged knowing Jack Martin, stating that Martin resented him for forcibly removing him from Gill's office earlier that year. (229)\n27With Ferrie's employer G. Wray Gill as his counsel, Marcello was successfully resisting any attempt by the Government to have him legally deported or convicted of a crime. (217)\nPage 145\nThe FBI and Secret Service investigation into the possibility that Ferrie and Oswald head been associated ended a few days later.(230) A Secret Service report concluded that the information provided by Jack Martin that Ferrie had been associated with Oswald and had trained him to fire, a rifle was \"without foundation.\" (231) The Secret Service report went on to state that on November 26, 1963, the FBI had informed the Secret Service that Martin had admitted that his information was a \"figment of his imagination.\" 28(232) The investigation of Ferrie was subsequently closed for lack of evidence against him.(234)\nTop of Page\n(5) A committee analysis of Oswald in New Orleans.---The Warren Commission had attempted to reconstruct a daily chronology of Oswald's activities in New Orleans during the summer of 1963, and the committee used it, as well as information arising from critics and the Garrison investigation, to select events and contacts that merited closer analysis. Among these were Oswald's confrontation with Carlos Bringuier and with Frank Bartes, his reported activities in Clinton, La., and his ties, if any, to Guy Banister, David Ferrie, Sergio Arcacha Smith and others who frequented the office building at 544 Camp Street. The committee deposed Carlos Bringuier and interviewed or deposed several of his associates. (235) It concluded that there had been no relationship between Oswald and Bringuier and the DRE with the exception of the confrontation over Oswald's distribution of pro-Castro literature. The committee was not able to determine why Oswald approached the anti-Castro Cubans, but it tended to concur with Bringuier and others in their belief that Oswald was seeking to infiltrate their ranks and obtain information about their activities.\nAs noted, the committee believed the Clinton witnesses to be telling the truth as they knew it. It was, therefore, inclined to believe that Oswald was in Clinton, La., in late August, early September 1963, and that he was in the company of David Ferrie, if not Clay Shaw. The committee was puzzled by Oswald's apparent association with Ferrie, a person whose anti-Castro sentiments were so distant from those of Oswald, the Fair Play for Cuba Committee campaigner. But the relationship with Ferrie may have been significant for more than its anti-Castro aspect, in light of Ferrie's connection with G. Wray Gill and Carlos Marcello.\nThe committee also found that there was at least possibility that Oswald and Guy Banister were acquainted. The following facts were considered:\nThe 544 Camp Street address stamped on Oswald's FPCC handouts was that of the building where Banister had his office;28It appeared to the committee that the FBI overstated Martin's recantation in its information to the Secret Service. Martin had cautioned the FBI that he had no evidence to support his suspicions but that he believed they merited investigation. (233)\nRoss Banister told the committee that his brother had seen Oswald handing out FPCC literature during the summer of 1963; (236) and\nBanister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, told the committee she saw Oswald in Banister's office on several occasions, the first being\nPage 146\nwhen he was interviewed for a job during the summer of 1963.29(237)The committee learned that Banister left extensive files when he died in 1964.(238) Later that year, they were purchased by the Louisiana State Police from Banister's widow.(239) According to Joseph Cambre of the State police, Oswald's name was not the subject of any file, but it was included in a file for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.(240) Cambre said the FPCC file contained newspaper clippings and a transcript, of a radio program on which Oswald had appeared. (241) The committee was not able to review Banister's files, since they had been destroyed pursuant to an order of the superintendent of Louisiana State Police that all files not part of the public record or pertinent to ongoing criminal investigations be burned. (242)\nAdditional evidence that Oswald may have been associated or acquainted with Ferrie and Banister was provided by the testimony of Adrian Alba, proprietor of the Crescent City Garage which was next door to the Reily Coffee Co. where Oswald had worked for a couple of months in 1963. (The garage and the coffee company were both located less than a block from 544 Camp Street.) Although Alba's testimony on some points was questionable, he undoubtedly did know Oswald who frequently visited his garage, and the committee found no reason to question his statement that he had often seen Oswald in Mancuso's Restaurant on the first floor of 544 Camp. (243) Ferrie and Banister also were frequent customers at Mancuso's. (244)\nTop of Page\n(6) Summary of the evidence.--In sum, the committee did not believe that an anti-Castro organization was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. Even though the committee's investigation did reveal that in 1964 the FBI failed to pursue intelligence reports of possible anti-Castro involvement as vigorously as it might have, the committee found it significant that it discovered no information in U.S. intelligence agency files that would implicate anti-Castroites. Contact between the intelligence community and the anti-Castro movement was close, so it is logical to suppose that some trace of group involvement would have been detected had it existed.\nThe committee also thought it significant that it received no information from the Cuban Government that would implicate anti-Castroites. The Cubans had dependable information sources in the exile communities in Miami, New Orleans, Dallas and other U.S. cities, so there is high probability that Cuban intelligence would have been aware of any group involvement by the exiles. Following the assassination, the Cuban Government would have had the highest incentive to report participation by anti-Castroites, had it existed to its knowledge, since it would have dispelled suspicions of pro-Castro Cuban involvement.\nThe committee was impressed with the cooperation it received from the Cuban Government, and while it acknowledged this cooperation might not have been forthcoming in 1964, it concluded that, had such information existed in 1978, it would have been supplied by Cuban officials.\nOn the other hand, the committee noted that it was unable to preclude from its investigation the possibility that individuals with anti-\n29The committee did not credit the Roberts' testimony standing alone. It came late in the investigation and without corroboration or independent substantiation, and much of Roberts' other testimony lacked credibility.\nPage 147\nCastro leanings might have been involved in the assassination. The committee candidly acknowledged, for example that it could not explain Oswald's associations--nor at this late date fully determine their extent--with anti-Castro Cubans. The committee remained convinced that since Oswald consistently demonstrated a left-wing Marxist ideology, he would not have supported the anti-Castro movement. At the same time, the committee noted that Oswald's possible association with Ferrie might be distinguishable, since it could not be simply termed an anti-Castro association. Ferrie and Oswald may have had a personal friendship unrelated to Cuban activities. Ferrie was not Cuban, and though he actively supported the anti-Castro cause, he had other interests. For one, he was employed by Carlos Marcello as an investigator. (245) (It has been alleged that Ferrie operated a service station in 1964 the franchise for which was reportedly paid by Marcello.) (246) The committee concluded, therefore, that Oswald's most significant apparent anti-Castro association, that with David Ferrie, might in fact not have been related to the Cuban issue.\nIn the end, the committee concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that anti-Castro Cuban groups, as groups, were not involved in the assassination, but it could not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved. 4.THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES, ON THE BASIS OF THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO IT, THAT THE NATIONAL SYNDICATE OF ORGANIZED CRIME AS A GROUP, WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY, BUT THAT THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED\nGo to the footnotes for this section.\nLee Harvey Oswald was fatally shot by Jack Ruby at 11:21 a.m on Sunday, November 24, 1963, less than 48 hours after President Kennedy was assassinated. While many Americans were prepared to believe that Oswald had acted alone in shooting the President, they found their credulity strained when they were asked to accept a conclusion that Ruby, too, had not acted as part of a plot. As the Warren Commission observed,\n...almost immediately speculation arose that Ruby had acted on behalf of members of a conspiracy who had planned the killing of President Kennedy and wanted to silence Oswald. (1).The implications of the murder of Oswald are crucial to an understanding of the assassination itself. Several of the logical possibilities should be made explicit:\nOswald was a member of a conspiracy, and he was killed by Ruby, also a conspirator, so that he would not reveal the plot.Page 148\nOswald was a member of a conspiracy, yet Ruby acted alone, as he explained, for personal reasons.\nOswald was not a member of a conspiracy as far as Ruby knew, but his murder was an act planned by Ruby and others to take justice into their own hands.\nBoth Oswald and Ruby acted alone or with the assistance of only one or two confederates, but there was no wider conspiracy, one that extended beyond the immediate participants.\nIf it is determined that Ruby acted alone, it does not necessarily follow that there was no conspiracy to murder the President. But if Ruby was part of a sophisticated plot to murder Oswald, there would be troublesome implications with respect to the assassination of the President. While it is possible to develop an acceptable rationale of why a group might want to kill the President's accused assassin, even though its members were not in fact involved in the assassination, it is difficult to make the explanation sound convincing. There is a possibility, for example, that a Dallas citizen or groups of citizens planned the murder of Oswald by Ruby to revenge the murders of President Kennedy or Patrolman J.D. Tippit, or both. Nevertheless, the brief period of time between the two murders, during which the vengeful plotters would have had to formulate and execute Oswald's murder, would seem to indicate the improbability of such an explanation. A preexisting group might have taken action within 48 hours, but it is doubtful that a group could have planned and then carried out Oswald's murder in such a short period of time.\nTop of Page\n(a) The Warren Commission investigation\nThe Warren Commission looked at Ruby's conduct and associations from November 21 through November 24 to determine if they reflected a conspiratorial relationship with Oswald.(2) It found no \"... grounds for believing that Ruby's killing of Oswald was part of a conspiracy.\"(3) It accepted as true his explanation that his conduct reflected \"genuine shock and grief\" and strong affection for President Kennedy and his family. (4) As for numerous phone contacts Ruby had with underworld figures in the weeks preceding the assassination, the Commission believed his explanation that they had to do with his troubles with the American Guild of Variety Artists, rather than reflecting any sinister associations that might have been related to the President's assassination. (5)\nThe Commission also found no evidence that Ruby and Oswald had ever been acquainted, although the Commission acknowledged that they both lived in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, had post office boxes at the terminal annex, and had possible but tenuous third party links. These included Oswald's landlady, Earlene Roberts, whose sister, Bertha Cheek, had visited Ruby at his nightclub on November 18, (6) and a fellow boarder at Oswald's roominghouse, John Carter, who was friendly with a close friend and employee of Ruby, Wanda Killam.(7).\nThe Commission also looked to Ruby's ties to other individuals or groups that might have obviated the need for direct contact with Oswald near the time of the assassination. Ruby was found not to be linked to pro- or anti-Castro Cuban groups;(8) he was also found not to be linked to \"illegal activities with members of the organized underworld.\"(9) The Commission noted that Ruby \"disclaimed that he was associated with organized criminal activities,\" and it did not find reason to disbelieve him. (10) The evidence \"fell short\" of demonstrating that Ruby \"was significantly affiliated with organized crime.\"(11) He was, at worst, \"familiar, if not friendly\" with some\nPage 149\ncriminal elements, but he was not a participant in \"organized criminal activity.\" (12) Consequently, the Commission concluded that \"the evidence does not establish a significant link between Ruby and organized crime? (13) And in its central conclusion about Jack Ruby, the Commission stated that its investigation had \"yielded no evidence that Ruby conspired with anyone in planning or executing the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.\"(14) For the Warren Commission, therefore, Ruby's killing of Oswald had no implications for Oswald's killing of the President.\nTop of Page\n(b) The committee investigation\nLike the Warren Commission, the committee was deeply troubled by the circumstances surrounding the murder of the President's accused assassin. It, too, focused its attention on Jack Ruby, his family and his associates. Its investigation, however, was not limited to Ruby, Oswald and their immediate world. The committee's attention was also directed to organized crime and those major figures in it who might have been involved in a conspiracy to kill the President because of the Kennedy administration's unprecedented crackdown on them and their illicit activities.\nTop of Page\n(1) Ruby and organized crime.--The committee, as did the Warren Commission, recognized that a primary reason to suspect organized crime of possible involvement in the assassination was Ruby's killing of Oswald. For this reason, the committee undertook an extensive investigation of Ruby and his relatives, friends and associates to determine if there was evidence that Ruby was involved in crime, organized or otherwise, such as gambling and vice, and if such involvement might have been related to the murder of Oswald.\nThe evidence available to the committee indicated that Ruby was not a \"member\" of organized crime in Dallas or elsewhere, although it showed that he had a significant number of associations and direct and indirect contacts with underworld figures, a number of whom were connected to the most powerful La Cosa Nostra leaders. Additionally, Ruby had numerous associations with the Dallas criminal element. The committee examined the circumstances of a well-known episode in organized crime history in which representatives of the Chicago Mafia attempted in, 1947, a move into Dallas, facilitated by the bribery of members of the Dallas sheriff's office. (15) The Kefauver committee of the U.S. Senate, during, its extensive probe of organized crime in the early 1950's, termed this attempt by the Chicago syndicate to buy protection from the Dallas authorities an extraordinary event, one of the more brazen efforts made during that postwar period of criminal expansion.\nIn the years since the assassination, there had been allegations that Ruby was involved in organized crime's 1947 attempt to move into Dallas, perhaps as a frontman for the Chicago racketeers. (16) During discussions of the bribe offer, Dallas Sheriff Steve Guthrie secretly taped conversations in which the Chicago mob representative outlined plans for its Dallas operation. (17) They spoke of establishing a nightclub as a front for illegal gambling. It happens that Ruby moved from Chicago to Dallas in 1947 and began operating a number of nightclubs. (18) While the FBI and the Warren Commission were aware in 1964 of the alleged links between Ruby and those involved in the\nPage 150\nbribery attempt, a thorough investigation of the charges was not undertaken. (19)\nThe committee frankly realized that because this incident occurred years in the past, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to answer all the allegations fully and finally. Nevertheless, the committee was able to develop substantial evidence from tape recordings made by the sheriff's office, detailed law enforcement documents and the testimony of knowledgeable witnesses.\nAs a result, the committee concluded that while Ruby and members of his family were acquainted with individuals who were involved in the incident, including Chicago gangsters who had moved to Dallas, and while Ruby may have wished to participate, there was no solid evidence that he was, in fact, part of the Chicago group. (20) There was also no evidence available that Ruby was to have been involved in the proposed gambling operation had the bribery attempt been successful, or that Ruby came to Dallas for that purpose. (21)\nThe committee found it reasonable to assume that had Ruby been involved in any significant way, he would probably have been referred to in either the tape recordings or the documentation relating to the incident, but a review of that available evidence failed to disclose any reference to Ruby. (22) The committee, however, was not able to interview former Sheriff Guthrie, the subject of the bribery attempt and the one witness who maintained to the FBI in 1963-64 that Ruby was significantly involved in the Chicago syndicate plan.1(23)\nThe committee also examined allegations that, even before the 1947 move to Dallas, Ruby had been personally acquainted with two professional killers for the organized crime syndicate in Chicago, David Yaras and Lenny Patrick. (25) The committee established that Ruby, Yaras and Patrick were in fact acquainted during Ruby's years in Chicago, particularly in the 1930's and 1940's.(26) Both Yaras and Patrick admitted, when questioned by the FBI in 1964, that they did know Ruby, but both said that they had not had any contact with him for 10 to 15 years. (27) Yaras and Patrick further maintained they had never been particularly close to Ruby, had never visited him in Dallas and had no knowledge of Ruby being connected to organized crime. (28) Indeed, the Warren Commission used Patrick's statement as a footnote citation in its report to support its conclusion that Ruby did not have significant syndicate associations. (29)\nOn the other hand, the committee established that Yaras and Patrick were, in fact, notorious gunmen, having been identified by law enforcement authorities as executioners for the Chicago mob(30) and closely associated with Sam Giancana, the organized crime leader in Chicago who was murdered in 1975. Yaras and Patrick are believed to have been responsible for numerous syndicate executions, including the murder of James Ragan, a gambling wire service owner. (31) The evidence implicating Yaras and Patrick in syndicate activities is unusually reliable.(32) Yaras, for example, was overheard in a 1969, electronic surveillance discussing various underworld murder con-\n1With reference to Guthrie's claim that Ruby's name had been mentioned frequently in the discussions with Chicago underworld representatives, the committee's review of the tape recordings failed to disclose such references. Portions of the tapes were unintelligible and two entire recordings were discovered by investigators in 1964 to be missing, so the evidence was not conclusive.\nPage 151\ntracts he had carried out and one he had only recently been assigned. While the committee found no evidence that Ruby was associated with Yaras or Patrick during the 50's or 1960's, (33) it concluded that Ruby had probably talked by telephone to Patrick during the summer of 1963. (34)\nWhile Ruby apparently did not participate in the organized crime move to Dallas is 1947, he did establish himself as a Dallas nightclub operator around that time. His first club was the Silver Spur, which featured country and western entertainment. Then he operated the Sovereign, a private club that failed and was converted into the Carousel Club, a burlesque house with striptease acts. Ruby, an extroverted individual, acquired numerous friends and contacts in and around Dallas, some of whom had syndicate ties.\nIncluded among Ruby's closest friends was Lewis McWillie. McWillie moved from Dallas to Cuba in 1958 and worked in gambling casinos in Havana until 1960.(35) In 1978, McWillie was employed in Las Vegas, and law enforcement files indicate he had business and personal ties to major organized crime figures, including Meyer Lansky and Santos Trafficante. (36)\nRuby traveled to Cuba on at least one occasion to visit McWillie. (37) McWillie testified to the committee that Ruby visited him only once in Cuba, and that it was a social visit.(38) The Warren Commission concluded this was the only trip Ruby took to Cuba,(39) despite documentation in the Commission's own files indicating Ruby made a second trip.\nBoth Ruby and McWillie claimed that Ruby's visit to Cuba was at McWillie's invitation and lasted about a week in the late summer or early fall of 1959. (41) The committee, however, obtained tourist cards from the Cuban Government that show Ruby entered Cuba on August 8, 1959, left on September 11, reentered on September 12 and left again on September 13, 1959.(42) These documents supplement records the committee obtained from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) indicating that Ruby left Cuba on September 11, 1959, traveling to Miami, returned to Cuba on September 12, and traveled on to New Orleans on September 13, 1959.(43) The Cuban Government could not state with certainty that the commercial airline flights indicated by the INS records were the only ones Ruby took during the period.(44)\nOther records obtained by the committee indicate that Ruby was in Dallas at times during the August 8 to September 11, 1959, period. (45) He apparently visited his safe deposit box on August 21, met with FBI Agent Charles W. Flynn on August 31,2 and returned to the safe deposit box on September 4. (47) Consequently, if the tourist card documentation, INS, FBI and bank records are all correct, Ruby had to have made at least three trips to Cuba. While the records appeared to be accurate, they were incomplete. The committee was unable to determine, for example, whether on the third trip, if it occurred, Ruby\n2In March 1959, Ruby told the FBI he wished to assist the Bureau by supplying on a confidential basis criminal information that had come to his attention. Between April and October 1959, Ruby met with Agent Flynn eight times and gave him a small bit of information about thefts and related offenses. On November 6, 1959, Flynn wrote that Ruby's information had not been particularly helpful, that further attempts to develop Ruby as a PCI (potential criminal informant) would be fruitless and that the file on Ruby should be closed (46).\nPage 152\ntraveled by commercial airline or some other means. Consequently, the committee could not rule out the possibility that Ruby made more trips during this period or at other times.\nBased on the unusual nature of the l-day trip to Miami from Havana on September 11-12 and the possibility of at least one additional trip to Cuba, the committee concluded that vacationing was probably not the purpose for traveling to Havana, despite Ruby's insistence to the Warren Commission that his one trip to Cuba in 1959 was a social visit. (48) The committee reached the judgment that Ruby most likely was serving as a courier for gambling interests when he traveled to Miami from Havana for 1 day, then returned to Cuba for a day, before flying to New Orleans.(49) This judgement is supported by the following:\nMcWillie had made previous trips to Miami on behalf of the owners of the Tropicana, the casino for which he worked, to deposit funds; (50)The committee also deemed it likely that Ruby at least met various organized crime figures in Cuba, possibly including some who had been detained by the Cuban government. (54) In fact, Ruby told the Warren Commission that he was later visited in Dallas by McWillie and a Havana casino owner and that they had discussed the gambling business in Cuba. 3(55)\nMcWillie placed a call to Meyer Panitz, a gambling associate in Miami, to inform him that Ruby was coming from Cuba, resulting in two meetings between Panitz and Ruby; (51)\nThere was a continuing need for Havana casino operators to send their assets out of Cuba to protect them from seizure by the Castro government; (52) and\nThe 1-day trip from Havana to Miami was not explained by Ruby, and his testimony to the Warren Commission about his travels to Cuba was contradictory.(53)\nAs noted by the Warren Commission, an exporter named Robert McKeown alleged that Ruby offered in 1959 to purchase a letter of introduction to Fidel Castro in hopes of securing the release of three individuals being held in a Cuban prison. (57) McKeown also claimed Ruby contacted him about a sale of jeeps to Cuba. 4(58) If McKeown's allegations were accurate, they would support a judgment that Ruby's travels to Cuba were not merely for a vacation. (The committee was unable to confirm or refute McKeown's allegations. In his appearance before the committee in executive session, however, McKeown's story did not seem to be credible, based on the committee's assessment of his demeanor.(61)\nIt has been charged that Ruby met with Santos Trafficante in Cuba sometime in 1959.(62) Trafficante, regarded as one of the Nation's most powerful organized crime figures, was to become a key participant in Castro assassination attempts by the Mafia and the CIA from 1960 to 1963.(63) The committee developed circumstantial evidence\n3Earlier, though both he and McWillie denied it, Ruby apparently sent a coded message to McWillie in Havana, containing various sets of numerals, a communication Ruby transmitted to McWillie via McWillie's girlfriend (56).\n4Ruby denied this to the Warren Commission, stating he did not have sufficient contacts to obtain jeeps at the time. (59) The Warren Commission noted that Ruby \"made preliminary inquiries, as a middleman\" in regard to the possible sale of jeeps in Cuba, but stated that he \"was merely pursuing a moneymaking opportunity.\"(60)\nPage 153\nthat makes a meeting between Ruby and Trafficante a distinct possibility,(64) but the evidence was not sufficient to form a final conclusion as to whether or not such a meeting took place.\nWhile allegations of a Ruby link to Trafficante had previously been raised, mainly due to McWillie's alleged close connections to the Mafia leader, it was not until recent years that they received serious attention. Trafficante had long been recognized by law enforcement officials as a leading member of the La Cosa Nostra, but he did not become the object of significant public attention in connection with the assassination of the President until his participation in the assassination plots against Castro was disclosed in 1975.\nIn 1976, in response to a freedom of information suit, the CIA declassified a State Department cablegram received from London on November 28, 1963. It read:\nOn 26 November 1963, a British Journalist named John Wilson, and also known as Wilson-Hudson, gave information to the American Embassy in London which indicated that an \"American gangster-type named Ruby\" visited Cuba around 1959. Wilson himself was working in Cuba at that time and was jailed by Castro before he was deported.Several days after the CIA had received the information, the Agency noted that there were reports that Wilson-Hudson was a \"psychopath\" and unreliable. The Agency did not conduct an investigation of the information, and the Warren Commission was apparently not informed of the cablegram. The former staff counsel who directed the Commission's somewhat limited investigation of organized crime told the committee that since the Commission was never told of the CIA's use of the Mafia to try to assassinate Castro from 1960 to 1963, he was not familiar with the name Santos Trafficante in 1964. (66)\nIn prison in Cuba, Wilson says he met an American gangster-gambler named Santos who could not return to the U.S.A. ...Instead he preferred to live in relative luxury in a Cuban prison. While Santos was in prison, Wilson says, Santos was visited frequently by an American gangster type named Ruby. (65)\nThe committee was unable to locate John Wilson-Hudson (According to reports, he had died.) Nor was the committee able to obtain independent confirmation of the Wilson-Hudson allegation. The committee was able, however, to develop corroborative information to the effect that Wilson-Hudson was incarcerated at the same detention camp in Cuba as Trafficante. (67)\nOn June 6, 1959, Trafficante and others who controlled extensive gambling interests in Cuba were detained as part of a Castro government policy that would subsequently lead to the confiscation of all underworld holding in Cuba.(68) They were held in Trescornia, a minimum security detention camp. (69) According to documentation supplied by the Cuban Government, Trafficante was released from Trescornia on August 18, 1959. (70) Tourist card documentation, also obtained by the committee, as well as various Warren Commission documents, indicate Ruby's first trip to Cuba began on August 1959.(71) Thus, Ruby was in Cuba during part of the final days of Trafficante's detention at Trescornia.(72)\nPage 154\nMcWillie testified before the committee that he had visited another detainee at Trescornia during that period, and he recalled possibly seeing Trafficante there. McWillie claimed, however, he did not say more than \"hello\" to him. (73) McWillie further testified it was during that period that Ruby visited him in Havana for about a week, and that Ruby tagged along with him during much of his stay. (74) McWillie told the committee that Ruby could have gone with him to visit Trescornia, although he doubted that Ruby did so.(75) McWillie testified that he could not clearly recall much about Ruby's visit. (76)\nJose Verdacia Verdacia, a witness made available for a committee interview by the Cuban Government, was the warden at Trescornia in August 1959.(77) Verdacia told the committee that he could not recall the name John Wilson-Hudson, but he could remember a British journalist who had worked in Argentina, as had Wilson-Hudson, who was detained at Trescornia. (78)\nIn his own public testimony before the committee, Trafficante testified that he did not remember Ruby ever having visited him at Trescornia. Trafficante stated,\nThere was no reason for this man to visit me. I have never seen this man before. I have never been to Dallas, I never had no contact with him. I don't see why he was going to come and visit me. (79)Trafficante did, however, testify that he could recall an individual fitting British journalist John Wilson-Hudson's description, and he stated that the man was among those who were held in his section at Trescornia. (80)\nThe importance of a Ruby-Trafficante meeting in Trescornia should not be overemphasized. The most it would show would be a meeting, at that a brief one. No one has suggested that President Kennedy's assassination was planned at Trescornia in 1959. At the same time, a meeting or an association, even minor, between Ruby and Trafficante would not have been necessary for Ruby to have been used by Trafficante to murder Oswald. (81) Indeed, it is likely that such a direct contact would have been avoided by Trafficante if there had been a plan to execute either the President or the President's assassin, but, since no such plot could have been under consideration in 1959, there would not have been a particular necessity for Trafficante-to avoid contact with Ruby in Cuba.\nThe committee investigated other aspects of Ruby's activities that might have shown an association with organized crime figures. An extensive computer analysis of his telephone toll records for the month prior to the President's assassination revealed that he either placed calls to or received calls from a number of individuals who may be fairly characterized as having been affiliated, directly or indirectly, with organized crime. (82) These included Irwin Weiner a Chicago bondsman well know as a frontman for organized crime and the Teamsters Union;(83) Robert \"Barney\" Baker, a lieutenant of James R. Hoffa and associate of several convicted organized crime executioners:(84) Nofio J. Pecora, a lieutenant of Carlos Marcello, the Mafia boss in Louisiana (85) Harold Tannenbaum, a New Orleans French Quarter nightclub manager who lived in a trailer park owned\nPage 155\nby Pecora;(86) McWillie, the Havana gambler;(87) and Murray \"Dusty\" Miller, a Teamster deputy of Hoffa and associate of various underworld figures.(88) Additionally, the committee concluded that Ruby was also probably in telephonic contact with Mafia executioner Lenny Patrick sometime during the summer of 1963. (89) Although no such call was indicated in the available Ruby telephone records, Ruby's sister, Eva Grant, told the Warren Commission that Ruby had spoken more than once of having contacted Patrick by telephone during that period. (90)\nThe committee found that the evidence surrounding the calls was generally consistent--at least to the times of their occurrence--with the explanation that they were for the purpose of seeking assistance in a labor dispute. (91) Ruby, as the operator of two nightclubs, the Carousel and the Vegas, had to deal with the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA), an entertainers union.(92) Ruby did in fact have a history of labor problems involving his striptease performers, and there was an ongoing dispute in the early 1960's regarding amateur performers in Dallas area nightclubs.(93) Testimony to the committee supported the conclusion that Ruby's phone calls were, by and large, related to his labor troubles. (94) In light of the identity of some of the individuals, however, the possibility of other matters being discussed could not be dismissed.(95)\nIn particular, the committee was not satisfied with the explanations of three individuals closely associated with organized crime who received telephone calls from Ruby in October or November 1963. (96)\nWeiner, the Chicago bondsman, refused to discuss his call from Ruby on October 26, 1963, with the FBI in 1964,(97) and he told a reporter in 1978 that the call had nothing to do with labor problems.(98) In his executive session testimony before the committee, however, Weiner stated that he had lied to the reporter, and he claimed that he and Ruby had, in fact discussed a labor dispute. (99) The committee was not satisfied with Weiner's explanation of his relationship with Ruby. Weiner suggested Ruby was seeking a bond necessary to obtain an injunction in his labor troubles, yet the committee could find no other creditable indication that Ruby contemplated seeking court relief, nor any other explanation for his having to go to Chicago for such a bond. (100)\nBarney Baker told the FBI in 1964 that he had received only one telephone call from Ruby (on Nov. 7, 1963) during which he had curtly dismissed Ruby's plea for assistance in a nightclub labor dispute.(101) The committee established, however, that Baker received a second lengthy call from Ruby on November 8.(102) The committee found it hard to believe that Baker, who denied the conversation ever took place, could have forgotten it. (103)\nThe committee was also dissatisfied with the explanation of a call Ruby made on October 30, 1963, to the New Orleans trailer park office of Nofio J. Pecora, the long-time Marcello lieutenant.(104) Pecora told the committee that only he would have answered his phone and that he never spoke with Ruby or took a message from him.(105) The committee considered the possibility that the call was actually for Harold Tannenbaum, a mutual friend of Ruby and\nPage 156\nPecora who lived in the trailer park, although Pecora denied he would have relayed such a message. (106)\nAdditionally, the committee found it difficult to dismiss certain Ruby associations with the explanation that they were solely related to his labor problems. For example, James Henry Dolan, a Dallas AGVA representative, was reportedly an acquaintance of both Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante.(107) While Dolan worked with Ruby on labor matters, they were also allegedly associated in other dealings, including a strong-arm attempt to appropriate the proceeds of a one-night performance of a stage review at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas called \"Bottoms Up.\" (108) The FBI, moreover, has identified Dolan as an associate of Nofio Pecora. (109) The committee noted further that reported links between AGVA and organized crime figures have been the subject of Federal and State investigations that have been underway for years.5(110) The committee's difficulties in separating Ruby's AGVA contacts from his organized crime connections was, in large degree, based on the dual roles that many of his associates played. 6\nIn assessing the significance of these Ruby contacts, the committee noted, first of all, that they should have been more thoroughly explored in 1964 when memories were clearer and related records (including, but not limited to, additional telephone toll records) were available. Further, while there may be persuasive arguments against the likelihood that the attack on Oswald would have been planned in advance on the telephone with an individual like Ruby, the pattern of contacts did show that individuals who had the motive to kill the President also had knowledge of a man who could be used to get access to Oswald in the custody of the Dallas police. In Ruby, they also had knowledge of a man who had exhibited a violent nature and who was in serious financial trouble. The calls, in short, established knowledge and possible availability, if not actual planning. (2) Ruby and the Dallas Police Department. The committee also investigated the relationship between Ruby and the Dallas Police Department to determine whether members of the department might have helped Ruby get access to Oswald for the purpose of shooting him.(111) Ruby had a friendly and somewhat unusual relationship with the Dallas Police Department, both collectively and with individual officers, but the committee found little evidence of any significant influence by Ruby within the force that permitted him to engage in illicit activities.(112) Nevertheless, Ruby's close relationship with one or more members of the police force may have been a factor in his entry to the police basement on November 24, 1963. (113)\nBoth the Warren Commission and a Dallas Police Department investigative unit concluded that Ruby entered the police basement on November 24, 1963, between 11:17 a.m., when he apparently sent a telegram, and 11:21, when he shot Oswald, via the building's Main Street ramp as a police vehicle was exiting, thereby fortuitously\n5According to FBI records, AGVA has been used frequently by members of organized crime as a front for criminal activities.\n6Although it was dissatisfied with the explanations it received for these calls, the committee also noted that the individuals called may have been reluctant to admit that Ruby was seeking their assistance in an illegal effort to settle his labor problems.\nPage 157\ncreating a momentary distraction.(114) The committee, however, found that Ruby probably did not come down the ramp,(115) and that his most likely route was an alleyway located next to the Dallas Municipal Building and a stairway leading to the basement garage of police headquarters. (116)\nThe conclusion reached by the Warren Commission that Ruby entered the police basement via the ramp was refuted by the eyewitness testimony of every witness in the relevant area only Ruby himself excepted. (117) It was also difficult for the committee to reconcile the ramp route with the 55-second interval (derived from viewings of the video tapes of the Oswald murder) from the moment the police vehicle started up the ramp and the moment Ruby shot Oswald. (118) Ruby would have had to come down the ramp after the vehicle went up, leaving him less than 55 seconds to get down the ramp and kill Oswald.\nEven though the Warren Commission and the Dallas police investigative unit were aware of substantial testimony contradicting the ramp theory, (119) they arrived at their respective conclusions by relying heavily on Ruby's own assertions and what they perceived to be the absence of a plausible alternative route. (120)\nThe committee's conclusion that Ruby entered from the alley was supported by the fact that it was much less conspicuous than the alternatives,(121) by the lack of security in the garage area and along the entire route,(122) and by the testimony concerning the security of the doors along the alley and stairway route. (123) This route would also have accommodated the 4-minute interval from Ruby's departure from a Western Union office near police headquarters at 11:17 a.m. to the moment of the shooting at 11:21.(124)\nBased on a review of the evidence, albeit circumstantial, the committee believed that Ruby's shooting of Oswald was not a spontaneous act, in that it involved at least some premeditation.(125) Similarly, the Committee believed that it was less likely that Ruby entered the police basement without assistance, even though the assistance may have been provided with no knowledge of Ruby's intentions. The assistance may have been in the form of information about plans for Oswald's transfer or aid in entering the building or both.7(126)\nThe committee found several circumstances significant in its evaluation of Ruby's conduct. It considered in particular the selectively recalled and self-serving statements in Ruby's narration of the events of the entire November 22-24 weekend in arriving at its conclusions. (127) It also considered certain conditions and events. The committee was troubled by the apparently unlocked doors along the stairway route and the removal of security guards from the area of the garage nearest the stairway shortly before the shooting;(128) by a Saturday night telephone call from Ruby to his closest friend, Ralph Paul, in which Paul responded to something Ruby said by asking him if he was crazy;(129) and by the actions and statements of several Dallas police officers, particularly those present when Ruby was initially interrogated about the shooting of Oswald. (130)\n7While the Warren Commission did not make reference to it in its report, Ruby refused in his first interviews with the FBI, Secret Service and the Dallas police to indicate how he entered the basement or whether anyone had assisted him. In later interviews, Ruby state he had walked down the ramp.\nPage 158\nThere is also evidence that the Dallas Police Department withheld relevant information from the Warren Commission concerning Ruby's entry to the scene of the Oswald transfer.(131) For example, the fact that a polygraph test had been given to Sergeant Patrick Dean in 1964 was never revealed to the Commission, even though Dean was responsible for basement security and was the first person to whom Ruby explained how he had entered the basement.(132) Dean indicated to the committee that he had \"failed\" the test, but the committee was unable to locate a copy of the actual questions, responses and results. (133)\nTop of Page\n(3) Other evidence relating to Ruby.---The committee noted that other Ruby activities and movements during the period immediately following the assassination--on November 22 and 23--raised disturbing questions. For example, Ruby's first encounter with Oswald occurred over 36 hours before he shot him. Ruby was standing within a few feet of Oswald as he was being moved from one part of police headquarters to another just before midnight on November 22.(134) Ruby testified that he had no trouble entering the building, and the committee found no evidence contradicting his story. The committee was disturbed, however, by Ruby's easy access to headquarters and by his inconsistent accounts of his carrying a pistol. In an FBI interview on December 25, 1963, he said he had the pistol during the encounter with Oswald late in the evening of November 22. But when questioned about it by the Warren Commission, Ruby replied, \"I will be honest with you. I lied about it. It isn't so, I didn't have a gun.\" (135) Finally, the committee was troubled by reported sightings of Ruby on Saturday, November 23, at Dallas police headquarters and at the county jail at a time when Oswald's transfer to the county facility had originally been scheduled. These sightings, along with the one on Friday night, could indicate that Ruby was pursuing Oswald's movements throughout the weekend.\nThe committee also questioned Ruby's self-professed motive for killing Oswald, his story to the Warren Commission and other authorities that he did it out of sorrow over the assassination and sympathy for the President's widow and children. Ruby consistently claimed there had been no other motive and that no one had influenced his act. (136) A handwritten note by Ruby, disclosed in 1967, however, exposed Ruby's explanation for the Oswald slaying as a fabricated legal ploy. (137) Addressed to his attorney, Joseph Tonahill, it told of advice Ruby had received from his first lawyer. Tom Howard, in 1963: \"Joe, you should know this. Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn't have to come to Dallas to testify. OK?\" (138)\nThe committee examined a report that Ruby was at Parkland Hospital shortly after the fatally wounded President had been brought there on November 22, 1963. Seth Kantor, a newsman then employed by Scripps-Howard who had known Ruby, later testified to the Warren Commission that he had run into him at Parkland and spoken with him briefly shortly before the President's death was announced. (139) While the Warren Commission concluded that Kantor was mistaken.(14O) the committee determined he probably was not. The committee was impressed by the opinion of Burr W. Griffin, the\nPage 159\nWarren Commission counsel who directed the Ruby investigation and wrote the Ruby section of the Warren report. Griffin told the committee he had come to believe, in light of evidence subsequently brought out, that the Commission conclusion about Kantor's testimony was wrong.(141)\nSubsequent to Ruby's apprehension, he was given a polygraph examination by the FBI in which he denied that he had been involved with any other person in killing Oswald, or had been involved in any way in the assassination of President Kennedy.(142) The Warren Commission stated it did not rely on this examination in drawing conclusions, although it did publish a transcript of the examination.(143) The FBI in 1964 also expressed dissatisfaction with the test,(144) based on the circumstances surrounding its administration. A panel of polygraph experts reviewed the examination for the committee and concluded that it was not validly conducted or interfered.(145) Because there were numerous procedural errors made during the test, the committee's panel was unable to interpret the examination.(146)\nFinally, the committee analyzed the finances of Ruby and of his family to determine if there was any evidence of financial profit from his killing of the accused assassins.(147) It was an analysis the Warren Commission could not perform so soon after the assassination. (148) Some financial records, including tax returns, could not be legally obtained by the committee without great difficulty, and others no longer existed. (149) Nevertheless, on the basis of the information that it did obtain, the committee uncovered no evidence that Ruby or members of his family profited from the killing of Oswald. (150) Particular allegations concerning the increased business and personal incomes of Ruby's brother Earl were investigated, but the committee found no link between Earl Ruby's finances and the Oswald slaying. (151) Earl Ruby did say he had been approached by the Chicago bondsman and associate of organized crime figures, Irwin Weiner, who made a business proposition to him in 1978. the day before Earl Ruby was to testify before the committee. (152) Earl Ruby said he declined the offer,(153) while Weiner denied to the committee he ever made it. (154) The committee was not able to resolve the difference between the two witnesses.\nTop of Page\n(4) Involvement of organized crime.---In contrast to the Warren Commission, the committee's investigation of the possible involvement of organized crime in the assassination was not limited to an examination of Jack Ruby. The committee also directed its attention to organized crime itself.\nOrganized crime is a term of many meanings. It can be used to refer to the crimes committed by organized criminal groups--gambling, narcotics, loan-sharking, theft and fencing, and the like.(155) It can also be used to refer to the criminal group that commit those crimes. (156) Here, a distinction may be drawn between an organized crime enterprise that engages in providing illicit goods and services and an organized crime syndicate that regulates relations between individual enterprises--allocating territory, settling personal disputes, establishing gambling payoffs, etc. (157) Syndicates, too, are of different types. They may be metropolitan, regional, national or interna-\nPage 160\ntional in scope; they may be limited to one field of endeavor--for example, narcotics- or they may cover a broad range of illicit activities. (158).\nOften, but not always, the term organized crime refers to a particular organized crime syndicate, variously known as the Mafia or La Cosa Nostra,(159) and it is in this sense that the committee has used the phrase. This organized crime syndicate was the principal target of the committee investigation. (160)\nThe committee found that by 1964 the fundamental structure and operations of organized crime in America had changed little since the early 1950's, when, after conducting what was then the most extensive investigation of organized crime in history, the Kefauver committee concluded:\n1. There is a nationwide crime syndicate known as the Mafia, whose tentacles are found in many large cities. It has international ramifications which appear most clearly in connection with the narcotics traffic.The committee reviewed the evolution of the national crime syndicate in the years after the Kefauver committee and found continuing vitality, even more sophisticated techniques, and an increased concern for the awareness by law enforcement authorities of the danger it posed to the Nation. (162) In 1967, after having conducted a lengthy examination of organized crime in the United States, the President's Crime Commission offered another description of the power and influence of the American underworld in the 1960's:\n2. Its leaders are usually found in control of the most lucrative rackets in their cities.\n3. There are indications of a centralized direction and control of these rackets, but leadership appears to be in a group rather than in a single individual.\n4. The Mafia is the cement that helps to bind the ...syndicate of New York and the ...syndicate of Chicago as well as smaller criminal gangs and individual criminals through the country.\n5. The domination of the Mafia is based fundamentally on \"muscle\" and \"murder.\" The Mafia is a secret conspiracy against law and order which will ruthlessly eliminate anyone who stands in the way of its success in any criminal enterprise in which it is interested. It will destroy anyone who betrays its secrets. It will use any means available--political influence, bribery, intimidation, et cetera, to defeat any attempt on the part of law enforcement to touch its top figures.... (161)\nOrganized crime is a society that seeks to operate outside the control of the American people and their governments. It involves thousands of criminals, working within structures as complex as those of any large corporation, subject to laws more rigidly enforced than those of legitimate governments. Its actions are not impulsive but rather the result of intricate conspiracies, carried on over many years and aimed at gaining control over whole fields of activity in order to amass huge profits.(163)Page 161\nAn analysis by the committee revealed that the Kennedy administration brought about the strongest effort against organized crime that had ever been coordinated by the Federal Government.(164) John and Robert Kennedy brought to their respective positions as President and Attorney General an unprecedented familiarity with the threat of organized crime--and a commitment to prosecute its leaders-- based on their service as member and chief counsel respectively of the McClellan Committee during its extensive investigation of labor racketeering in the late 1950's. (165) A review of the electronic surveillance conducted by the FBI from 1961 to 1964 demonstrated that members of La Cosa Nostra, as well as other organized crime figures, were quite cognizant of the stepped-up effort against them, and they placed responsibility for it directly upon President Kennedy and Attorney General Kennedy. (166)\nDuring this period, the FBI had comprehensive electronic coverage of the major underworld figures, particularly those who comprised the commission. 8(167) The committee had access to and analyzed the product of this electronic coverage; it reviewed literally thousands of pages of electronic surveillance logs that revealed the innermost workings of organized crime in the United States. (168) The committee saw in stark terms a record of murder, violence, bribery, corruption, and an untold variety of other crimes. (169) Uniquely among congressional committees, and in contrast to the Warren Commission, the committee became familiar with the nature and scope of organized crime in the years before and after the Kennedy assassination, using as its evidence the words of the participants themselves.\nAn analysis of the work of the Justice Department before and after the tenure of Robert Kennedy as Attorney General also led to the conclusion that organized crime directly benefited substantially from the changes in Government policy that occurred after the assassination. (170) That organized crime had the motive, opportunity and means to kill the President cannot be questioned. (171) Whether it did so is another matter.\nIn its investigation of the decisionmaking process and dynamics of organized crime murders and intrasyndicate assassinations during the early 1960's. the committee noted the extraordinary web of insulation, secrecy, and complex machinations that frequently surrounded organized crime leaders who ordered such acts.(172) In testimony before the Senate on September 25, 1963, 2 months before his brother's assassination, Attorney General Kennedy spoke of the Government's continuing difficulty in solving murders carried out by organized crime elements, particularly those ordered by members of the La Cosa Nostra commission. Attorney General Kennedy testified that:\n...because the members of the Commission, the top members, or even their chief lieutenants, have insulated themselves from the crime itself, if they want to have somebody knocked off, for instance, the top man will speak to somebody who will speak to somebody else who will speak to somebody else and order it. The man who actually does the gun work, who might8The ruling council of 9 to 12 Mafia leaders who collectively rule the national crime syndicate\nPage 162\nget paid $250 or $500, depending on how important it is, perhaps nothing at all he does not know who ordered it. To trace that back is virtually impossible. (173)The committee studied the Kennedy assassination in terms of the traditional forms of violence used by organized crime and the historic pattern of underworld slayings. While the murder of the President's accused assassin did in fact fit the traditional pattern--a shadowy man with demonstrable organized crime connections shoots down a crucial witness--the method of the President's assassination did not resemble the standard syndicate killing.(174) A person like Oswald-young, active in controversial political causes, apparently not subject to the internal discipline of a criminal organization--would appear to be the least likely candidate for the role of Mafia hit man, especially in such an important murder. Gunmen used in organized crime killings have traditionally been selected with utmost deliberation and care, the most important considerations being loyalty and a willingness to remain silent if apprehended. These are qualities best guaranteed by past participation in criminal activities. (175)\nThere are, however, other factors to be weighed in evaluating the method of possible operation in the assassination of President Kennedy. While the involvement of a gunman like Oswald does not readily suggest organized crime involvement, any underworld attempt to assassinate the President would in all likelihood have dictated the use of some kind of cover, a shielding or disguise. (176) The committee made the reasonable assumption that an assassination of a President by organized crime could not be allowed to appear to be what it was.\nTraditional organized crime murders are generally committed through the use of killers who make no effort to hide the fact that organized crime was responsible for such murders or \"hits.\"(177) While syndicate-authorized hits are usually executed in such a way that identification of the killers is not at all likely, the slayings are nonetheless committed in what is commonly referred to as the \"gangland style.\"(178) Indeed, an intrinsic characteristic of the typical mob execution is that it serves as a self-apparent message, with the authorities and the public readily perceiving the nature of the crime as well as the general identity of the group or gang that carried it out.(179)\nThe execution of a political leader--most particularly a President would hardly be a typical mob execution and might well necessitate a different method of operation. The overriding consideration in such an extraordinary crime would be the avoidance of any appearance of organized crime complicity. (180)\nIn its investigation, the committee noted three cases, for the purposes of illustration, in which the methodology employed by syndicate figures was designed to insulate and disguise the involvement of organized crime. (181) These did not fit the typical pattern of mob killings, as the assassination of a President would not. (182) While the a typical cases did not involve political leaders, two of the three were attacks on figures in the public eye. (183)\nIn the first case, the acid blinding of investigative reporter Victor Riesel in April 1956, organized crime figures in New York used a complex series of go-betweens to hire a petty thief and burglar to\nPage 163\ncommit the act. (184) Thus, the assailant did not know who had actually authorized the crime for which he had been recruited. (185) The use of such an individual was regarded as unprecedented, as he had not been associated with the syndicate, was a known drug user, and outwardly appeared to be unreliable.(186) Weeks later, Riesel's assailant was slain by individuals who had recruited him in the plot. (187)\nThe second case, the fatal shooting of a well-known businessman, Sol Landie, in Kansas City, Mo., on November 22, 1970, involved the recruitment, through several intermediaries, of four young Black men by members of the local La Cosa Nostra family.(188) Landie had served as a witness in a Federal investigation of gambling activities directed by Kansas City organized crime leader Nicholas Civella. The men recruited for the murder did not know who had ultimately ordered the killing, were not part of the Kansas City syndicate, and had received instructions through intermediaries to make it appear that robbery was the motive for the murder. (189) All of the assailants and two of the intermediaries were ultimately convicted.\nThe third case, the shooting of New York underworld leader Joseph Columbo before a crowd of 65,000 people in June 1971, was carried out by a young Black man with a petty criminal record, a nondescript loner who appeared to be alien to the organized crime group that had recruited him through various go-betweens.(190) The gunman was shot to death immediately after the shooting of Columbo, a murder still designated as unsolved. (191) (Seriously wounded by a shot to the head, Columbo lingered for years in a semiconscious state before he died in 1978.)\nThe committee found that these three cases, each of which is an exception to the general rule of organized crime executions, had identifiable similarities.(192) Each case was solved, in that the identity of the perpetrator of the immediate act became known. (193) In two of the cases, the assailant was himself murdered soon after the crime.(194) In each case, the person who wanted the crime accomplished recruited the person or persons who made the attack through more than one intermediary.(195) In each case, the person suspected of inspiring the violence was a member of, or connected to, La Cosa Nostra. (196) In each case, the person or persons hired were not professional killers, and they were not part of organized criminal groups. (197) In each case, the persons recruited to carry out the acts could be characterized as dupes or tools who were being used in a conspiracy they were not fully aware of. (198) In each case, the intent was to insulate the organized crime connection, with a particular requirement for disguising the true identity of the conspirators, and to place the blame on generally nondescript individuals. (199) These exceptions to the general rule of organized crime violence made it impossible for the committee to preclude, on the basis of an analysis of the method of the assassination, that President Kennedy was killed by elements of organized crime. (200)\nIn its investigation into the possibility that organized crime elements were involved in the President's murder, the committee examined various internal and external factor that bear on whether organized crime leaders would have considered, planned and executed an assas-\nPage 164\nsination conspiracy. (201) The committee examined the decisionmaking process that would have been involved in such a conspiracy, and two primary propositions emerged. (202) The first related to whether the national crime syndicate would have authorized and formulated a conspiracy with the formal consent of the commission, the ruling council of Mafia leaders. (203) The second related to whether an individual organized crime leader, or possibly a small combination of leaders, might have conspired to assassinate the President through unilateral action, that is, without the involvement of the leadership of the national syndicate. (204)\nThe most significant evidence that organized crime as an institution or group was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy was contained in the electronic surveillance of syndicate leaders conducted by the FBI in the early 1960's. (205) As the President's Crime Commission noted in 1967, and as this committee found through its review of the FBI surveillance, there was a distinct hierarchy and structure to organized crime. (206) Decisions of national importance were generally made by the national commission, or at least they depended on the approval of the commission members. (207) In 1963, the following syndicate leaders served as members of the commission: Vito Genovese, Joseph Bonanno, Carlo Gambino, and Thomas Lucchese of New York City; Stefano Magaddino of Buffalo; Sam Giancana of Chicago; Joseph Zerilli of Detroit; Angelo Bruno of Philadelphia and Raymond Patriarca of Providence. (208) The committee's review of the surveillance transcripts and logs, detailing the private conversations of the commission members and their associates, revealed that there were extensive and heated discussions about the serious difficulties the Kennedy administration's crackdown on organized crime was causing. (209)\nThe bitterness and anger with which organized crime leaders viewed the Kennedy administration are readily apparent in the electronic surveillance transcripts, with such remarks being repeatedly made by commission members Genovese, Giancana, Bruno, Zerilli, Patriarca and Magaddino.(210) In one such conversation in May 1962, a New York Mafia member noted the intense Federal pressure upon the mob, and remarked, \"Bob Kennedy won't stop today until he puts us all in jail all over the country. Until the commission meets and puts its foot down, things will be at a standstill.\"(211) Into 1963, the pressure was continuing to mount, as evidenced by a conversation in which commission member Magaddino bitterly cursed Attorney General Kennedy and commented on the Justice Department's increasing knowledge of the crime syndicates inner workings, stating, \"They know everything under the sun. They know who's back of it--they know there is a commission. We got to watch right now--and stay as quiet as possible.\" (212)\nWhile the committee's examination of the electronic surveillance program revealed no shortage of such conversations during that period, the committee found no evidence in the conversations of the formulation of any specific plan to assassinate the President. (213) Nevertheless, that organized crime figures did discuss possible violent courses of action against either the President or his brother, Attorney Gen-\nPage 165\neral Robert F. Kennedy--as well as the possible repercussions of such action-can be starkly seen in the transcripts.(214)\nOne such discussion bears quoting at length. It is a conversation between commission member Angelo Bruno of Philadelphia and an associate Willie Weisburg, on February 8, 1962. (215) In the discussion, in response to Weisburg's heated suggestion that Attorney General Kennedy should be murdered, Bruno cautioned that Kennedy might be followed by an even worse Attorney General:\nWEISBURG. See what Kennedy done. With Kennedy, a guy should take a knife, like all them other guys, and stab and kill the [obscenity], where he is now. Somebody should kill the [obscenity], I mean it. This is true. Honest to God. It's about time to go. But I tell you something. I hope I git a week's notice, I'll kill. Right in the [obscenity] in the White House. Somebody's got to rid of this [obscenity].While Angelo Bruno had hoped to wait out his troubles, believing that things might get better for him as time went by, such was not to be the case during the Kennedy administration. The electronic surveillance transcripts disclosed that by mid 1963, Bruno was privately making plans to shut down his syndicate operations and leave America, an unprecedented response by a commission member to Federal law enforcement pressure.(217)\nBRUNO. Look, Willie, do you see there was a king, do you understand. And he found out that everybody was saying that he was a bad king. This is an old Italian story. So, he figured. Let me go talk to the old woman. She knows everything. So he went to the old wise woman. So he says to her: \"I came here because I want your opinion.\" He says: \"Do you think I'm a bad king? She says: \"No, I think you are a good king.\" He says: \"Well how can everybody says I'm a bad king?\" She says: \"Because they are stupid. They don't know.\" He says: Well how come, why do you say I'm a good king?\" \"Well,\" she said, \"I knew your great grandfather. He was a bad king. I knew your grandfather. He was worse. I knew your father. He was worse than them. You, you are worse than them, but your son, if you die, your son is going to be worse than you. So its better to be with you.\" [All laugh.] So Brownell--former Attorney General--was bad. He was no [obscenity] good. He was this and that.\nWEISBURG. Do you know what this man is going to do? He ain't going to leave nobody alone.\nBRUNO. I know he ain't. But you see, everybody in there was bad. The other guy was good because the other guy was worse. Do you understand? Brownell came. He was no good. He was worse than the guy before.\nWEISBURG. Not like this one.\nBRUNO. Not like this one. This one is worse. right? If something happens to this guy...[laughs]. (216)\nAnother member of the mob commission, Stefano Magaddino, voiced similar anger toward the President during that same period. (218) In October 1963, in response to a Mafia family member's\nPage 166\nremark that President Kennedy \"should drop dead,\" Magaddino exploded, \"They should kill the whole family, the mother and father too. When he talks he talks like a mad dog, he says, my brother the Attorney General.\" (219)\nThe committee concluded that had the national crime syndicate, as a group, been involved in a conspiracy to kill the President, some trace of the plot would have been picked up by the FBI surveillance of the commission. (220) Consequently, finding no evidence in the electronic surveillance transcripts of a specific intention or actual plan by commission members to have the President assassinated, the committee believed it was unlikely that it existed. The electronic surveillance transcripts included extensive conversations during secret meetings of various syndicate leaders, set forth many of their most closely guarded thoughts and actions, and detailed their involvement in a variety of other criminal acts, including murder.(221) Given the far-reaching possible consequences of an assassination plot by the commission, the committee found that such a conspiracy would have been the subject of serious discussion by members of the commission, and that no matter how guarded such discussions might have been, some trace of them would have emerged from the surveillance coverage. (222) It was possible to conclude, therefore, that it is unlikely that the national crime syndicate as a group, acting under the leadership of the commission, participated in the assassination of President Kennedy.(223)\nWhile there was an absence of evidence in the electronic surveillance materials of commission participation in the President's murder, there was no shortage of evidence of the elation and relief of various commission members over his death.(224) The surveillance transcripts contain numerous crude and obscene comments by organized crime leaders, their lieutenants, associates and families regarding the assassination of President Kennedy.(225) The transcripts also reveal an awareness by some mob leaders that the authorities might be watching their reactions. (226) On November 25, 1963, in response to a lieutenant's remark that Oswald \"was an anarchist ...a Marxist Communist,\" Giancana exclaimed, \"He was a marksman who knew how to shoot.\"(227) On November 29, 1963, Magaddino cautioned his associates not to joke openly about the President's murder, stating, \"You can be sure that the police spies will be watching carefully to see what we think and say about this.\" (228) Several weeks later, during a discussion between Bruno and his lieutenants, one participant remarked of the late President, \"It is too bad his brother Bobby was not in that car too.\"(229)\nWhile the committee found it unlikely that the national crime syndicate was involved in the assassination, it recognized the possibility that a particular organized crime leader or a small combination of leaders, acting unilaterally, might have formulated an assassination conspiracy without the consent of the commission. (230)\nIn its investigation of the national crime syndicate, the committee noted factors that could have led an organized crime leader who was considering an assassination to withhold it from the national commission.(231) The committee's analysis of the national commission disclosed that it was splintered by dissension and enmity in 1963. Rivalry between two blocks of syndicate families had resulted in a partial paralysis of the commission's functions. (232)\nPage 167\nOne significant reason for the disarray was, of course, the pressure being exerted by Federal law enforcement agencies. (233) In the fall of 1963, Attorney General Kennedy noted,\n...in the past 2 years, at least three carefully planned commission meetings had to be called off because the leaders learned that we had uncovered their well-concealed plans and meeting places.The Government's effort got an unprecedented boost from the willingness of Joseph Valachi, a member of the \"family\" of commission member Vito Genovese of New York, to testify about the internal structure and activities of the crime syndicate, a development described by Attorney General Kennedy as \"the greatest intelligence breakthrough\" in the history of the Federal program against organized crime. (234) While it was not until August 1963 that Valachi's identity as a Federal witness became public, the surveillance transcripts disclose that syndicate leaders were aware as early as the spring of 1963 that Valachi was cooperating with the Justice Department.(235) The transcripts disclose that the discovery that Valachi had become a Federal informant aroused widespread suspicion fear over the possibility of other leaks and informants within the upper echelons of the syndicate. (236) The televised Senate testimony by Valachi led to considerable doubt by syndicate leaders in other parts of the country as to the security of commission proceedings, with Genovese rapidly losing influence as a result of Valachi's actions. (237)\nThe greatest source of internal disruption within the commission related to the discovery in early 1963 of a secret plan by commission member Joseph Bonanno to assassinate fellow members Carlo Gambino and Thomas Lucchese. (238) Bonanno's assassination plan, aimed at an eventual takeover of the commission leadership, was discovered after one of the gunmen Bonanno had enlisted, Joseph Columbo, informed on him to the commission. (239) The Bonanno conspiracy, an unheard-of violation of commission rules, led to a long series of acrimonious deliberations that lasted until early 1964. (240) Bonanno refused to submit to the judgment of the commission, and his colleagues were sharply divided over how to deal with his betrayal, Gambino recommending that Bonanno be handled with caution, and Giancana urging that he be murdered.(241)\nThe committee concluded, based on the state of disruption within the commission and the questions that had arisen as to the sanctity of commission proceedings, that an individual organized crime leader who was planning an assassination conspiracy against President Kennedy might well have avoided making the plan known to the commission or seeking approval for it from commission members. (242) Such a course of unilateral action seemed to the committee to have been particularly possible in the case of powerful organized crime leaders who were well established, with firm control over their jurisdictions.(243)\nThe committee noted a significant precedent for such a unilateral course of action. In 1957, Vito Genovese engineered the assassination of Albert Anastasia, then perhaps the most feared Mafia boss in the country. (244) Six months earlier, Genovese's men had shot and wounded Frank Costello, who once was regarded as the single most influential\nPage 168\norganized crime leader.(245) Both the Anastasia assassination and the Costello assault were carried out without the knowledge or consent of the national commission.(246) Genovese did, however, obtain approval for the crimes after the fact. (247) It was an extraordinary sequence of events that Attorney General Kennedy noted in September 1963, when he stated that Genovese \"...wanted Commission approval for these acts--which he has received.\" The Genovese plot against Anastasia and Costello and the ex post facto commission approval were integral events in the rise to dominance of organized crime figures for the years that followed. It directly led to the assemblage of national syndicate leaders at the Apalachin conference 3 weeks after the Anastasia murder, and to the rise of Carlo Gambino to a position of preeminence in La Costa Nostra. (248)\nTop of Page\n(5) Analysis of the 1963-64 investigation--In its investigation, the committee learned that fears of the possibility that organized crime was behind the assassination were more common among Government officials at the time than has been generally recognized. Both Attorney General Kennedy and President Johnson privately voiced suspicion about underworld complicity.(249) The Attorney General requested that any relevant information be forwarded directly to him, and there was expectation at the time that the recently created Warren Commission would actively investigate the possibility of underworld involvement. (250)\nThe committee found, however, that the Warren Commission conducted only a limited pursuit of the possibility of organized crime complicity. (251) As has been noted, moreover, the Warren Commission's interest in organized crime was directed exclusively at Jack Ruby, and it did not involve any investigation of the national crime syndicate in general, or individual leaders in particular.(252) This was confirmed to the committee by J. Lee Rankin, the Commission's general counsel, and by Burt W. Griffin, the staff counsel who conducted the Ruby investigation. (253) Griffin testified before the committee that \"...the possibility that someone associated with the underworld would have wanted to assassinate the President... [was] not seriously explored\" by the Warren Commission. (254)\nThe committee similarly learned from testimony and documentation that the FBI's investigation of the President's assassination was also severely limited in the area of possible organized crime involvement. While the committee found that the Bureau was uniquely equipped, with the Special Investigative Division having been formed 2 years earlier specifically to investigate organized crime, the specialists and agents of that Division did not play a significant role in the assassination investigation. (255) Former Assistant FBI Director Courtney Evans, who headed the Special Investigative Division, told the committee that the officials who directed the investigation never consulted him or asked for any participation by his Division.(256) Evans recalled, \"I know they sure didn't come to me. We had no part in that that I can recall.\" (257) Al Staffeld, a former FBI official who supervised the day-to-day operations of the Special Investigative Division, told the committee that if the FBI's organized crime specialists had been asked to participate, \"We would have gone at it in every damn way possible.\"(258)\nPage 169\nIronically, the Bureau's own electronic surveillance transcripts revealed to the committee a conversation between Sam Giancana and a lieutenant, Charles English, regarding the FBI's role in investigating President Kennedy's assassination. (259). In the December 3, 1963 conversation, English told Giancana:\"I will tell you something, in another 2 months from now, the FBI will be like it was 5 years ago. They won't be around no more. They say the FBI will get it (the investigation of the President's assassination). They're gonna start running down Fair Play for Cuba, Fair Play for Matsu. They call that more detrimental to the country than us guys.\"(260)\nThe committee found that the quality and scope of the investigation into the possibility of an organized crime conspiracy in the President's assassination by the Warren Commission and the FBI was not sufficient to uncover one had it existed. The committee also found that it was possible, based on an analysis of motive, means and opportunity, that an individual organized crime leader, or a small combination of leaders, might have participated in a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. The committee's extensive investigation led it to conclude that the most likely family bosses of organized crime to have participated in such a unilateral assassination plan were Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante. (261) While other family bosses on the commission were subjected to considerable coverage in the electronic surveillance program, such coverage was never applied to Marcello and almost never to Trafficante. (262)\nTop of Page\n(6) Carlos Marcello.--The committee found that Marcello had the motive, means and opportunity to have President John F. Kennedy assassinated, (263) though it was unable to establish direct evidence of Marcello's complicity.\nIn its investigation of Marcello, the committee identified the presence of one critical evidentiary element that was lacking with the other organized crime figures examined by the committee: credible associations relating both Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby to figures having a relationship, albeit tenuous, with Marcello's crime family or organization. (264) At the same time, the committee explicitly cautioned: association is the first step in conspiracy; it is not identical to it, and while associations may legitimately give rise to suspicions, a careful distinction must always be drawn between suspicions suspected and facts found.\nAs the long-time La Cosa Nostra leader in an area that is based in New Orleans but extends throughout Louisiana and Texas, Marcello was one of the prime targets of Justice Department efforts during the Kennedy administration.(265) He had, in fact, been temporarily removed from the country for a time in 1961 through deportation proceedings personally expedited by Attorney General Kennedy. (266) In his appearance before the committee in executive session, Marcello exhibited an intense dislike for Robert Kennedy because of these actions, claiming that he had been illegally \"kidnaped\"by Government agents during the deportation. (267)\nWhile the Warren Commission devoted extensive attention to Oswald's background and activities, the committee uncovered significant details of his exposure to and contacts with figures associated\nPage 170\nwith the underworld of New Orleans that apparently had escaped the Commission.(268) One Such relationship actually extended into Oswald's own family through his uncle, Charles \"Dutz\" Murret, a minor underworld gambling figure.(269) The committee discovered that Murret, who served as a surrogate father of sorts throughout much of Oswald's life in New Orleans, was in the 1940's and 1950's and possibly until his death in 1964: an associate of significant organized crime figures affiliated with the Marcello organization. (270)\nThe committee established that Oswald was familiar with his uncle's underworld activities and had discussed them with his wife, Marina, in 1963.(271) Additionally, the committee found that Oswald's mother, Marguerite Oswald, was acquainted with several men associated with lieutenants in the Marcello organization. One such acquaintance, who was also an associate of Dutz Murret, reportedly served as a personal aide or driver to Marcello at one time. (272) In another instance, the committee found that an individual connected to Dutz Murret, the person who arranged bail for Oswald following his arrest in August 1963 for a street disturbance, was an associate of two of Marcello's syndicate deputies. (One of the two, Nofio Pecora, as noted, also received a telephone call from Ruby on October 30, 1963, according to the committee's computer analysis of Ruby's phone records.) (273)\nDuring the course of its investigation, the committee developed several areas of credible evidence and testimony indicating a possible association in New Orleans and elsewhere between Lee Harvey Oswald and David W. Ferrie, a private investigator and even, perhaps, a pilot for Marcello before and during 1963.(274) From the evidence available to the committee, the nature of the Oswald-Ferrie association remained largely a mystery. The committee established that Oswald and Ferrie apparently first came into contact with each other during Oswald's participation as a teenager in a Civil Air Patrol unit for which Ferrie served as an instructor, although Ferrie, when he was interviewed by the FBI after his detainment as a suspect in the assassination,(275) denied any past association with Oswald.\nIn interviews following the assassination, Ferrie stated that he may have spoken in an offhand manner of the desirability of having President Kennedy shot, but he denied wanting such a deed actually to be done.(276) Ferrie also admitted his association with Marcello and stated that he had been in personal contact with the syndicate leader in the fall of 1963. He noted that on the morning of the day of the President's death he was present with Marcello at a courthouse in New Orleans. (277) In his executive session testimony before the committee, Marcello acknowledged that Ferrie did work for his lawyer, G. Wray Gill, on his case, but Marcello denied that Ferrie worked for him or that their relationship was close. (278) Ferrie died in 1967 of a ruptured blood vessel at the base of the brain, shortly after he was named in the assassination investigation of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison.\nThe committee also confirmed that the address 544 Camp Street, that Oswald had printed on some Fair Play for Cuba Committee handouts in New Orleans, was the address of a small office building\nPage 171\nwhere Ferrie was working on at least a part-time basis in 1963. The Warren Commission stated in its report that despite the Commission's probe into why Oswald used this return address on his literature, \"investigation has indicated that neither the Fair Play for Cuba Committee nor Lee Oswald ever maintained an office at that address.\" (280)\nThe committee also established associations between Jack Ruby and several individuals affiliated with the underworld activities of Carlos Marcello. (281) Ruby was a personal acquaintance of Joseph Civello, the Marcello associate, who allegedly headed organized crime activities in Dallas; he also knew other individuals who have been linked with organized crime, including a New Orleans nightclub figure, Harold Tannenbaum, with whom Ruby was considering going into partnership in the fall of 1963. (282) 9\nThe committee examined a widely circulated published account that Marcello made some kind of threat on the life of President Kennedy in September 1962 at a meeting at his Churchill Farms estate outside New Orleans.(284) It was alleged that Marcello shouted an old Sicilian threat, \"Livarsi na petra di la scarpa!\" \"Take the stone out of my shoe!\" against the Kennedy brothers, stating that the President ways going to be assassinated. He spoke of using a \"nut\" to carry out the murder. (285)\nThe committee established the origin of the story and identified the informant who claimed to have been present at the meeting during which Marcello made the threat.(286) The committee also learned that even though the FBI was aware of the informant's allegations over a year and half before they were published in 1969, and possessed additional information indicating that the informant may in fact have met with Marcello in the fall of 1962, a substantive investigation of the information was never conducted. (287) Director Hoover and other senior FBI officials were aware that FBI agents were initiating action to \"discredit\" the informant, without having conducted a significant investigation of his allegations. (288) Further, the committee discovered that the originating office relied on derogatory information from a prominent underworld figure in the ongoing effort to discredit the informant (289) An internal memorandum to Hoover noted that another FBI source was taking action to discredit the informant, \"in order that the Carlos Marcello incident would be deleted from the book that first recounted the information. (290)\nThe committee determined that the informant who gave the account of the Marcello threat was in fact associated with various underworld figures, including at least one person well-acquainted with the Marcello organization.(291) The committee noted, however, that as a consequence of his underworld involvement, the informant had a questionable reputation for honesty and may not be a credible source of information. (292)\n9Law enforcement files have long contained information suggesting that Joseph Campisi, a restaurant owner in Dallas, occupied a position in organized crime. The committee's investigation did not confirm or refute the allegation, but it did establish that Ruby visited Campisi's restaurant on the evening of November 21 and that Ruby was visited in jail after the shooting of Oswald by Campisi and his wife. Further, Campisi acknowledged a long-standing business and personal relationship with Marcello. (283)\nPage 172\nThe committee noted further that it is unlikely that an organized crime leader personally involved in an assassination plot would discuss it with anyone other than his closest lieutenants, although he might be willing to discuss it more freely prior to a serious decision to undertake such an act. In his executive session appearance before the committee, Marcello categorically denied any involvement in organized crime or the assassination of President Kennedy. Marcello also denied ever making any kind of threat against the President's life.(293)\nAs noted, Marcello was never the subject of electronic surveillance coverage by the FBI. The committee found that the Bureau did make two attempts to effect such surveillance during the early 1960's, but both attempts were unsuccessful.(294) Marcello's sophisticated security system and close-knit organizational structure may have been a factor in preventing such surveillance. 10 A former FBI official knowledgeable about the surveillance program told the committee, \"That was our biggest gap .... With Marcello, you've got the one big exception in our work back then. There was just no way of penetrating that area. He was too smart.\"(296)\nAny evaluation of Marcello's possible role in the assassination must take into consideration his unique stature within La Cosa Nostra. The FBI determined in the 1960's that because of Marcello's position as head of the New Orleans Mafia family (the oldest in the United States, having first entered the country in the 1880's), the Louisiana organized crime leader had been endowed with special powers and privileges not accorded to any other La Cosa Nostra members. (297) As the leader of \"the first family\" of the Mafia in America, according to FBI information, Marcello has been the recipient of the extraordinary privilege of conducting syndicate operations without having to seek the approval of the national commission.(298)\nFinally, a caveat, Marcello's uniquely successful career in organized crime has been based to a large extent on a policy of prudence; he is not reckless. As with the case of the Soviet and Cuban Governments, a risk analysis indicated that he would be unlikely to undertake so dangerous a course of action as a Presidential assassination. Considering that record of prudence, and in the absence of direct evidence of involvement, it may be said that it is unlikely that Marcello was in fact involved in the assassination of the President. On the basis of the evidence available to it, and in the context of its duty to be cautious in its evaluation of the evidence, there is no other conclusion that the committee could reach. On the other hand, the evidence that he had the motive and the evidence of links through associates to both Oswald and Ruby, coupled with the failure of the 1963-64 investigation to explore adequately possible conspiratorial activity in the assassination, precluded a judgment by the committee that Marcello and his associates were not involved.\nTop of Page\n(7) Santos Trafficante.--The committee also concentrated its attention on Santos Trafficante, the La Cosa Nostra leader in Florida. The\n10In addition Marcello was considered by his FBI case agent to be a legitimate businessman, which may account for the fact that the case agent was less than enthusiastic about pressing an investigation of the Louisiana Mafia leader. (295)\nPage 173\ncommittee found that Trafficante, like Marcello, had the motive, means, and opportunity to assassinate President Kennedy. (299)\nTrafficante was a key subject of the Justice Department crackdown on organized crime during the Kennedy administration, with his name being added to a list of the top 10 syndicate leaders targeted for investigation. (300) Ironically, attorney General Kennedy's strong interest in having Trafficante prosecuted occurred during the same period in which CIA officials, unbeknownst to the Attorney General, were using Trafficante's services in assassination plots against the Cuban chief of state, Fidel Castro. (301)\nThe committee found that Santos Trafficante's stature in the national syndicate of organized crime, notably the violent narcotics trade, and his role as the mob's chief liaison to criminal figures within the Cuban exile community, provided him with the capability of formulating an assassination conspiracy against President Kennedy. Trafficante had recruited Cuban nationals to help plan and execute the CIA's assignment to assassinate Castro. (The CIA gave the assignment to former FBI Agent Robert Maheu, who passed the contract along to Mafia figures Sam Giancana and John Roselli. They, in turn, enlisted Trafficante to have the intended assassination carried out.) (302)\nIn his testimony before the committee, Trafficante admitted participating in the unsuccessful CIA conspiracy to assassinate Castro, an admission indicating his willingness to participate in political murder. (303) Trafficante testified that he worked with the CIA out of a patriotic feeling for his country, an explanation the committee did not accept, at least not as his sole motivation. (304)\nAs noted, the committee established a possible connection between Trafficante and Jack Ruby in Cuba in 1959. (305) It determined there had been a close friendship between Ruby and Lewis McWillie, who, as a Havana gambler, worked in an area subject to the control of the Trafficante Mafia family. (306) Further, it assembled documentary evidence that Ruby made at least two, if not three or more, trips to Havana in 1959 when McWillie was involved in underworld gambling operations there. (307) Ruby may in fact have been serving as a courier for underworld gambling interests in Havana, probably for the purpose of transporting funds to a bank in Miami. (308)\nThe committee also found that Ruby had been connected with other Trafficante associates--R. D. Matthews, Jack Todd, and James Dolan-- all of Dallas. (309)\nFinally, the committee developed corroborating evidence that Ruby may have met with Trafficante at Trescornia prison in Cuba during one of his visits to Havana in 1959, as the CIA had learned but had discounted in 1964. (310) While the committee was not able to determine the purpose of the meeting, there was considerable evidence that it did take place.(311)\nDuring the course of its investigation of Santos Trafficante, the committee examined an allegation that Trafficante had told a prominent Cuban exile, Jose Aleman, that President Kennedy was going to be assassinated. (312) According to Aleman, Trafficante made the statement in a private conversation with him that took place sometime in September 1962. (313) In an account of the alleged conversation pub-\nPage 174\nlished by the Washington Post in 1976, Aleman was quoted as stating that Trafficante had told him that President Kennedy was \"going to be hit.\" (314) Aleman further stated, however, that it was his impression that Trafficante was not the specific individual who was allegedly planning the murder. (315) Aleman was quoted as having noted that Trafficante had spoken of Teamsters Union President James Hoffa during the same conversation, indicating that the President would \"get what is coming to him\" as a result of his administration's intense efforts to prosecute Hoffa. (316)\nDuring an interview with the committee in March 1977, Aleman provided further details of his alleged discussion with Trafficante in September 1962.(317) Aleman stated that during the course of the discussion, Trafficante had made clear to him that he was not guessing that the President was going to be killed. Rather he did in fact know that such a crime was being planned.(318) In his committee interview, Aleman further stated that Trafficante had given him the distinct impression that Hoffa was to be principally involved in planning the Presidential murder. (319)\nIn September 1978, prior to his appearance before the committee in public session. Aleman reaffirmed his earlier account of the alleged September 1962 meeting with Trafficante. Nevertheless, shortly before his appearance in public session, Aleman informed the committee staff that he feared for his physical safety and was afraid of possible reprisal from Trafficante or his organization. In this testimony, Aleman changed his professed understanding of Trafficante's comments. Aleman repeated under oath that Trafficante had said Kennedy was \"going to be hit, but he then stated it was his impression that Trafficante may have only meant the President was going to be hit by \"a lot of Republican votes\" in the 1964 election, not that he was going to be assassinated. (320)\nAppearing before the committee in public session on September 28, 1978, Trafficante categorically denied ever having discussed any plan to assassinate President Kennedy. (321) Trafficante denied any foreknowledge of or participation in the President's murder. (322) While stating that he did in fact know Aleman and that he had met with him on more than one occasion in 1962, Trafficante denied Aleman's account of their alleged conversation about President Kennedy, and he denied ever having made a threatening remark against the President.(323)\nThe committee found it difficult to understand how Aleman could have misunderstood Trafficante during such a conversation, or why he would have fabricated such an account. Aleman appeared to be a reputable person, who did not seek to publicize his allegations, and he was well aware of the potential danger of making such allegations against a leader of La Costa Nostra. The committee noted, however, that Aleman's prior allegations and testimony before the committee had made him understandably fearful for his life.\nThe committee also did not fully understand why Aleman waited so many years before publicly disclosing the alleged incident. While he stated in 1976 that be had reported Trafficante's alleged remarks about the President to FBI agents in 1962 and 1963, the committee's review\nPage 175\nof Bureau reports on his contacts with FBI agents did not reveal a record of any such disclosure or comments at the time. (324) Additionally, the FBI agent who served as Aleman's contact during that period denied ever being told such information by Aleman.\nFurther, the committee found it difficult to comprehend why Trafficante, if he was planning or had personal knowledge of an assassination plot, would have revealed or hinted at such a sensitive matter to Aleman. It is possible that Trafficante may have been expressing a personal opinion, \"The President ought to be hit,\" but it is unlikely in the context of their relationship that Trafficante would have revealed to Aleman the existence of a current plot to kill the president. As previously noted with respect to Carlos Marcello, to have attained his stature as the recognized organized crime leader of Florida for a number of years. Trafficante necessarily had to operate in a characteristically calculating and discreet manner. The relationship between Trafficante and Aleman, a business acquaintance, does not seem to have been close enough for Trafficante to have mentioned or alluded to such a murder plot. The committee thus doubted that Trafficante would have inadvertently mentioned such a plot. In sum, the committee believed there were substantial factors that called into question the validity of Aleman's account.\nNonetheless, as the electronic surveillance transcripts of Angelo Bruno, Stefano Magaddino and other top organized crime leaders make clear, there were in fact various underworld conversations in which the desirability of having the President assassinated was discussed. (325) There were private conversations in which assassination was mentioned, although not in a context that indicated such a crime had been specifically planned.(326) With this in mind, and in the absence of additional evidence with which to evaluate the Aleman account of Trafficante's alleged 1962 remarks, the committee concluded that the conversation, if it did occur as Aleman testified, probably occurred in such a circumscribed context.\nAs noted earlier, the committee's examination of the FBI's electronic surveillance program of the early 1960's disclosed that Santos Trafficante was the subject of minimal, in fact almost nonexistent, surveillance coverage. (327) During one conversation in 1963, overheard in a Miami restaurant, Trafficante had bitterly attacked the Kennedy administration's efforts against organized crime, making obscene comments about \"Kennedy's right-hand man\" who had recently coordinated various raids on trafficante gambling establishments.(328) In the conversation, Trafficante stated that he was under immense pressure from Federal investigators, commenting \"I know when I'm beat, you understand? (329) Nevertheless, it was not possible to draw conclusions about Trafficante actions based on the electronic surveillance program since the coverage was so limited. Finally, as with Marcello, the committee noted that Trafficante's cautious character is inconsistent with his taking the risk of being involved in an assassination plot against the President. The committee found, in the context of its duty to be cautious in its evaluation of the evidence, that it is unlikely that Trafficante plotted to kill the President, although it could not rule out the possibility of such participation on the basis of available evidence.\nPage 176\nTop of Page\n(8) James R. Hoffa.--During the course of its investigation, the committee also examined a number of areas of information and allegations pertaining to James R. Hoffa and his Teamsters Union and underworld associates. The long and close relationship between Hoffa and powerful leaders of organized crime, his intense dislike of John and Robert Kennedy dating back to their role in the McClellan Senate investigation, together with his other criminal activities, led the committee to conclude that the former Teamsters Union president had the motive, means and opportunity for planning an assassination attempt upon the life of President John F. Kennedy.\nThe committee found that Hoffa and at least one of his Teamster lieutenants, Edward Partin, apparently did, in fact, discuss the planning of an assassination conspiracy against President Kennedy's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, in July or August of 1962.(330) Hoffa's discussion about such an assassination plan first became known to the Federal Government in September 1962, when Partin informed authorities that he had recently participated in such a discussion with the Teamsters president. (331)\nIn October 1962, acting under the orders of Attorney General Kennedy, FBI Director Hoover authorized a detailed polygraph examination of Partin. (332) In the examination, the Bureau concluded that Partin had been truthful in recounting Hoffa's discussion of a proposed assassination plan.(333) Subsequently, the Justice Department developed further evidence supporting Partin's disclosures, indicating that Hoffa had spoken about the possibility of assassinating the President's brother on more than one occasion. (334)\nIn an interview with the committee, Partin reaffirmed the account of Hoffa's discussion of a possible assassination plan, and he stated that Hoffa had believed that having the Attorney General murdered would be the most effective way of ending the Federal Government's intense investigation of the Teamsters and organized crime.(335) Partin further told the committee that he suspected that Hoffa may have approached him about the assassination proposal because Hoffa believed him to be close to various figures in Carlos Marcello's syndicate organization.(336) Partin, a Baton Rouge Teamsters official with a criminal record, was then a leading Teamsters Union official in Louisiana. Partin was also a key Federal witness against Hoffa in the 1964 trial that led to Hoffa's eventual imprisonment. (337)\nWhile the committee did not uncover evidence that the proposed Hoffa assassination plan ever went beyond its discussion, the committee noted the similarities between the plan discussed by Hoffa in 1962 and the actual events of November 22, 1963. While the committee was aware of the apparent absence of any finalized method or plan during the course of Hoffa's discussion about assassinating Attorney General Kennedy, he did discuss the possible use of a lone gunman equipped with a rifle with a telescopic sight, (338) the advisability of having the assassination committed somewhere in the South, (339) as well as the potential desirability of having Robert Kennedy shot while riding in a convertible. (34O) While the similarities are present, the committee also noted that they were not so unusual as to point ineluctably in a particular direction. President Kennedy himself, in fact, noted that he was vulnerable to rifle fire before his Dallas trip. Nevertheless, references\nPage 177\nto Hoffa's discussion about having Kennedy assassinated while riding in a convertible were contained in several Justice Department memoranda received by the Attorney General and FBI Director Hoover in the fall of 1962.(341) Edward Partin told the committee that Hoffa believed that by having Kennedy shot as he rode in a convertible, the origin of the fatal shot or shots would be obscured. (342) The context of Hoffa's discussion with Partin about an assassination conspiracy further seemed to have been predicated upon the recruitment of an assassin without any identifiable connection to the Teamsters organization or Hoffa himself.(343) Hoffa also spoke of the alternative possibility of having the Attorney General assassinated through the use of some type of plastic explosives. (344)\nThe committee established that President Kennedy himself was notified of Hoffa's secret assassination discussion shortly after the Government learned of it. The personal journal of the late President's friend, Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor of the Washington Post, reflects that the President informed him in February 1963 of Hoffa's discussion about killing his brother. (345) Bradlee noted that President Kennedy mentioned that Hoffa had spoken of the desirability of having a silenced weapon used in such a plan. Bradlee noted that while he found such a Hoffa discussion hard to believe \"the President was obviously serious\" about it. (346)\nPartly as a result of their knowledge of Hoffa's discussion of assassination with Partin in 1962, various aides of the late President Kennedy voiced private suspicions about the possibility of Hoffa complicity in the President's assassination.(347) The committee learned that Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and White House Chief of Staff Kenneth O'Donnell contacted several associates in the days immediately following the Dallas murder to discuss the possibility of Teamsters Union or organized crime involvement. (348)\nAs noted in the account of Ruby's telephone records, the committee confirmed the existence of several contacts between Ruby and associates of Hoffa during the period of October and November 1963,(349) including one Hoffa aide whom Robert Kennedy had once described as one of Hoffa's most violent lieutenants. (350) Those associates, Barney Baker, Irwin Weiner and Dusty Miller, stated that Ruby had been in touch with them for the sole purpose of seeking assistance in a nightclub labor dispute. (351)\nThe committee learned that Attorney General Kennedy and his aides arranged for the appointment of Charles Shaffer, a Justice Department attorney, to the Warren Commission staff in order that the possibility of Teamster involvement be watched. Shaffer confirmed to the committee that looking into Hoffa was one purpose of his appointment.(352)\nYet, partly as a result of the Commission's highly circumscribed approach to investigating possible underworld involvement, as well as limited staff resources, certain areas of possible information relating to Hoffa--such as the Ruby telephone calls--were not the subject of in-depth investigation.(353) Nevertheless, in a lengthy Commission memorandum prepared for the CIA in February 1964, the Teamsters Union had been listed first on a list of potential groups to be investigated in probing \"ties between Ruby and others who might have been interested in the assassination of President Kennedy.\" (354)\nPage 178\nDuring the course of its investigation, the committee noted the existence of other past relationships between Ruby and associates of Hoffa, apart from those disclosed by a review of the Ruby phone records. Two such figures were Paul Dorfman, the Chicago underworld figure who was instrumental in Hoffa's rise to power in the labor movement, and David Yaras, the reputed organized crime executioner whose relationship to Ruby dated back to their early days in Chicago. (355)\nThe committee also confirmed that another Teamsters official, Frank Chavez, had spoken to Hoffa about murdering Robert Kennedy in early 1967, shortly before Hoffa went to Federal prison. (356) During that incident, Hoffa reportedly sharply rebuked his aide, telling him that such a course of action was dangerous and should not be considered. (357)\nIn an interview with a newsman several weeks before his disappearance and presumed murder, Hoffa denied any involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy, and he disclaimed knowing anything about Jack Ruby or his motivations in the murder of Oswald. Hoffa also denied that he had ever discussed a plan to assassinate Robert Kennedy. (358)\nAs in the cases of Marcello and Trafficante, the committee stressed that it uncovered no direct evidence that Hoffa was involved in a plot on the President's life, much less the one that resulted in his death in Dallas in November 1963. In addition, and as opposed to the cases of Marcello and Trafficante, Hoffa was not a major leader of organized crime. Thus, his ability to guarantee that his associates would be killed if they turned Government informant may have been somewhat less assured. Indeed, much of the evidence tending to incriminate Hoffa was supplied by Edward Grady Partin, a Federal Government informant who was with Hoffa when the Teamster president was on trial in October 1962 in Tennessee for violating the Taft-Hartley Act. 11\nIt may be strongly doubted, therefore, that Hoffa would have risked anything so dangerous as a plot against the President at a time that he knew he was under active investigation by the Department of Justice.12\nFinally, a note on Hoffa's character. He was a man of strong emotions who hated the President and his brother, the Attorney General. He did not regret the President's death, and he said so publicly. Nevertheless, Hoffa was not a confirmed murderer, as were various organized crime leaders whose involvement the committee considered, and he cannot be placed in that category with them, even though he had extensive associations with them. Hoffa's associations with such organized crime leaders grew out of the nature of his union and the industry whose workers it represented. Organized crime and the violence of the labor movement were facts of life for Hoffa; they were part of the milieu in which he grew up and worked. But when he encountered the only specific plot against a Kennedy that came to the attention of the committee (the suggestion from Frank Chavez), he rejected it.\n11Hoffa was in fact facing charges of trying to bribe the jury in his 1962 trial in Tennessee on November 22, 1963. The case was scheduled to go to trial in January 1964. Hoffa was ultimately convicted and sentenced to a prison term. Partin was the Government's chief witness against him.\n12The committee found no evidence to indicate that Hoffa was under electronic surveillance.\nPage 179\nThe committee concluded, therefore, that the balance of the evidence argued that it was improbable that Hoffa had anything to do with the death of the President.\nTop of Page\n(c) Summary and analysis of the evidence\nThe committee also believed it appropriate to reflect on the general question of the possible complicity of organized crime members, such as Trafficante or Marcello, in the Kennedy assassination, and to try to put the evidence it had obtained in proper perspective.\nThe significance of the organized crime associations developed by the committee's investigation speaks for itself, but there are limitations that must be noted. That President Kennedy's assassin and the man who, in turn, murdered him can be tied to individuals connected to organized crime is important for one reason: for organized crime to have been involved in the assassination, it must have had access to Oswald or Ruby or both.\nThe evidence that has been presented by the committee demonstrates that Oswald did, in fact, have organized crime associations. Who he was and where he lived could have come to the attention of those in organized crime who had the motive and means to kill the President. Similarly, there is abundant evidence that Ruby was knowledgeable about and known to organized crime elements. Nevertheless, the committee felt compelled to stress that knowledge or availability through association falls considerably short of the sort of evidence that would be necessary to establish criminal responsibility for a conspiracy in the assassination. It is also considerably short of what a responsible congressional committee ought to have before it points a finger in a legislative context.\nIt must also be asked if it is likely that Oswald was, in fact, used by an individual such as Marcello or Trafficante in an organized crime plot. Here, Oswald's character comes into play. As the committee noted, it is not likely that Oswald was a hired killer; it is likely that his principal motivation in the assassination was political. Further, his politics have been shown to have been generally leftwing, as demonstrated by such aspects of his life as his avowed support of Fidel Castro. Yet the organized crime figures who had the motive and means to murder the President must be generally characterized as rightwing and anti-Castro. Knitting these two contradictory strands together posed a difficult problem. Either the assassination of President Kennedy was essentially an apolitical act undertaken by Oswald with full or partial, knowledge of who he was working for--which would be hard to believe--or Oswald's organized crime contacts deceived him about their true identity and motivation, or else organized crime was not involved.\nFrom an organized crime member's standpoint, the use of an assassin with political leanings inconsistent with his own would have enhanced his insulation from identification with the crime. Nevertheless, it would have made the conspiracy a more difficult undertaking, which raises questions about the likelihood that such a conspiracy occurred. The more complicated a plot becomes, the less likely it will work. Those who rationally set out to kill a king, it may be argued, first design a plot that will work. The Oswald plot did in fact work, at\nPage 180\nleast for 15 years, but one must ask whether it would have looked workable 15 years ago. Oswald was an unstable individual. Shortly before the assassination, for example, he delivered a possibly threatening note to the Dallas FBI office. With his background, he would have been an immediate suspect in an assassination in Dallas, and those in contact with him would have known that. Conspirators could not have been assured that Oswald or his companion would be killed in Dealey Plaza; they could not be sure that they could silence them. The plot, because of Oswald's involvement, would hardly have seemed to be a low risk undertaking.\nThe committee weighed other factors in its assessment of Oswald, his act and possible co-conspirators. It must be acknowledged that he did, in the end, exhibit a high degree of brutal proficiency in firing the shot that ended the President's life, and that, as an ex-marine, that proficiency may have been expected. In the final analysis, it must be admitted that he accomplished what he set out to do.\nFurther, while Oswald exhibited a leftist political stance for a number of years, his activities and associations were by no means exclusively leftwing. His close friendship with George de Mohrenschildt, an oilman in Dallas with rightwing connections, is a case in point. Additionally, questions have been raised about the specific nature of Oswald's pro-Castro activities. It has been established that on at least one occasion in 1963, he offered his services for clandestine paramilitary actions against the Castro regime, though, as has been suggested, he may have merely been posing as an anti-Castro activist.\nThat the evidence points to the possibility that Oswald was also associated in 1963 with David Ferrie, the Marcello operative who was openly and actively anti-Castro, is troubling, too. Finally, the only Cuba-related activities that have ever been established at 544 Camp Street, New Orleans, the address of an office building that Oswald stamped on some of his Fair Play for Cuba Committee handouts, were virulently anti-Castro in nature.\nThus, the committee was unable to resolve its doubts about Lee Harvey Oswald. While the search for additional information in order to reach an understanding of Oswald's actions has continued for 15 years, and while the committee developed significant new details about his possible organized crime associations, particularly in New Orleans, the President's assassin himself remains not fully understood. The committee developed new information about Oswald and Ruby, thus altering previous perceptions, but the assassin and the man who murdered him still appear against a backdrop of unexplained, or at least not fully explained, occurrences, associations and motivations.\nThe scientific evidence available to the committee indicated that it is probable that more than one person was involved in the President's murder. That fact compels acceptance. And it demands re-examination of all that was thought to be true in the past. Further, the committee's investigation of Oswald and Ruby showed a variety of relationships that may have matured into an assassination conspiracy. Neither Oswald nor Ruby turned out to be \"loners,\" as they had been painted in the 1964 investigation. Nevertheless, the committee frankly acknowledged that it was unable firmly to identify the other gunman or the nature and extent of the conspiracy.\nPage 181\nTop of Page\n5.

Nevertheless, critics continued to imply that the Secret Service, the FBI or the CIA had somehow been involved in the tragedy in Dallas, and the Warren Commission itself came to be viewed by some as part of a Government effort to conceal the truth. With the revelation of the illegal domestic programs of the FBI and the foreign assassination plots of the CIA by the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities in 1976, speculation was rekindled that Government itself may have been involved in the President's death.\nThe committee carefully considered various charges of Government complicity and coverup. A major portion of its resources were devoted to examining a variety of allegations directed at the Secret Service, the FBI, and the CIA as well as the Warren Commission. As the investigation proceeded, the committee carefully sought evidence that Government agents had foreknowledge of an assassination, took advantage of it after the event, or afterwards covered up information relevant to ascertaining the truth. The committee made a conscientious effort, for example, to determine if the autopsy materials were authentic. Had they been tampered with, it would have raised the most serious of questions. The committee also carefully assessed the performance of the Secret Service in the planning and execution of the Dallas trip for signs that it may have actively sought to bring about the President's death. In addition, the committee carefully examined the relationship, if any, that Lee Harvey Oswald might have had with various governmental agencies, particularly the FBI and CIA. Over the years, there has been speculation that. Oswald might have been an FBI informant or an agent of the CIA. However Oswald is seen--patsy or perpetrator--his relationship to the agencies of the Government was crucial to assessing the question of Government complicity. If he had had a relationship with one or more of the agencies, serious issues would be raised. If he had not, the question would be less pressing.\nTop of Page\n(a) The Secret Service\nGo to the footnotes for this section.\nThe committee's investigation of alleged Secret Service complicity in the assassination was primarily, although not, exclusively, concerned with two questions. One, did the Secret Service facilitate the shooting by arranging a motorcade route that went through the heart of downtown Dallas and past the Texas School Book Depository? Two, did\nPage 182\nany Secret Service personnel engage in conduct at the site of the assassination that might indicate complicity in the assassination? The committee's investigation involved extensive file reviews, interviews, depositions, and hearings. Former White House personnel, Secret Service agents, Dallas Police Department officers, Texas public officials and private citizens who had witnessed the assassination were interviewed or questioned. In addition, relevant files and documents of former White House staff, the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department pertaining to the planning of the motorcade route were reviewed. These included the Secret Service's contingency plans for the Dallas trip that set forth scheduling, security factors and related considerations for the motorcade route.\nTop of Page\n(1) Connally testimony.---Governor John B. Connally testified at a public hearing that he first heard of the possibility of a Presidential trip to Texas during his gubernatorial campaign in the spring of 1962, when Vice President Johnson told him the President wanted to make a fundraising visit to the State. (1) Connally said he discussed the trip with the President himself in El Paso, Tex., in June 1963, and in October he went to the White House to help formulate plans.(2) According to former White House aides, President Kennedy expressed a desire to make use of a motorcade during the trip,(3) since he had found it a useful political instrument during his campaign for the Presidency. Further, the Dallas luncheon engagement under discussion involved only a limited speaking appearance, and Kennedy believed a motorcade would broaden his public exposure. (4)\nThe decision to use a motorcade was opposed initially by Governor Connally, who testified that he thought it would fatigue the President. (5) Frank Erwin, executive secretary of the Texas Democratic Committee, also opposed the motorcade, but for a different reason. He testified that because of Adlai Stevenson's ugly confrontation with rightwing extremists only weeks earlier, he was concerned about the possibility of a similar embarrassing and potentially difficult situation.(6) These objections, however, were overruled by the White House. (7)\nTop of Page\n(2) Choice of the motorcade route.--Once the motorcade decision was made, the choice of a route was dependent more upon the selection of a site for the President's luncheon speech than upon security considerations. The White House staff at first favored the Dallas Women's Building near the Dallas County Fairgrounds because its capacity was greater than that of the alternative site, the Trade Mart, a commercial center with more limited facilities. (8) The White House staff felt that the Women's Building would have permitted more of the President's supporters to attend.\nAccording to Jerry Bruno, a White House advance man, the route to the Women's Building would have led the motorcade to proceed along Main Street eastward to the Fairgrounds, which lay to the southeast of the business district. Access to Main Street on the west side of Dealey Plaza would have been by a cloverleaf from the expressway. Using this route, the motorcade would have proceeded at a relatively high speed (40 to 50 mph) into Dealey Plaza and it would maintain this speed until it reached the intersection of Main and Houston Streets where crowds would have gathered. (9)Had it taken\nPage 183\nthis route, the motorcade would not have passed directly in front of the Texas School Book Depository at the slow (approximately 11 mph) speed that it did enroute to the Trade Mart.\nIn his testimony, Forrest Sorrels, the special agent-in-charge of the Dallas Secret Service office in 1963, indicated that the Secret Service also preferred the Women's Building as the luncheon site because, as a single story structure, it would have been easier to secure than the Trade Mart.(10) For political reasons, however, Governor Connally insisted on the Trade Mart,1(11) and the White House acquiesced to his wishes so it could avoid a dispute with the Governor, whose assistance was needed to assure the political success of the trip.(12)\nAccordingly, a motorcade to the Trade Mart was planned, and since the purpose of the motorcade was to permit the President to greet well-wishers in downtown Dallas, the route that was chosen was west along Main, right on Houston, then left on Elm Street, proceeding past the book depository, and through Dealey Plaza. Main Street, according to Governor Connally, had been the usual route for ceremonial occasions,(13) such as a procession in 1936 although in the opposite direction--in honor of President Roosevelt, the last President to have traveled through Dallas in a motorcade.\nWhile the Secret Service was consulted regarding alternative luncheon sites, its role in the ultimate decisionmaking process was secondary to that of Governor Connally and the White House staff. (14) Similarly, once the actual motorcade route had been set, also without significant Secret Service input, it was the White House staff, not the Secret Service, who made the decision to publish the route in Dallas newspapers. Presidential aides wanted to assure maximum public exposure for President Kennedy. (15)\nThe committee found no evidence, therefore, suggesting that the selection of a motorcade route involved. Secret Service complicity in a plot to assassinate the President.2(18)\nTop of Page\n(3) Allegation a Secret Service agent was on the grassy knoll.- After the assassination, several witnesses stated they had seen or encountered Secret Service agents behind the stockade fence situated on the grassy knoll area and in the Texas School Book Depository. (19) Other witnesses reported Secret Service agents leaving the motorcade and running to various locations in Dealey Plaza. (20) Warren Commission critics have alleged that these Secret Service agents either participated in the assassination itself or were involved in a coverup of the evidence. (21)\nNone of the witnesses interviewed by the committee was able provide further corroborating information concerning their original statements. The majority, however, indicated that they were mistaken in their original interpretation of events.(22) Committee interviews or depositions with 11 of the 16 agents3 who were on duty with the motorcade and with their supervisors produced evidence that only one\n1Connally in effect indicated he would not support the fundraising visit if the Trade Mart was not the luncheon site.\n2The decision not to use a bubble top on the President's limousine was made by White House staff aides just minutes before the motorcade got underway. The Secret Service was not involved in the decision. (16) The bubble top, in any event, was not a bulletproof barrier designed to protect the limousine occupants. It served merely to shield them from inclement weather. (17)\n3One of the agents not interviewed had died. Affidavits were obtained from the remaining four.\nPage 184\nagent had left the motorcade at any time prior to the arrival at Parkland Hospital. This agent, Thomas \"Lem\" Johns, had been riding in Vice President Johnson's follow-up car. In an attempt to reach Johnson's limousine, he had left the car at the sound of shots and was momentarily on his own in Dealey Plaza, though he was picked up almost immediately and taken to Parkland Hospital.(23) In every instance, therefore, the committee was able to establish the movement and the activities of Secret Service agents. Except for Dallas Agent-in-Charge Sorrels, who helped police search the Texas School Book Depository, no agent was in the vicinity of the stockade fence or inside the book depository on the day of the assassination.(24)\nSignificantly, most of the witnesses who made identifications of Secret Service personnel stated that they had surmised that any plainclothed individual in the company of uniformed police officers must have been a Secret Service agent. (25) Because the Dallas Police Department had numerous plainclothes detectives on duty in the Dealey Plaza area,(26) the committee considered it possible that they were mistaken for Secret Service agents.\nOne witness who did not base his Secret Service agent identification merely upon observing a plainclothesman in the presence of uniformed police officers was Dallas police officer Joseph M. Smith. Smith, who had been riding as a motorcycle escort in the motorcade, ran up the grassy knoll immediately after the shooting occurred. He testified to the Warren Commission that at that time he encountered a man who stated that he was a Secret Service agent and offered supporting credentials. Smith indicated that he did not examine these credentials closely, and he then proceeded to search the area unsuccessfully for suspicious individuals. (27)\nThe committee made an effort to identify the person who talked to Patrolman Smith. FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty stated that Frank Ellsworth, then an agent for the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau of the Treasury Department, had indicated that he had been in the grassy knoll area and for some reason had identified himself to someone as a Secret Service agent. (28) The committee deposed Ellsworth, who denied Hosty's allegation. (29)\nThe committee did obtain evidence that military intelligence personnel may have identified themselves as Secret Service agents or that they might have been misidentified as such. Robert E. Jones, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who in 1963 was commanding officer of the military intelligence region that encompassed Texas, told the committee that from 8 to 12 military intelligence personnel in plainclothes were assigned to Dallas to provide supplemental security for the President's visit. He indicated that these agents had identification credentials and, if questioned, would most likely have stated that they were on detail to the Secret Service. (30)\nThe committee sought to identify these agents so that they could be questioned. The Department of Defense, however, reported that a search of its files showed \"no records ...indicating any Department of Defense Protective Services in Dallas.\"(31) The committee was unable to resolve the contradiction.\nTop of Page\n(4) Conclusion.--Based on its entire investigation, the committee found no evidence of Secret Service complicity in the assassination.\nPage 185\nTop of Page\n(b) The Federal Bureau of Investigation\nGo to the footnotes for this section.\nIn the weeks that followed the assassination, it was alleged in several newspaper articles that Lee Harvey Oswald had been an FBI informant. Consequently, the Warren Commission expended considerable effort addressing the question. Testimony was taken from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont, and FBI Special Agents John W. Fain, John L. Quigley and James P. Hosty, Jr. (1) \"All declared, in substance, that Oswald was not an informant or agent of the FBI, and that he did not act in any other capacity for the FBI, and that no attempt was made to recruit him in any capacity.\" In addition, \"Director Hoover and each Bureau agent, who according to the FBI would have been responsible for or aware of any attempt to recruit Oswald ...provided the Commission with sworn affidavits to this effect.\"1 This testimony was corroborated by the Warren Commission's independent review of FBI files. (3)\nNevertheless, the allegation that Oswald was associated in some capacity with the FBI persisted. (4) There are three main reasons for this that may be traced to actions by the Bureau.\nFirst, Oswald's address book contained the name, address, telephone number and automobile license plate number of Special Agent James P. Hoary. That entry has been a source of controversy, especially since this information was not contained in an FBI report to the Warren Commission in December 1963, one that purportedly contained the contents of the address book.\nSecond, based on FBI contacts with Oswald in Fort Worth in 1962 and New Orleans and Dallas in 1963, rumors that he was an informant for the Bureau continued to circulate.\nThird, shortly after the assassination, Dallas FBI agent Hosty destroyed a note that had been delivered to his office allegedly by Oswald shortly before the assassination. When that conduct was finally made public in 1975 it aroused great suspicions, especially since it had not been previously revealed, even to the Warren Commission. (5)\nThe committee attempted to investigate each of the alleged links between Oswald and the FBI. It conducted extensive file reviews, interviews, depositions, and hearings. Testimony was taken from present and former FBI officials and employees as well as from private citizens claiming to have relevant information. On occasion, formal explanations were sought directly from the FBI. Even though the testimony of two special agents of the FBI appeared to be seriously lacking credibility on two of the major issues (the destruction of the Oswald note and the omission of Hosty's name from a report purporting to contain a list of the entries in Oswald's notebook), the results of the committee's investigation were consistent with the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission. The committee found no credible evidence that Oswald was an FBI informant.\nTop of Page\n(1) Early rumors that Oswald was an informant--Shortly after the assassination of President Kennedy, rumors that Oswald had been an\n1Nine of the 10 affidavits executed by FBI agents denying that Oswald had been an informant were revised before the FBI submitted them to the Warren Commission. It had been alleged that these affidavits may have been materially altered. The committee found that none of the affidavits had been materially altered before delivery to the Warren Commission. The essential difference between the preliminary drafts and the final affidavits was that the drafts were witnessed by fellow FBI agents, whereas the final affidavits were witnessed by notaries public. In a few instances, minor changes of words of phrases were made, although none affected substance. (2)\nPage 186\nFBI informant began to circulate. This allegation was discussed in articles by Joseph C. Goulden, Alonzo Hudkins, and Harold Feldman, among others. (6) The committee's review of these articles indicated that they set forth the rumors and speculation concerning the informant issue, but they offered no direct evidence supporting the allegation. Moreover, Hudkins admitted to the committee that his involvement with the issue began when he and another newsman discussed by telephone a mythical FBI payroll number for Oswald in order to test their suspicion that they were under FBI surveillance. Hudkins told the committee that he was subsequently contacted by the FBI and asked what he knew about Oswald's alleged informant status, and that shortly afterward a newspaper article appeared in which the FBI denied any relationship with Oswald. (7) Neither Hudkins nor Goulden was able to give the committee any additional information that would substantiate the informant allegation. (8) The committee was unable to locate Feldman.\nTop of Page\n(2) The Hosty entry in Oswald's address book.-- After the assassination, Dallas police found Oswald's address book among his possessions and turned it over to the FBI in Dallas. It contained FBI Special Agent Hosty's name, address, telephone number and car license plate number.(9) Dallas FBI agents recorded some of the entries in the address book and, on December 23, 1963, sent a report to the Warren Commission. This report, however, did not include the Hosty entry.2(10)\nThe committee's review of the December 23 report established in likelihood that page 25 of that document, the page that logically would have contained the Hosty entry had it been properly included,3 had been retyped. The page was numbered in the upper left-hand corner, whereas all other pages of the report--save page 1, the retyping of which had been clearly recorded--were numbered at the bottom center. In addition, the horizontal margins of page 25 were unusually wide.\nThe former special agent who had coordinated the FBI's Dallas investigation and had submitted the December 23, 1963, report, testified in a committee executive session that he had ordered the contents of Oswald's notebook transcribed for the purpose of indicating any investigative leads. (11) The agent acknowledged that page 25 of the report would have contained the Hosty entry had it been included, and that both the numbering of that page and its unusually wide horizontal margins indicated it had been retyped.(12) Nevertheless, he stated that the page had not been retyped to mislead anyone, and indicated that the only reason the Hosty entry had been omitted from his report was because the original office memorandum setting out investigative leads generated from Oswald's address book had failed to include it. (13)\nA second special agent, the one who had prepared the original office memorandum that was incorporated into the December 23, 1963, re-\n2On January 25, 1964, the FBI independently questioned the Dallas office concerning the omission and later sent to the Warren Commission a report, dated February 11, 1964, that did include the Hosty entry. In addition, in a letter dated January 27, 1964, the FBI informed the Commission of the inclusion of the Hosty data in Oswald's address book.\n3This determination was based on a comparison of the other entries from Oswald's address book that did appear on page 25.\nPage 187\nport, testified that the Hosty entry had not been included because it was not considered to be of significance as an investigative lead. (14) This agent contended it had already been known that Hosty had called at the home of Ruth and Michael Paine looking for Oswald prior to the assassination, so the entry of his name and related data in Oswald's book would not have been of potential evidentiary value. (15)\nThe committee did not accept the explanation that the Hosty entry was omitted from the report because it was not of lead significance, since the FBI's December 23, 1963, report included other entries from Oswald's address book that clearly had no legal significance at the time. For example, by December 23, it was generally known that the Oswalds had been living at the Paine home, yet the Ruth Paine address book entry was included in the report. (16) Similarly, a Robert W. Oswald entry that referred to Oswald's brother would not have been significant as a lead at that time. (17) Numerous other examples could be given. (18) Moreover, the agent who prepared the memorandum failed to include in it several entries that he acknowledged could not automatically be dismissed as lacking in lead significance (e.g., numbers and letters of the alphabet whose meaning was not then known). (19)\nFinally, in the December 23 report that was given to the Warren Commission, the FBI did not indicate that the report of the address book's contents had been limited to those items of lead significance.4(20)\nWhen the committee apprised the FBI of the testimony of the two agents (first, the agent who coordinated the investigation; second, the one who prepared the memorandum that was incorporated in the December 23 report), the Bureau initiated its own inquiry. It produced an FBI airtel (an interoffice telegram) dated December 11, 1963, that seemed to verify that the second agent's original instructions were to set out investigative leads, rather than to transcribe the complete contents of the address book. (21) The FBI investigation also led to the discovery of a \"tickler\" copy of the December 23 report that did contain the Hosty entry on page 25. 5(22) The two agents were then reinterviewed by FBI investigators.\nBased on his review and analysis of FBI documents, the second agent substantially revised the testimony he had given the committee. He told the Bureau investigators that since his assignment was to review the information contained in Oswald's address book and to set out appropriate leads where necessary, he initially reproduced by dictation those entries in the address book that he thought might require investigative action. He recalled that he was vitally concerned with accuracy; consequently, he initially included the Hosty entry. Nevertheless, he explained that when he later had time to determine what investigative work remained to be done with regard to the address book he decided that it was not necessary to include the Hosty data in his second dictation of an investigative \"lead sheet.\" (23)\n4The agent who prepared the memorandum testified he did not know it would be incorporated in other reports and sent to the Warren Commission. The agent who coordinated the investigation was the one who actually prepared the report for transmission to the Warren Commission.\n5The term \"tickler\" refers to a copy of a report that is placed in a file for the purpose of reminding the file keeper of further action that must be taken with respect to the subject of the report.\nPage 188\nA December 8, 1977, report of the FBI interview with the second agent records his recollection in further detail:\nHe specifically recalls that by the time of the second dictation, he had had the opportunity to check on the Hosty entry to the extent that he was aware of Hosty's visits to the Paine residence and that the address book entry reflected the Dallas FBI Field Office telephone number and the license number of the Government vehicle assigned to Hosty.Page 189\nUpon learning these facts, he was convinced that the Hosty entry was not required in a \"lead sheet\" since it did not require further investigative attention. In addition, he was unofficially aware, through office conversations, that Hosty was being criticized not only in the media, but also by the FBI hierarchy, for his conduct of the Oswald case. Since he realized that a \"lead sheet\" would receive wide dissemination in the Dallas Field Office, he was doubly convinced that the Hosty data should not be included in the \"lead sheet\"-- Hosty's connection to the Oswald case was officially known and had been explained in previous reports, and, furthermore, he did not wish to cause Hosty any unnecessary unpleasantness or exposure. At that time he never considered that Hosty might have been a target of Lee Harvey Oswald, and, further, any contention that Hosty was involved in an assassination conspiracy would have been so preposterous that he would not even have thought of it. He, therefore, did not dictate the Hosty data and thereby excluded it from the product of his second dictation which was, in effect, an office memorandum to be used only as a \"lead worksheet.\" He also never considered that the \"lead sheet\" might have been converted to a report insert and disseminated outside the FBI. Had he known it would be, he would have considered that the memorandum or \"lead sheet\" should have reflected all the entries in the address book, to include Hosty's name, since to do otherwise would not have been an accurate reporting of the entire contents of the address book.\nHe could not recall specifically what may have occasioned the redoing of page 25 after the second dictation, but it is possible that it became necessary because either he or someone else noticed that the \"Ministry of Finances of the U.S.S.R.\" information should have been attributed to the Fame page in the address book as was the \"Katya Ford\" and \"Declan Ford\" information. This error was made by him during his first dictation and may have persisted through the second dictation, thereby necessitating an additional change which caused page 25, to be numbered as it appears in the December 23, 1963, report.\n[The second agent] concluded by stating that his recall of these events was triggered only by a review and discussion of all the pertinent documents retrieved. Until viewing the tickler version of the address book contents which reproduced the entries more identically than the \"lead sheet\" version with its editorializations, he had no specific recall with regard to his first dictation. (24)\nWhen the first agent was reinterviewed by the FBI, he was unable to explain the origin of the headquarters tickler copy. In addition, after reviewing the December 11, 1963, FBI headquarters airtel to the Dallas office, he indicated that, contrary to his earlier recollection, he never instructed the second agent to transcribe the address book. That order had apparently been issued by another special agent. (25)\nBureau interviews with the former special-agent-in-charge of the Dallas office in 1963 and six other special agents who were involved in the assassination investigation generated no additional information concerning how the tickler copy of the December 23, 1963, report on the contents of the address book came to reside in FBI headquarters. Nor did they shed new light on the circumstances surrounding the omission of the Hosty entry from the copy of the report that was sent to the Warren Commission. Laboratory tests for fingerprints were inconclusive. (26) They did not indicate who had worked on the tickler copy of the December 23 report. Laboratory tests did determine, however, that the typewriter used to prepare page 25 of the December 23 report had also been used to prepare all but 10 pages of the report.\nThe committee also sought testimony from Special Agent Hosty concerning the circumstances by which his name was entered in Oswald's notebook and why this particular entry might have been omitted from the December 23, 1963, report. Hosty stated that he had been assigned to internal security cases on both Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife Marina. (27) He recalled that he spoke briefly to Marina Oswald twice during the first week of November 1963 and that he had had no other contacts with her. (28) On this first occasion, he had given Ruth Paine, with whom Marina Oswald was residing, his name and telephone number and had told her to call him if she had any information on Oswald to give him.(29) It was Hosty's belief that Ruth Paine probably gave this information to Oswald. Hosty added that Oswald could have obtained the address of the Dallas FBI office from the front page of any Dallas telephone book. (30) Hosty believed that during his second visit to the residence, while he was talking to Ruth Paine, Marina Oswald went outside and copied his license plate number. (31) He suggested that Oswald may have wanted this data so he could write his self-serving letter of protest to the Soviet Embassy in Washington.(32) In addition, he stated that it is possible that Oswald wanted this information so that he could complain to the FBI in Dallas. (33) Hosty indicated that he could think of no good reason for withholding the references to him in Oswald's address book from the report on the address book that was sent to the Warren Commission, as this information was already well-known at the Dallas Police Department.(34) The committee also learned that Hosty dictated two memoranda in December 1963 that included the fact that his name and address were in Oswald's address book. In addition, FBI headquarters was aware of the Hosty entry in the address book; it had been made public by the media, and the FBI had advised the Warren Commission of it on January 27, 1964.\nBased on all this evidence, the committee concluded that there was no plan by the FBI to withhold the Hosty entry in Oswald's address book for sinister reasons. This conclusion was based on several factors,\nPage 190\nthe most important of which was the discovery of the tickler copy of the December 23, 1963 report.6\nThe committee considered the fact, on the other hand, that information about the entry was withheld. One explanation might be that it was unintentional, although the evidence was also consistent with an explanation that one or more Dallas FBI agents sought to protect Hosty from personal embarrassment by trying--ineffectually, as it turned out to exclude his name from the reporting. The committee, though it deemed the incident regrettable, found it to be trivial in the context of the entire investigation.\nTop of Page\n(3) FBI contacts with Oswald (Fort Worth, 1962).--Oswald was interviewed twice by FBI agents in Fort Worth in 1962 shortly after his return from the Soviet Union. (35) Special Agent Fain, who had been assigned the Oswald internal security case in Fort Worth, and Special Agent Burnett Tom Carter conducted the initial Oswald interview at the Fort Worth FBI office on June 26, 1962. In his report of this interview, Fain described Oswald as cold, arrogant and uncooperative. He also reported that when asked if he would be willing to submit to a polygraph examination, Oswald refused without giving a reason.(36)\nOn August 16, 1962, Fain and Special Agent Arnold J. Brown reinterviewed Oswald, this time in Fain's automobile near Oswald's Fort Worth residence. (37) The fact that the interview was conducted in Fain's car has been cited as an indication that Oswald was being developed as an informant.\nFain, Carter, and Brown submitted affidavits to the Warren Commission asserting Oswald was not an informant.(38) All three were interviewed by the committee, and they affirmed their previous positions.\nFain told the committee that in the first encounter, Oswald displayed a bad attitude and gave incomplete answers (39) while Carter remembered Oswald as arrogant, uncooperative, and evasive. (40) Fain said the second contact was necessitated by Oswald's bad attitude and incomplete answers in the first interview. In the second interview, Fain explained, Oswald invited him and Brown into his home, but decided to conduct the interview in his car so not to upset or frighten Oswald's wife.(41) Brown told the committee that his memory was hazy, but he did recall that he and Fain met Oswald as he was returning from work and that they interviewed him in or near Fain's car, possibly for the sake of convenience. (42)\nThe committee found the statements of these three FBI agents credible. They had legitimate reasons for contacting Oswald because his background suggested he might be a threat to the internal security of the United States. They corroborated each other's accounts of the two interviews of Oswald, and their statements were entirely consistent with reports written shortly after these interviews occurred. Given Oswald's documented unwillingness to cooperate, there was little reason to believe that he would have been considered by these agents for use as an informant.\n6The leadership of the FBI as of 1978, was deserving of credit, in the committee's estimate, for its efforts to find the truth about the Hosty entry in Oswald's address book. The committee doubted that the tickler copy of the December 23 memorandum would have been found if FBI officials had not been interested in resolving the issue.\nPage 191\nTop of Page\n(4) FBI contacts with Oswald (New Orleans, 1963).--The committee interviewed the special agent in charge of the FBI office in New Orleans in 1963 and three special agents who handled the Oswald case in that city, and it found their statements that Oswald had not been an FBI informant to be credible.\nHarry Maynor, the special agent in charge of the New Orleans FBI office in 1963, explained that if Oswald had been an FBI informant in New Orleans, he would have known about it because of his supervisory position; if Oswald had been paid for any information, would have approved the payments. Maynor noted that he had submitted an affidavit to the Warren Commission in which he had stated that no effort was made to develop Oswald as an informant.(43)\nSimilarly, former Special Agent Milton Kaack, who had been assigned the FBI security investigation of Oswald, told the committee that Oswald had never been an FBI informant. Kaack explained that if Oswald had been an FBI informant, he would have known about it by virtue of having been assigned the internal security case on him.7(44)\nThe statements of Maynor, Kaack, and two other former FBI employees were considered in the context of allegations made by three witnesses, William S. Walter, Orest Pena, and Adrian Alba.\nOn August 9, 1963, Oswald was arrested in New Orleans for disturbing the peace after he had gotten into a fight with anti-Castro Cubans while distributing Fair Play for Cuba Committee leaflets. FBI Special Agent John L. Quigley interviewed Oswald the following day in a New Orleans jail. (45) Quigley's willingness to meet with Oswald in jail has been cited as evidence that Oswald was an FBI informant. Moreover, in connection with this incident, William S. Walter, who was an FBI security clerk in New Orleans in 1963, told the committee that he had been on duty on the day this interview occurred. In response to Quigley's request for a file check on Oswald, he had determined that the New Orleans FBI office maintained both a security file and an informant file on Oswald.\nIn a committee interview, Quigley, who had submitted an affidavit to the Warren Commission asserting that, Oswald had not been an FBI informant, (47) reaffirmed his position. He explained that he interviewed Oswald at Oswald's request, and that he then checked the file indices at the New Orleans office and found that Oswald was the subject of a security investigation assigned to Special Agent Kaack. He advised that the indices check provided no indication that Oswald had ever been an FBI informant. He added that if Oswald had been an informant, he would have known about it by virtue of this indices search. (48)\nThe committee could find no independent basis for verifying Walter's testimony about an Oswald informant file, but another allegation made by him, unrelated to the informant issue, led the committee to reject his testimony in its entirety. In a committee deposition, Walter stated that on November 17, 1963, while he was on night duty as an FBI security clerk, he received a teletype from FBI headquarters warning of a possible assassination attempt against President Ken-\n7The committee asked Kaack why he had not submitted an affidavit to this effect to the Warren Commission. In response, Kaack indicated that this had not been done because no one had requested it.\nPage 192\nnedy during the forthcoming trip to Dallas on November 22 or 23, 1963. (49) Walter recalled that the teletype was addressed to all special agents in charge of FBI field offices and that it instructed them to contact criminal, racial and hate group informants in order to determine whether there was any basis for the threat.(50) Walter contended that this teletype was removed from the New Orleans FBI office files soon after the Kennedy assassination. (51)\nWalter admitted that he did not publicly allege the existence of this telephone until 1968 (52) At that time, the FBI instituted an investigation that failed to find any corroboration for Walter's story. According to the Bureau, no record of a teletype or any other kind of communication reporting that there would be an attempt to assassinate President Kennedy in Texas could be found. Over 50 FBI employees of the New Orleans FBI office were interviewed by the Bureau, and none of them stated that they had any knowledge of any such teletype. (53) In 1975, the Bureau reinvestigated the teletype allegation after Walter claimed he had retained a replica of the teletype and that it had been sent to all FBI field offices. The FBI examined the text of the alleged replica and determined that it varied in format and wording from the standard. The Bureau also reported that searches at each of its 59 field offices yielded no evidence indicating the existence of such a teletype. (54)\nWalter advised the committee that he did not know of anyone who could definitely substantiate his teletype allegation, although he suggested that his former wife, Sharon Covert, who also had worked for the FBI in New Orleans, might be able to do so. (55) Sharon Covert, however, advised the committee that she could not support any of Walter's allegations against the FBI and that Walter had never mentioned his allegations to her during their marriage. (56)\nNew Orleans Special Agent in Charge Maynor also denied that he had been contacted by Walter in regard to an assassination threat. (57)\nMore fundamentally, however, the committee was led to distrust Walter's account of the assassination teletype because of his claim that it had been addressed to the special agents in charge of every FBI field office. The committee found it difficult to believe that such a message could have been sent without someone 15 years later--a special agent in charge or an employee who might have seen the teletype-- coming forward in support of Walter's claim. The committee declined to believe that that many employees of the FBI would have remained silent for such a long time. Instead, the committee was led to question Walter's credibility. The committee concluded that Walter's allegations were unfounded.\nOrest Pena, a bar owner in New Orleans, testified that during the early 1960's he was an FBI informant who reported to Special Agent Warren D. deBrueys.(58) He told the committee that on several occasions he saw Oswald in the company of deBrueys and other Government agents in a restaurant and that he believed Oswald and deBrueys knew each other very well.8 Finally, Pena alleged that Special Agent\n8In this regard, William Walter testified that after the assassination of President Kennedy he found a single file pertaining to Oswald in SAC Harry G. Maynor's locked file cabinet. Walter stated that he did not recall the title of the file, and acknowledged that it may not have been an informant file, but he remembered that the name of FBI Special Agent Warren D. deBrueys appeared on the file jacket. As noted, the committee did not find Walter to be a credible witness.\nPage 193\ndeBrueys was \"transferred\" to Dallas at the same time Oswald was \"transferred\" there. He added that he was \"very, very, very sure\" that deBrueys went to Dallas before the assassination of President Kennedy. (59)\nPena maintained that a few days before he went to testify before the Warren Commission, deBrueys threatened him physically and warned him not to make any accusations against him. Pena also stated that Warren Commission staff counsel Wesley J. Liebeler did not cooperate with him and did not let him talk freely, so he decided to \"keep [his] mouth shut.\" (60)\nIn testimony before the committee, deBrueys denied that Oswald was his informant, that he had ever met Oswald, or that he had ever knowingly talked to him by telephone.(61) He acknowledged that he did use Pena informally as an occasional source of information because of his position as a bar owner in New Orleans, but he declined to characterize Pena as an informant because of the absence of any systematic reporting relationship. (62) He also denied having threatened Pena prior to Pena's Warren Commission testimony. (63) Finally, deBrueys testified that he was transferred to Dallas in 1963, but that this was the result of a temporary assignment to assist in the assassination investigation. (64) The transfer did not coincide with Oswald's move from New Orleans to the Dallas area.9\nFBI files served to corroborate relevant aspects of deBrueys' testimony. DeBrueys' personal file indicates that the only time he was transferred to Dallas was to work on the assassination investigation, and that he was in Dallas from November 23, 1963, until January 24, 1964. In addition, there is no Bureau record of Pena ever having served as an informant. This, too, supported deBrueys' testimony that Pena was never used on any systematic basis as a source of information.\nPena, moreover, was unable to explain adequately why he waited until 1975 to make this allegation, and he declined to testify specifically that Oswald was, in fact, an FBI informant. Pena's responses to committee questions on the informant issue and others were frequently evasive. (65) The committee found, therefore, that he was not a credible witness.\nAdrian Alba testified before the committee that he was an employee and part owner of the Crescent City Garage in New Orleans and that in the summer of 1963 he had become acquainted with Oswald, who worked next door at the Reily Coffee Co. (66) He related that one day an FBI agent entered his garage and requested to use one of the Secret Service cars garaged there. The FBI agent showed his credentials, and Alba allowed him to take a Secret Service car, a dark green Studebaker. Later that day or the next day, Alba observed the FBI agent in the car handing a white envelope to Oswald in front of the Reily Coffee Co, There was no exchange of words. Oswald, in a bent position, turned away from the car window and held the envelope close\n9The committee also asked deBrueys why he did not submit an affidavit to the Warren Commission on the informant issue. deBrueys testified that he was surprised not to have been called upon to submit an affidavit to the Warren Commission. He believed that he had signed an affidavit on the informant issue at Bureau headquarters within the past few years, but no longer recalled the specifics of this action. The Bureau informed the committee that, pursuant to regulations, deBrueys had submitted to the U.S. Attorney General a written synopsis of his testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. In this synopsis, deBrueys stated that he had denied under oath that Oswald was his informant or that he had ever knowingly spoken to Oswald.\nPage 194\nto his chest as he walked toward the Reily Coffee Co. Alba believed that he observed a similar transaction a day or so later as he was returning from lunch, but on this occasion he was farther away and failed to see what was handed to Oswald. Alba did not recall when the Secret Service car was returned or by whom. He never questioned Oswald about these incidents. (67)\nAlba did not relate his account of the transactions between Oswald and the FBI agent when he testified before the Warren Commission. (68). He told the committee in 1978 that he first remembered these incidents in 1970, when his memory was triggered by a television commercial showing a merchant running to and from a taxi to assist a customer. (69)\nThe committee examined Alba's records for possible corroboration. These records indicated that in 1963 several Secret Service agents had signed out two Studebakers, a Ford and a Chevrolet at various times, but the records did not indicate that any FBI agents had signed out any of these cars. (70)\nThe committee regarded Alba's testimony, at least on this point, to be of doubtful reliability and outweighed by the evidence provided by the former FBI personnel stationed in New Orleans.\nTop of Page\n(5) FBI contacts with Oswald (Dallas, 1963).--According to a 1964 FBI memorandum, an FBI agent, later identified as Will Hayden Griffin of the Dallas field office, allegedly stated in 1964 that Oswald was definitely an FBI informant and that FBI files in Washington would prove that fact.(71) Griffin, however, advised the committee that he had never made such an allegation. Moreover, in 1964, he had executed an affidavit specifically denying this allegation. (72) Griffin's position is consistent with that of other Dallas FBI personnel.\nJ. Gordon Shanklin, who was special-agent-in-charge of the Dallas FBI office in 1963, submitted an affidavit to the Warren Commission in which he denied that Oswald was an FBI informant.(73) In a committee interview, he again stated that Oswald was never an informant for the FBI in Dallas and he added he had not even heard of Oswald prior to President Kennedy's assassination. (74)\nSpecial Agent James P. Hosty, Jr., testified that Oswald had not been an FBI informant. (75) Hosty had submitted an affidavit to this effect to the Warren Commission.10 Hosty told the committee that he had never interviewed Oswald before the assassination of President Kennedy. From his testimony, it appeared that his only contacts with Oswald had been indirect, in the form of two occasions that he had conversed with Marina Oswald and Ruth Paine. He added that Oswald was neither an informant for Special Agent Fain in Fort Worth nor an informant for any FBI agent in New Orleans. Had Oswald been an informant in either case, Hosty insisted he would have known about it by virtue of having been assigned the internal security case on Oswald in Dallas. (76)\nHosty also addressed the purported Griffin allegation. He testified to the committee that Griffin knew that Jack Ruby had been a poten-\n10In addition to Hosty and Shanklin, several other FBI agents in Dallas executed affidavits for the Warren Commission denying that Oswald was an informant: Assistant Special-Agent-in-Charge Kyle G. Clark, former Special-Agent-in-Charge Curtis O. Lynum, and Special Agent Kenneth C. Howe.\nPage 195\ntial criminal informant for the FBI in Dallas. He suggested that someone could have heard Griffin talking about Ruby's contacts with the FBI and might then have repeated the story with the mistaken assertion that Griffin was talking about Oswald. (77)\nIn support of Hosty's explanation, Shanklin stated to the committee that the Dallas office did send the potential criminal informant file on Ruby to FBI headquarters in Washington after the Kennedy assassination. He added that he did not know whether this file was sent to the Warren Commission. 11(78) Griffin told the committee in a second interview that soon after the Kennedy assassination he learned that the FBI in Dallas had approached Ruby in order to obtain information from him. He advised that, although his recollection was unclear, he might have seen an FBI informant file on Ruby and then may have talked to persons outside the Bureau about the FBI's contacts with Ruby.\nTop of Page\n(6) The destruction of Oswald's note.--Approximately 2 or 3 weeks before the assassination of President Kennedy, Oswald allegedly delivered a note addressed to Hosty at the FBI office in Dallas. (80) The varying accounts of the note's contents suggest that it was threatening or complaining in tone, ordering Hosty to stop bothering Oswald's wife.(81) Several hours after Oswald was murdered by Jack Ruby, Hosty, according to his own admission, destroyed the note after having been instructed to do so by J. Gordon Shanklin, the special-agent-in-charge of the Dallas FBI office. (82) Shanklin denied that he knew anything about the note until a reporter asked him about it in 1975. (83) Between 1963 and 1975, the existence of the note and its destruction were kept secret by the Dallas FBI Office.\nIn his committee testimony, Hosty stated that the note, according to his memory, did not contain Oswald's name and that he first determined that the note might have been from Oswald on the day of the assassination of President Kennedy. Hosty explained that soon after Oswald's arrest, he was instructed to sit in on the interrogation of Oswald at the Dallas Police Department, and that when he identified himself to Oswald, Oswald became upset and stated that Hosty had been bothering his wife, Marina. Hosty suggested that Special-Agent-in-Charge Shanklin, who was told by another FBI agent about Oswald's reaction to Hosty, probably made the same connection between Oswald and the anonymous note. Hosty advised that he was surprised that Shanklin wanted him to destroy the note because the note's contents were not particularly significant.\nHosty recalled that the note was complaining in tone, but that it contained no threats and did not suggest that Oswald was prone to violence. Hosty stated that he destroyed the note because Shanklin, his superior, ordered him to do so. When asked what motivation Oswald might have had for writing this note, Hosty suggested that Oswald might have wanted to prevent Hosty from contacting his wife because he was afraid that she would tell Hosty about Oswald's trip to Mexico in the fall of 1963 and of his attempt to shoot Gen. Edwin Walker in the spring of 1963. (85)\n11The committee found no evidence that this file was ever sent to the Warren Commission, although details of the association were furnished by the Commission by letter.\nPage 196\nThe committee regarded the incident of the note as a serious impeachment of Shanklin's and Hosty's credibility. It noted, however, that the note, if it contained threats in response to FBI contacts with Oswald's wife, would have been evidence tending to negate an informant relationship. The committee noted further the speculative nature of its findings about the note incident. Because the note had been destroyed, it was not possible to establish with confidence what its contents were.\nTop of Page\n(7) Conclusion--In summary, although there have been many allegations of an Oswald-FBI informant relationship, there was no credible evidence that Oswald was ever an informant for the Bureau. Absent a relationship between Oswald and the FBI, grounds for suspicions of FBI complicity in the assassination become remote.\nTop of Page\n(c) The Central Intelligence Agency 1\nGo to the footnotes for this section.\nIn 1964, the CIA advised the Warren Commission that the Agency had never had a relationship of any kind with Lee Harvey Oswald. Testifying before the Commission, CIA Director John A. McCone indicated that:\nOswald was not an agent, employee, or informant of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Agency never contacted him, interviewed him, talked with him, or solicited any reports or information from him, or communicated with him directly or in any other manner ...Oswald was never associated or connected directly or indirectly in any way whatsoever with the Agency. (1)McCone's testimony was corroborated by Deputy Director Richard M. Helms. (2) The record reflects that once these assurances had been received, no further efforts were made by the Warren Commission to pursue the matter.\nRecognizing the special difficulty in investigating a clandestine agency, the committee sought to resolve the issue of Oswald's alleged association with the CIA by conducting an inquiry that went beyond taking statements from two of the Agency's most senior officials. The more analytical approach used by the committee consisted of a series of steps:\nFirst, an effort was made to identify circumstances in Oswald's life or in the way his case was handled by the CIA that possibly suggested an intelligence association.1For a brief history of the CIA and description of its organizational structure, see Section I D 4 infra.\nThen, the committee undertook an intensive review of the pertinent files, including the CIA's 144-volume Oswald file and hundreds of others from the CIA, FBI, Department of State, Department of Defense and other agencies.\nBased on these file reviews, a series of interviews, depositions and executive session hearings was conducted with both Agency and non-Agency witnesses. The contacts with present and former CIA personnel covered a broad range of individuals, including staff and division chiefs, Clandestine case officers, area desk officers, research analysts, secretaries and clerical assistants. In total, more\nPage 197\nthan 125 persons, including at least 50 present and former CIA employees, were questioned.2\nThe results of this investigation confirmed the Warren Commission testimony of McCone and Helms. There was no indication in Oswald's CIA file that he had ever had contact with the Agency. Finally, taken in their entirety, the items of circumstantial evidence that the committee had selected for investigation as possibly indicative of an intelligence association did not support the allegation that Oswald had an intelligence agency relationship.\nThis finding, however, must be placed in context, for the institutional characteristics--in terms of the Agency's strict compartmentalization and the complexity of its enormous filing system--that are designed to prevent penetration by foreign powers have the simultaneous effect of making congressional inquiry difficult. For example, personnel testified to the committee that a review of Agency files would not always indicate whether an individual was affiliated with the Agency in any capacity. (3) Nor was there always an independent means of verifying that all materials requested from the Agency had, in fact, been provided. Accordingly, any finding that is essentially negative in nature--such as that Lee Harvey Oswald was neither associated with the CIA in any way, nor ever in contact with that institution--should explicitly acknowledge the possibility of oversight.\nTo the extent possible, however, the committee's investigation was designed to overcome the Agency's security-oriented institutional obstacles that potentially impede effective scrutiny of the CIA. The vast majority of CIA files made available to the committee were reviewed in undeleted form.(4) These files were evaluated both for their substantive content and for any potential procedural irregularities suggestive of possible editing or tampering. After review, the files were used as the basis for examination and cross-examination of present and former Agency employees. Each of the present and former Agency employees contacted by the committee was released from his secrecy oath by the CIA insofar as questions relevant to the committee's legislative mandate were concerned. Because of the number of Agency personnel who were interrogated,(5) it is highly probable that significant inconsistencies between the files and witnesses' responses would have been discovered by the committee.\nDuring the course of its investigation, the committee was given access by the CIA to information based on sensitive sources and methods that are protected by law from unauthorized disclosure. The committee noted that in some circumstances disclosure of such information in detail would necessarily reveal the sensitive sources and methods by which it was acquired. With respect to each item of such information, the committee carefully weighed the possible advancement of public understanding that might accrue from disclosure of the details of the information against the possible harm that might be done to the national interests and the dangers that might result to individuals. To\n2The committee also attempted to identify CIA employees who may have had the motive, means and opportunity to assassinate President Kennedy. In this regard, no useful information was generated from selected file reviews. An effort was also made to locate a man identified as Maurice Bishop who was said to have been a CIA officer who had been seen in the company of Lee Harvey Oswald. The effort to find \"Bishop\" was likewise unsuccessful.\nPage 198\nthe extent required by the balancing process, sections of this report were written in a somewhat conclusionary manner in order to continue the protection of such classified information.\nTop of Page\n(1) CIA personnel in the Soviet Russia Division.3--Since Oswald spent time in the Soviet Union, a subject of special attention by the committee was the Russia-related activities of the CIA. In addition to obtaining testimony from former Directors McCone and Helms, the committee interviewed the chiefs of the Soviet Russia Division from 1959 to 1963. In each case, the committee received a categorical denial of any association of the CIA with Oswald. (6)\nTo investigate this matter further, the committee interviewed the persons who had been chiefs or deputy chiefs during 1959-62 of the three units within the Soviet Russia Division that were responsible respectively for clandestine activities, research in support of clandestine activities, and the American visitors program. 4 The heads of the clandestine activity section stated that during this period the CIA had few operatives in the Soviet Union and that Oswald was not one of them. Moreover, they stated that because of what they perceived to be his obvious instability, Oswald would never have met the Agency's standards for use in the field 5(7) The heads of the Soviet Russia Division's section that sought the cooperation of visitors to the Soviet Union informed the committee that they met with each person involved in their program and that Oswald was not one of them.(8) These officials also advised the committee that \"clean-cut\" collegiate types tended to be used in this program, and that Oswald did not meet this criterion.(9) Finally, the officers in charge of the Soviet Russia Division's research section in support of clandestine activities indicated that, had Oswald been contacted by the Agency, their section would probably have been informed, but that this, in fact, never occurred. (10)\nTop of Page\n(2) CIA personnel abroad.--Turning to particular allegations, the committee investigated the statement of former CIA employee James Wilcott, who testified in executive session that shortly after the assassination of President Kennedy he was advised by fellow employees at a CIA post abroad that Oswald was a CIA agent who had received financial disbursements under an assigned cryptonym.6(11) Wilcott explained that he had been employed by the CIA as a finance officer from 1957 until his resignation in 1966. In this capacity, he\n3Classified analyses of these issues, written in undeleted form, are in the committee's files.\n4The visitors program sought the cooperation, for limited purposes, of carefully selected persons traveling in the Soviet Union. For this unit, only the years 1959-61 were covered. Nevertheless, since every American traveler who was involved in this program was contacted before visiting the Soviet Union, the relevant year for Lee Harvey Oswald was 1959, the year he departed from the United States.\n5One officer acknowledged the remote possibility that an individual could have been run by someone as part of a \"vest pocket\" (private or personal) operation without other Agency officials knowing about it. But even this possibility, as it applies to Oswald, was negated by the statement of the deputy chief of the Soviet Russia clandestine activities section. He commented that in 1963 he was involved in a review of every clandestine operation ever run in the Soviet Union, and Oswald was not involved in any of these cases.\n6A cryptonym us a code designation for an agency project, program or activity or an organization, agency or individual (for whom a legal signature is not required) having a sensitive operational relationship with the agency. Cryptonyms are used in communications only to the extent necessary to protect sensitive information from disclosure to unauthorized persons. They are used (1) when disclosure of the true identity of persons, organizations or activities would be detrimental to the interest of the U.S. Government or to the persons, organizations or activities concerned; or (2) to prevent disclosure of a sensitive operational relationship with the agency.\nPage 199\nserved as a fiscal account assistant on the support staff at a post abroad from June 1960 to June 1964. In addition to his regular responsibilities, he had performed security duty on his off-hours in order to supplement his income. This put him in contact with other employees of the post who would come by the office and engage in informal conversations. On the day after President Kennedy's assassination, Wilcott claimed he was informed by a CIA case officer that Oswald was an agent.(12) He further testified that he was told that Oswald had been assigned a cryptonym and that Wilcott himself had unknowingly disbursed payments for Oswald's project. (13) Although Wilcott was unable to identify the specific case officer who had initially informed him of Oswald's agency relationship, he named several employees of the post abroad with whom he believed he had subsequently discussed the allegations. (14)\nWilcott advised the committee that after learning of the alleged Oswald connection to the CIA, he never rechecked official Agency disbursement records for evidence of the Oswald project. He explained that this was because at that time he viewed the information as mere shop talk and gave it little credence. (15) Neither did he report the allegations to any formal investigative bodies, as he considered the information hearsay.(16) Wilcott was unable to recall the agency cryptonym for the particular project in which Oswald had been involved, (17) nor was he familiar with the substance of that project. In this regard, however, because project funds were disbursed on a code basis, as a disbursement officer he would not have been apprised of the substantive aspects of projects.\nIn an attempt to investigate Wilcott's allegations, the committee interviewed several present and former CIA employees selected on the basis of the position each had held during the years 1954-64. Among the persons interviewed were individuals whose responsibilities covered a broad spectrum of areas in the post abroad, including the chief and deputy chief of station, as well as officers in finance, registry, the Soviet Branch and counterintelligence.\nNone of these individuals interviewed had ever seen any documents or heard any information indicating that Oswald was an agent. (18) This allegation was not known by any of them until it was published by critics of the Warren Commission in the late 1960's.(19) Some of the individuals, including a chief of counterintelligence in the Soviet Branch, expressed the belief that it was possible that Oswald had been recruited by the Soviet KGB during his military tour of duty overseas, as the CIA had identified a KGB program aimed at recruiting U.S. military personnel during the period Oswald was stationed there. (20) An intelligence analyst whom Wilcott had specifically named as having been involved in a conversation about the Oswald allegation told the committee that he was not in the post abroad at the time of the assassination.(21) A review of this individual's office of personnel file confirmed that, in fact, he had been transferred from the post abroad to the United States in 1962. (22) The chief of the post abroad from 1961 to 1964 stated that had Oswald been used by the Agency he certainly would have learned about it.(23) Similarly, almost all those persons interviewed who\nPage 200\nworked in the Soviet Branch of that station indicated they would have known if Oswald had, in fact, been recruited by the CIA when he was overseas.(24) These persons expressed the opinion that, had Oswald been recruited without their knowledge, it would have been a rare exception contrary to the working policy and guidelines of the post abroad. (25)\nBased on all the evidence, the committee concluded that Wilcott's allegation was not worthy of belief.\nTop of Page\n(3) Oswald's CIA file.--The CIA has long acknowledged that prior to the president's assassination, it had a personality file on Oswald, that is, a file that contained data about Oswald as an individual. This file, which in Agency terminology is referred to as a 201 file, was opened on December 9, 1960. (26) The Agency explained that 201 files are opened when a person is considered to be of potential intelligence or counterintelligence significance.(27) The opening of such a file is designed to serve the purpose of placing certain CIA information pertaining to that individual in one centralized records system. The 201 file is maintained in a folder belonging to the Directorate for Operations, the Agency component responsible for clandestine activities.(28)\nThe existence of a 201 file does not necessarily connote any actual relationship or contact with the CIA. For example, the Oswald file was opened, according to the Agency, because as an American defector, he was considered to be of continuing intelligence interest.(29) Oswald's file contained no indication that he had ever had a relationship with the CIA. Nevertheless, because the committee was aware of one instance (in an unrelated case) where an Agency officer had apparently contemplated the use of faked files with forged documents, (30) special attention was given to procedural questions that were occasioned by this file review.\nTop of Page\n(4) Why the delay in opening Oswald's 201 file?--A confidential State Department telegram dated October 31, 1959, sent from Moscow to Washington and forwarded to the CIA, reported that Oswald, a recently discharged Marine, had appeared at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to renounce his American citizenship and \"has offered Soviets any information he has acquired as [an] enlisted radar operator.\"(31) At least three other communications of a confidential nature that gave more detail on the Oswald case were sent to the CIA in about the same time period.(32) Agency officials questioned by the committee testified that the substance of the October 31, 1959, cable was sufficiently important to warrant the opening of a 201 file.(33) Oswald's file was not, however, opened until December 9, 1960.(34)\nThe committee requested that the CIA indicate where documents pertaining to Oswald had been disseminated internally and stored prior to the opening of his 201 file. The agency advised the committee that because document dissemination records of relatively low national security significance are retained for only a 5-year period, they were no longer in existence for the years 1959-63. (35) 8 Consequently, the Agency was unable to explain either when these documents had been received or by which component.\n8None of these documents were classified higher than confidential\nPage 201\nAn Agency memorandum, dated September 18, 1975, indicates that Oswald's file was opened on December 9, 1960, in response to the receipt of five documents: two from the FBI, two from the State Department and one from the Navy. (36) This explanation, however, is inconsistent with the presence in Oswald's file of four State Department documents dated in 1959 and a fifth dated May 25, 1960. It is, of course, possible that the September 18, 1975, memorandum is referring to State Department documents that were received by the Directorate for Plans 9 in October and November of 1960 and that the earlier State Department communications had been received by the CIA's Office of Security but not the Directorate for Plans. In the absence of dissemination record however, the issue could not be resolved.\nThe September 18, 1975, memorandum also states that Oswald's file was opened on December 9, 1960, as a result of his \"defection\" to the U.S.S.R. on October 31, 1959 and renewed interest in Oswald brought about by his queries concerning possible reentry into the United States.\"(37) There is no indication, however, that Oswald expressed to any U.S. Government official an intention to return to the United States until mid-February 1961. (38) Finally, reference to the original form that was used to start a file on Oswald did not resolve this issue because the appropriate space that would normally indicate the \"source document\" that initiated the action referred to an Agency component rather than to a dated document. 10(39)\nThe committee was able to determine the basis for opening Oswald's file on December 9, 1960, by interviewing and then deposing the Agency employee who was directly responsible for initiating the opening action. This individual explained that the CIA had received a request from the State Department for information concerning American defectors. After compiling the requested information, she responded to the inquiry and then opened a 201 file on each defector involved. (40)\nThis statement was corroborated by review of a State Department letter which indicated that such a request, in fact, had been made of the CIA on October 25, 1960. Attached to the State Department letter was a list of known defectors; Oswald's name was on that list. The CIA responded to this request on November 21, 1960, by providing the requested information and adding two names to the State Department's original list. (41)\nSignificantly, the committee reviewed the original State Department list and determined that files were opened in December 1960 for each of the five (including Oswald) who did not have 201 files prior to receipt of the State Department inquiry. In each case, the slot for \"source document\" referred to an Agency component rather than to a dated document.(42)\nEven so, this analysis only explained why a file on Oswald was finally opened; it did not explain the seemingly long delay in opening of the file. To determine whether such a delayed opening was unusual, the committee reviewed the files of 13 of the 14 persons on the CIA's November 21 1960, response to the State Department and\n9The Directorate for Plans was the predecessor of the Directorate of Operations.\n10The Agency indicated that it is customary to refer to a component when the opening action is taken on that component's authority.\nPage 202\nof 16 other defectors (from an original list of 380) who were American-born, had defected during the years 1958-63, and who had returned to the United States during that same time period. Of 29 individuals whose files were reviewed, 8 had been the subject of 201 files prior to the time of their defection. In only 4 of the remaining cases were 201 files opened at the time of defection. The files on the 17 other defectors were opened from 4 months to several years after the defection. (43) At the very least, the committee's review indicated that during 1958-63, the opening of a file years after a defection was not uncommon. In many cases, the opening was triggered by some event, independent of the defection, that had drawn attention to the individual involved.\nTop of Page\n(5) Why was he carried as Lee Henry Oswald in his 201 file?\nOswald's 201 file was opened under the name Lee Henry Oswald. (44) No Agency witness was able to explain why. All agency personnel however, including the person who initiated the file opening, testified that this must have been occasioned innocently by bureaucratic error.(45) Moreover, the committee received substantial testimony to the effect that this error would not-have prevented the misnamed file from being retrieved from the CIA's filing system during a routine name trace done under the name Lee Harvey Oswald. (46)\nTop of Page\n(6) The meaning of \"AG\" under \"Other Identification\" in Oswald's 201 file.---The form used to initiate the opening of a 201 file for Lee Harvey Oswald contains the designation AG in a box marked \"Other Identification.\" Because this term was considered to be of potential significance in resolving the issue of Oswald's alleged Agency relationship, the CIA was asked to explain its meaning.\nThe Agency's response indicated that \"AG\" is the OI (\"Other Identification\") code meaning \"actual or potential defectors to the East or the Sino/Soviet block including Cuba,\" and that anyone so described could have the OI code \"AG.\" This code was reportedly added to Oswald's opening form because of the comment on the form that he had defected to the Soviet Union in 1959. (47)\nAn Agency official, who was a Directorate of Operations records expert and for many years one who had been involved in the CIA's investigation of the Kennedy assassination, gave the committee a somewhat different explanation of the circumstances surrounding the term \"AG\" and its placement on Oswald's opening form. This individual testified that \"AG\" was an example of a code used to aid in preparing computer listings of occupational groupings or intelligence affiliations. He explained that these codes always used two letters and that, in this case, the first letter \"A\" must have represented communism, while the second letter would represent some category within the Communist structure.(48)\nHis recollection was that at the time of the assassination, the \"AG\" code was not yet in existence because there were no provisions then in effect within the Agency for indexing American defectors. He recalled that it was only during the life of the Warren Commission that the CIA realized that its records system lacked provisions for indexing an individual such as Oswald. Consequently, the CIA revised its records manual to permit the indexing of American defectors and established a code for its computer system to be used for that category. Although\nPage 203\nthis witness did not know when the notation \"AG\" was added to Oswald's opening sheet, he presumed that it must have been following the addition of the American defector code, thus placing the time somewhere in the middle of the Warren Commission's investigation. He explained that it was difficult to determine when any of the notations on the opening sheet had been made, since it was standard procedure to update the forms whenever necessary so that they were as reflective as possible of the available information.11(49)\nFinally, this witness testified that the regulations regarding the use of this occupation and intelligence code specifically prohibited indicating that a particular person was either an employee of the Agency or someone who was used by the Agency. This prohibition was designed to prevent anyone from being able to produce any kind of categorical listing of CIA employees, contacts or connections.(50)\nTop of Page\n(7) Why was Oswald's 201 file restricted?--The form used to initiate the opening of Oswald's 201 file contains a notation indicating that the file was to be \"restricted\". (51) This indication was considered potentially significant because of the CIA's practice of restricting access to agents' files to persons on a \"need-to-know\" basis. Further investigation revealed, however, that restricting access to a file was not necessarily indicative of an relationship with the CIA.\nThe individual who actually placed the restriction on Oswald's file testified that this was done simply to allow her to remain aware of any developments that might have occurred with regard to the file.(52) The restriction achieved this purpose because any person seeking access to the file would first have to notify the restricting officer, at which time the officer would be apprised of any developments.\nThis testimony was confirmed by a CIA records expert who further testified that had the file been permanently charged to a particular desk or case officer, as well as restricted, the possibility of a relationship with the CIA would have been greater. (53) There is no indication on Oswald's form that it had been placed on permanent charge.\nFinally, the committee reviewed the files of four other defectors that had been opened at the same time and by the same person as Oswald's, and determined that each of the files had been similarly restricted. Each of these other individuals was on the lists of defectors that had been exchanged by the CIA and State Department. None of the files pertaining to these other defectors had any evidence suggestive of a possible intelligence agency association.\nTop of Page\n(8) Were 37 documents missing from Oswald's 201 file?-- In the course of reviewing Oswald's 201 file, the committee discovered an unsigned memorandum to the Chief of Counterintelligence. Research and Analysis, dated February 20, 1964, which stated that 37 documents were missing from Oswald's 201 file.(54) According to the memorandum, this statement was based on a comparison of a machine listing of documents officially recorded as being in the 201 file and those documents actually physically available in the file. (55) While the memorandum mentioned that such a machine listing was attached, no such attachment was found in the 201 file at the time of the committee's\n11The CIA, after considering this witness' recollection of the origin of the AG code, adhered to its original position regarding this issue.\nPage 204\nreview. The memorandum itself bears the classification \"Secret Eyes Only\" and was one of the documents that had been fully withheld from release under the Freedom of Information Act. (56)\nIn response to a committee inquiry, the CIA advised that, because Oswald's file had been so active during the course of the Warren Commission investigation, up-to-date machine listings were produced periodically. On this basis, the Agency stated that\n...it must be assumed that whoever was responsible for maintaining the Oswald file brought this file up-to-date by locating the 37 documents and placing them in the file. (57)Because this response was incomplete, the author of the memorandum was deposed. He testified that once a document had been registered into a 201 file by the Agency's computer system, physical placement of the document in the file was not always necessary. (58) On this basis, he explained, the items listed in the memorandum were not missing but rather had either been routinely placed in a separate file because of their sensitivity or were being held by other individuals who needed them for analytical purposes. (59) He further stated that in the course of his custodianship of Oswald's file, he had requested perhaps as many as 100 computer listings on the contents of the Oswald file. While there had been many instances in which one or more documents had been charged out to someone, he stated that he had never discovered that any documents were actually missing. (60) According to his testimony, the 37 documents were, in fact, available, but they were not located in the file at the time. (61) The committee regarded this to be a plausible explanation.\nTop of Page\n(9) Did the CIA maintain a dual filing system on Oswald?-- The committee was aware of the possibility that a dual filing system (one innocuous file and one that contained operational detail of a relationship with the CIA) could have been used to disguise a possible relationship between Oswald and the Agency. This awareness became a concern with the discovery that at least two Agency officers had contemplated the use of faked files and forged documents to protect the ZR Rifle project from disclosure.12(62) The implications of this discovery in terms of the possibility that the Oswald file might also have been faked were disturbing to the committee.\nIn the Oswald case, two items were scrutinized because they were potentially indicative of a dual filing system. The first was a photograph of Oswald that had been taken in Minsk in 1961; the second was a copy of a letter that had been written to Oswald by his mother during his stay in the Soviet Union. At the time of President Kennedy's assassination, both of these items were in the CIA's possession, but neither was in Oswald's 201 file.\nThe photograph of Oswald taken in Minsk shows him posing with several other people. According to the CIA, the picture was found after the assassination as a result of a search of the Agency's graphics files for materials potentially relevant to Oswald's stay in the Soviet\n12ZR Rifle was an executive action (assassination of foreign leader) program unrelated to the Oswald case. Former CIA Director Helms testified that the assassination aspect of ZR Rifle was never implemented and, in fact, was discontinued as soon as it was brought to his attention. (63)\nPage 205\nUnion.(64) The Agency advised that this photograph, as well as several others not related to Oswald, were routinely obtained in 1962 from some tourists by the CIA's Domestic Contacts Division, an Agency component that regularly sought information on a nonclandestine basis from Americans traveling abroad in Communist countries. (65)\nCommittee interviews with the tourists in question confirmed that the photograph, along with 159 other photographic slides, had routinely been made available to the Domestic Contacts Division. Neither tourist had heard of Oswald prior to the assassination or knew which photographs had been of interest to the Agency. (66)\nCIA records indicate that only 5 of the 160 slides initially made available were retained. (67) Committee interviews with the two CIA employees who had handled the slides for the Domestic Contacts Division established that Oswald had not been identified at the time that these photographic materials were made available.(68) One of these employees stated that the Oswald picture had been retained because it depicted a Soviet Intourist guide; the other employee indicated that the picture had been kept because it showed a crane in the background.(69) Of these two employees, the one who worked at CIA headquarters (and therefore was in a position to know) indicated that the photograph of Oswald had not been discovered until a post-assassination search of the Minsk graphics file for materials pertaining to Oswald. (70)\nAccordingly, this photograph was not evidence that the CIA maintained a dual filing system with respect to Oswald. The picture apparently was kept in a separate file until 1964, when Oswald was actually identified to be one of its subjects.\nThe committee's investigation of a copy of a letter to Oswald from his mother that was in the Agency's possession similarly did not show any evidence of a dual filing system. This letter, dated July 6, 1961 and sent by Marguerite Oswald, was intercepted as a result of a CIA program (71) known as HT-Lingual,13 the purpose of which was to obtain intelligence and counterintelligence information from letters sent between the United States and Russia. Typically, intercepted letters and envelopes would be photographed and then returned to the mails.(72)\nIn response to a committee inquiry, the CIA explained that because of HT-Lingual's extreme sensitivity, all materials generated as a result of mail intercepts were stored in a separate project file that was maintained by the counterintelligence staff.(73) Consequently, such items were not placed in 201 files. This explanation was confirmed by the testimony of a senior officer from the counterintelligence staff who had jurisdiction over the HT-Lingual project files 14(74)\nTop of Page\n(10) Did Oswald ever participate in a CIA counterintelligence project?-- The committee's review of HT-Lingual files pertaining to\n13The HT-Lingual program was no longer in effect in 1978. Prior to that time, it had been found to be illegal\n14Since Oswald was known to have sent or received more than 50 communications during his stay in the Soviet Union, the committee also questioned why the Agency ostensibly had just one letter in its possession directly related to Oswald. In essence, the Agency's response suggested that HT-Lingual only operated 4 days a week, and, even then, proceeded on a sampling basis.\nPage 206\nthe Oswald case 15 resulted in the discovery of reproductions of four index cards, two with reference to Lee Harvey Oswald and two to Marina Oswald, which were dated after the assassination of President Kennedy. The pages containing the reproductions of these cards were stamped \"Secret Eyes Only.\" (75)\nThe first card regarding Lee Harvey Oswald, dated November 9, 1959, states that Oswald is a recent defector to the U.S.S.R. and a former marine. It also bears the notation \"CI/Project/RE\" and some handwritten notations. (76) The second card on Oswald places him in Minsk. It contains background information on him and states that he \"reportedly expresses a desire for return to the United States under certain conditions.\" This card is dated August 7, 1961, and also bears the notation \"Watch List.\" (77) These cards, particularly the reference to \"CI/Project/RE,\" raised the question of whether Oswald was, in fact, involved in some sort of counterintelligence project for the CIA.\nThe committee questioned former employees of the CIA who may have had some knowledge pertaining to the HT-Lingual project in general and these cards in particular. Some of these employees recognized the cards as relating to the HT-Lingual project, but were unable to identify the meaning of the notation, \"CI/Project/RE.\" (78)\nOne employee, however, testified that the \"CI Project\" was \"simply a name of convenience that was used to describe the HT-Lingual project\"; (79) another testified that \"CI Project\" was the name of the component that ran the HT-Lingual project. This person also explained that \"RE\" represented the initials of a person who had been a translator of foreign language documents and that the initials had probably been placed there so that someone could come back to the translator if a question arose concerning one of the documents.(80) Another employee indicated that the \"Watch List\" notation on the second card referred to persons who had been identified as being of particular interest with respect to the mail intercept program. (81)\nThe committee requested the CIA to provide an explanation for the terms \"CI/Project/RE\" and \"Watch List\" and for the handwritten notations appearing on the index cards. In addition, the committee requested a description of criteria used in compiling a \"Watch List?\"\nWith respect to the meaning of the notation \"CI/Project/RE,\" the CIA explained that there existed an office within the counterintelligence staff that was known as \"CI/Project,\" a cover title that had been used to hide the true nature of the office's functions. In fact, this office was responsible for the exploitation of the material produced by the HT-Lingual project. The Agency further explained that \"RE\" represented the initials of a former employee. (82)\nIn responding to a request for the criteria used in compiling a \"Watch List,\" the CIA referred to a section of the \"Report to the President by the Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States,\" which states:\n15Although the Agency had only one Oswald letter in its possession, the HT-Lingual files were combed after the assassination for additional materials potentially related to him. Approximately 30 pieces of correspondence that were considered potentially related to the investigation of Oswald's case (even though not necessarily directly related to Oswald) were discovered. None of these was ultimately judged by the CIA to be of any significance. These materials, however, were stored in a separate Oswald HT-Lingual file.\nPage 207\nIndividuals or organizations of particular intelligence interest (one should also add counterintelligence interest) were specified in watch lists provided to the mail project by the counterintelligence staff, by other CIA components, and by the FBI. The total number of names on the Watch List varied, from time to time, but on the average, the list included approximately 300 names, including about 100 furnished by the FBI. The Watch List included the names of foreigners and of U.S. citizens. (83)\nThus, the full meaning of the notation is that on November 9, 1959, an employee whose initials were RE placed Oswald's name on the \"Watch List\" for the HT-Lingual project for the reason stated on the card--that Oswald was a recent defector to the U.S.S.R. and a former Marine.(84)\nThe response went on to state that the handwritten number, No. 7-305, which also appears on the first card, is a reference to the communication from the CI staff to the Office of Security, expressing the CI staff's interest in seeing any mail to or from Oswald in the Soviet Union. Finally, the other handwritten notation, \"N/R-RI, 20 Nov. 59\" signifies that a name trace run through the central records register indicates that there was no record for Lee Oswald as of that date.16(85)\nThe Agency's explanation of the meaning of the second card was that on August 7, 1961, the CIA staff officer who opened the Oswald 201 file requested that Oswald's name be placed on the \"Watch List\" because of Oswald's expressed desire to return to the United States, as stated on the card. The handwritten notation indicates, in this instance, that Oswald's name was deleted from the \"Watch List\" on May 28, 1962.(86)\nWith reference to the two cards on Marina Oswald, the Agency stated that her name was first placed on the \"Watch List\" on November 26, 1963, because she was the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald. The second card served the purpose of adding the name Marina Oswald Porter to the \"Watch List\" on June 29, 1965, after she had remarried. Both names were deleted from the list as of May 26, 1972. (87)\nThus the statements of former CIA employees were corroborated by the Agency's response regarding the explanation of the index cards in the CIA's HT-Lingual files pertaining to Oswald. The explanations attested that the references on the cards were not demonstrative of an Agency relationship with Oswald, but instead were examples of notations routinely used in connection with the HT-Lingual project.\nTop of Page\n(11) Did the CIA ever debrief Oswald?--The CIA has denied ever having had any contact with Oswald,(88) and its records are consistent with this position. Because the Agency has a Domestic Contacts Division that routinely attempts to solicit information on a nonclandestine basis from Americans traveling abroad,(89) the absence of any record indicating that Oswald, a returning defector who had worked in a Minsk radio factory, had been debriefed has been con-\n16This, of course, is contrary to the Agency's record that indicates the receipt of a telegram concerning Oswald on Oct. 31, 1959, and of two telegrams from the Navy concerning him on Nov. 3 and 4, 1959.\nPage 208\nsidered by Warren Commission critics to be either inherently unbelievable (that is, the record was destroyed) or indicative that Oswald had been contacted through other than routine Domestic Contact Division channels. (90)\nAfter reviewing the Agency's records pertaining to this issue, the committee interviewed the former chief of an Agency component responsible for research related to clandestine operations within the Soviet Union. He had written a November 25, 1963, memorandum indicating that, upon Oswald's return from the Soviet Union, he had considered \"the laying of interviews [on him] through the [Domestic Contacts Division] or other suitable channels.\"17(91) The officer indicated that Oswald was considered suspect because the Soviets appeared to have been very solicitous of him. For this reason, a nonclandestine contact, either by the Domestic Contacts Division or other \"suitable channels\" such as the FBI or the Immigration and Naturalization Service, was considered.(92) The officer stated, however, that to his knowledge no contact with Oswald was ever made. Moreover, if a debriefing had occurred, the officer stated that he would have been informed. Finally, he said that Oswald was considered a potential lead, but only of marginal importance, and therefore the absence of a debriefing was not at all unusual. (93)\nThe committee interviewed five other Agency employees who were in a position to have discussed Oswald in 1962 with the author of this memorandum, including the person who replaced the author of the memorandum as chief of the research section. None of them could recall such a discussion.(94) Interviews with personnel from the Soviet Russia Division's clandestine operations section, the visitors program and the clandestine activity research section failed to result in any evidence suggesting that Oswald had been contacted at any time by the CIA.(96)\nThe author of the November 25, 1963, memorandum also informed the committee that the CIA maintained a large volume of information on the Minsk radio factory in which Oswald had worked. This information was stored in the Office of Research and Reports.(96)\nAnother former CIA employee, one who had worked in the Soviet branch of the Foreign Documents Division of the Directorate of Intelligence in 1962, advised the committee that he specifically recalled collecting intelligence regarding the Minsk radio plant. In fact, this individual claimed that during the summer of 1962 he reviewed a contact report from representatives of a CIA field office who had interviewed a former marine who had worked at the Minsk radio plant following his defection to the U.S.S.R. This defector, whom the employee believed may have been Oswald, had been living with his family in Minsk. (97)\nThe employee advised the committee that the contact report had been filed in a volume on the Minsk radio plant that should be retrievable from the Industrial Registry Branch, then a component of the Office of Central Reference. Accordingly, the committee requested that the CIA provide both the contact report and the volume of ma-\n17The November 25, 1963 memorandum indicates that the possibility of an Oswald contact was discussed during the summer of 1960, but the author indicated that the conversation actually took place during the summer of 1962, shortly before his transfer to a new assignment. During the summer of 1960, the author was not on active assignment.\nPage 209\nterials concerning the Minsk radio plant. A review by the committee of the documents in the volumes on the Minsk radio plant, however, failed to locate any such contact report. (98)\nSince the Minsk radio plant seemed to be a logical subject of CIA concern, the committee theorized that questions about it would have been included in the debriefing of defectors. The committee therefore asked the Agency for a statement regarding its procedures for debriefing defectors. In response, the CIA stated that between 1958 and 1963 it had no procedure for systematically debriefing overseas travelers, including returning defectors. Instead, the Agency relied upon the FBI both to make such contacts and report any significant results.(99)\nTo investigate this question further, the committee reviewed the files of 22 other defectors to the Soviet Union (from an original list of 380) who were born in America and appeared to have returned to the United States between 1958 and 1963.18 Of these 22 individuals, only 4 were interviewed at any time by the CIA. These four instances tended to involve particular intelligence or counterintelligence needs, but this was not always the case. (100)\nBased on this file review, it appeared to the committee that, in fact, the CIA did not contact returning defectors in 1962 as a matter of standard operating procedure. For this reason, the absence of any Agency contact with Oswald on his return from the Soviet Union could not be considered unusual, particularly since the FBI did fulfill its jurisdictional obligation to conduct defector interviews.(101)\nTop of Page\n(12) The Justice Department's failure to prosecute Oswald.-- When Oswald appeared at the U.S. Embassy on October 31, 1959, to renounce his American citizenship, he allegedly threatened to give the Soviets information he had acquired as a Marine Corps radar operator.(102) The committee sought to determine why the Justice Department did not prosecute Oswald on his return to the United States for his offer to divulge this kind of information.\nA review of Oswald's correspondence with the American Embassy in Moscow indicates that on February 13, 1961, the embassy received a letter in which Oswald expressed a \"desire to return to the United States if ...some agreement [could be reached] concerning the dropping of any legal proceedings against [him].\" (103) On February 28, 1961, the embassy sought guidance from the State Department concerning Oswald's potential liability to criminal prosecution.(104)\nThe State Department, however, responded on April 13, 1961, that it was not in a position to advise Mr. Oswald whether upon his desired return to the United States he may be amenable to prosecution for any possible offenses committed in violation of the laws of the United States....(105)\nIn May 1961 Oswald wrote the embassy demanding a \"full guarantee\" against the possibility of prosecution.(106) He visited with Embassy Consul Richard Snyder on July 16, 1961, and denied that he had ever given any information to the Soviets. (107) Snyder advised\n18An effort was made to review only the files of those who had defected between 1958 and 1963. Not all of the 22 defectors, however, met this criterion.\nPage 210\nOswald on an informal basis that, while no assurances could be given, the embassy did not perceive any basis for prosecuting him. (108)\nThere is no record that the State Department ever gave Oswald any assurances that he would not be prosecuted. Upon his return to the United States, Oswald was interviewed twice by the FBI. On each occasion, he denied ever having given information to the Soviet Union. (109)\nIn response to a committee request, the Department of Justice indicated that prosecution of Oswald was never considered because his file contained no evidence that he had ever revealed or offered to reveal national defense information to the Soviet Union.(110) In a subsequent response, the Department acknowledged the existence of some evidence that Oswald had offered information to the Soviet Union, but stated that there were, nevertheless, serious obstacles to a possible prosecution:\nIt [the Department file] does contain a copy of an FBI memorandum, dated July 3, 1961, which is recorded as having been received in the Justice Department's Internal Security Division on December 10, 1963, which states that the files of the Office of Naval Intelligence contained a copy of a Department of State telegram, dated October 31, 1959, at Moscow. The telegram, which is summarized in the FBI report, quoted Oswald as having offered the Soviets any information he had acquired as a radar operator. The FBI report did not indicate that the information to which Oswald had access as a radar operator was classified.Page 211\nOswald returned to the United States on June 13, 1962. He was interviewed by the FBI on June 26, 1962, at Fort Worth, Tex., at which time he denied furnishing any information to the Soviets concerning his Marine Corps experiences. He stated that he never gave the Soviets any information which would be used to the detriment of the United States.\nIn sum, therefore, the only \"evidence\" that Oswald ever offered to furnish information to the Soviets is his own reported statement to an official at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. That statement, of course, was contradicted by his denial to the FBI, upon his return to the United States, that he had ever made such an offer.\nIn the prosecution of a criminal case, the Government cannot establish a prima facie case solely on a defendant's unsupported confession. The Government must introduce substantial independent evidence which would tend to establish the trustworthiness of the defendant's statement. See, Opper v. United States 348 U.S. 84 (1954).\nAccordingly, in the absence of any information that Oswald had offered to reveal classified information to the Soviets, and lacking corroboration of his statement that he had proferred information of any kind to the Russians, we did not consider his prosecution for violation of the espionage statutes 18 U.S.C. 793, 794. (111)\nBased upon this analysis, the committee could find no evidence that Oswald received favorable treatment from either the State Department or the Justice Department regarding the possibility of criminal prosecution.\nTop of Page\n(13) Oswald's trip to Russia via London to Helsinki has been a a visa in 2 days.--Oswald's trip from London to Helsinki has been a point of controversy. His passport indicates he arrived in Finland on October 10, 1959. The Torni Hotel in Helsinki, however, had him registered as a guest on that date, although the only direct flight from London to Helsinki landed at 11:33 p.m. that day. According to a memorandum signed in 1964 by Richard Helms, \"[i]f Oswald had taken this flight, he could not normally have cleared customs and landing formalities and reached the Torni Hotel downtown by 2400 (midnight) on the same day.\" (112) Further questions concerning this segment of Oswald's trip have been raised because he had been able to obtain a Soviet entry visa within only 2 days of having applied for it on October 12, 1959.(113) 19\nThe committee was unable to determine the circumstances surrounding Oswald's trip from London to Helsinki. Louis Hopkins, the travel agent who arranged Oswald's initial transportation from the United States, stated that he did not know Oswald's ultimate destination at the time that Oswald booked his passage on the freighter Marion Lykes.(114) Consequently, Hopkins had nothing to do with the London-to-Helsinki leg of Oswald's trip. In fact, Hopkins stated that had he known Oswald's final destination, he would have suggested sailing on another ship that would have docked at a port more convenient to Russia.(115) Hopkins indicated that Oswald did not appear to be particularly well-informed about travel to Europe. The travel agent did not know whether Oswald had been referred to him by anyone.(116).\nA request for any CIA and Department of Defense files on Louis Hopkins resulted in a negative response. The committee was unable to obtain any additional sources of information regarding Oswald's London-to-Helsinki trip.\nThe relative ease with which Oswald obtained his Soviet Union entry visa was more readily amenable to investigation. This issue is one that also had been of concern to the Warren Commission.(117) In a letter to the CIA dated May 25, 1964, J. Lee Rankin inquired about the apparent speed with which Oswald's Soviet visa had been issued. Rankin noted that he had recently spoken with Abraham Chayes, legal adviser to the State Department, who maintained that at the time Oswald received his visa to enter Russia from the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki, normally at least 1 week would elapse between the time of a tourist's application and the issuance of a visa. Rankin contended that if Chayes assessment was accurate, then Oswald's ability to obtain his tourist visa in 2 days might have been significant. (118)\nThe CIA responded Rankin that the Soviet Consulate in Helsinki 1964. Helms wrote to Rankin that the Soviet Consulate in Helsinki\n19Since Oswald arrived in Helsinki on October 10, 1959, which was a Saturday, it is assumed that his first opportunity to apply for a visa would have been on Monday, October 12\nPage 212\nwas able to issue a transit visa (valid for 24 hours) to U.S. businessmen within 5 minutes, but if a longer stay were intended, at least 1 week was needed to process a visa application and arrange lodging through Soviet Intourist. (119) A second communication from Helms to Rankin, dated September 14, 1964, added that during the 1964 tourist season, Soviet consulates in at least some Western European cities issued Soviet tourist visas in from 5 to 7 days. (120)\nIn an effort to resolve this issue, the committee reviewed classified information pertaining to Gregory Golub, who was the Soviet Consul in Helsinki when Oswald was issued his tourist visa. This review revealed that, in addition to his consular activities, Golub was suspected of having been an officer of the Soviet KGB. Two American Embassy dispatches concerning Golub were of particular significance with regard to the time necessary for issuance of visas to Americans for travel into the Soviet Union. The first dispatch recorded that Golub disclosed during a luncheon conversation that:\nMoscow had given him the authority to give Americans visas without prior approval from Moscow. He [Golub] stated that this would make his job much easier, and as long as he was convinced the American was \"all right\" he could give him a visa in a matter of minutes...(121)The second dispatch, dated October 9, 1959, 1 day prior to Oswald's arrival in Helsinki, illustrated that Golub did have the authority to issue visas without delay. The dispatch discussed a telephone contact between Golub and his consular counterpart at the American Embassy in Helsinki:\n...Since that evening [September 4, 1959] Golub has only phoned [the U.S. consul] once and this was on a business matter. Two Americans were in the Soviet Consulate at the time and were applying for Soviet visas thru Golub. They had previously been in the American consulate inquiring about the possibility of obtaining a Soviet visa in 1 or 2 days. [The U.S. Consul] advised them to go directly to Golub and make their request, which they did. Golub phoned [the U.S. Consul] to state that he would give them their visas as soon as they made advance Intourist reservations. When they did this, Golub immediately gave them their visas ....20(122)Thus, based upon these two factors, (1) Golub's authority to issue visas to Americans without prior approval from Moscow, and (2) a demonstration of this authority, as reported in an embassy dispatch approximately 1 month prior to Oswald's appearance at the Soviet Embassy, the committee found that the available evidence tends to support the conclusion that the issuance of Oswald's tourist visa within 2 days after his appearance at the Soviet Consulate was not indicative of an American intelligence agency connection. 21\n20Evidently Oswald had made arrangements with Intourist. On his arrival at the Moscow railroad station on October 16, he was met by an Intourist representative and taken to the Hotel Berlin where he registered as a student (123)\n21If anything, Oswald's ability to receive a Soviet entry visa so quickly was more indicative of a Soviet interest in him.\nPage 213\nTop of Page\n(14) Oswald's contact with Americans in the Soviet Union.-- Priscilla Johnson McMillan, author of Marina and Lee,\" became a subject of the committee's inquiry because she was one of two American corespondents who had obtained an interview with Oswald during his stay in Moscow in 1959. The committee sought to investigate an allegation that her interview with Oswald may have been arranged by the CIA.(124)\nJohn McVickar, a consul at the American Embassy, testified that he had discussed Oswald's case with McMillan, and that he thought \"...she might help us in communicating with him and help him in dealing with what appeared to be a very strong personal problem if she were able to talk with him.\"(125) McVickar stated, however, that he had never worked in any capacity for the CIA, nor did he believe that McMillan had any such affiliation.(126) McVickar's State Department and CIA files were consistent with his testimony that he had never been associated with the CIA.\nMcMillan gave the following testimony about the events surrounding her interview with Oswald. In November 1959 she had returned from a visit to the United States where she covered the Camp David summit meeting between President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev. On November 16, 1959, she went to the American Embassy to pick her mail for the first time since her return to the Soviet Union. The mail pickup facility was in a foyer near the consular office. Consular Officer John A. McVickar came out of this office and welcomed McMillan back to the Soviet Union. They exchanged a few words, and, as she was leaving, McVickar commented that at her hotel was an American who was trying to defect to the Soviet Union. McVickar stated that the American would not speak to \"any of us,\" but he might speak to McMillan because she was a woman. She recalled that as she was leaving, McVickar told her to remember that she was an American.(127)\nMcMillan proceeded to her hotel, found out the American's room number, knocked on his door and asked him for an interview. The American, Lee Harvey Oswald, did not ask her into the room, but he did agree to talk to her in her room later that night. (128) No American Government official arranged the actual interview. McMillan met with Oswald just once. She believed that McVickar called her on November 17, the day after the interview, and asked her to supper. That evening they discussed the interview. McVickar indicated a general concern about Oswald and believed that the attitude of another American consular official might have pushed Oswald further in the direction of defection. McVickar indicated a personal feeling that it would be a sad thing for Oswald to defect in view of his age, but he did not indicate that this was the U.S. Government's position. (129)\nMcMillan also testified that she had never worked for the CIA, nor had she been connected with any other Federal Government agency at the time of her interview with Oswald. (130) According to an affidavit that McMillan filed with the committee, her only employment with the Federal Government was as a 30-day temporary translator. (131).\nFinally, McMillan testified that because of her background in Russian studies, she applied for a position with the CIA in 1952 as an\nPage 214\nintelligence analyst. The application, however, was withdrawn.(132) She acknowledged having been debriefed by an Agency employee in 1962 after returning from her third trip to the Soviet Union, but explained that this contact was in some way related to the confiscation of her notes by Soviet officials. (133)22\nThe committee's review of CIA files pertaining to Ms. McMillan corroborated her testimony. There was no indication in these files suggesting that she had ever worked for the CIA. In fact, the Agency did not even debrief her after her first two trips to the Soviet Union. An interview with the former Agency official who had been deputy chief and then chief of the visitors program during the years 1958 to 1961 similarly indicated that McMillan had not been used by the CIA in the program. (134)\nThere was information in McMillan's file indicating that on occasion during the years 1962-65 she had provided cultural and literary information to the CIA. None of this information was, however, suggestive in any way of a clandestine relationship. Accordingly, there was no evidence that McMillan ever worked for the CIA or received the Agency assistance in obtaining an interview with Oswald.23\nRichard E. Snyder was the consular official in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow who handled the Oswald case. It was Snyder with whom Oswald had met in 1959 when he sought to renounce his American citizenship.(135) Two years later, when Oswald initiated his inquiries about returning to the United States, Snyder again became involved in the case.(136) Warren Commission critics have alleged that Snyder was associated in some way with the CIA during his service in the Moscow Embassy.(137)\nIn his committee deposition, Richard Snyder acknowledged that for a 11-month period during 1949-50 he worked for the CIA while he was on the waiting list for a foreign service appointment with the State Department. (138) Snyder testified, however, that since resigning from the CIA in March 1950, he had had no contact with the other than a letter written in 1970 or 1971 inquiring about employment on a contractual basis. (139)24\nThe committee reviewed Snyder's files at the State Department, Defense Department and the CIA. Both the State Department and Defense Department files are consistent with his testimony. Snyder's CIA file revealed that, at one time prior to 1974, it had been red flagged and maintained on a segregated basis. The file contained\n22In her affidavit McMillan discussed the circumstances surrounding this encounter in some detail: \"In November 1962, I had a conversation with a man who identified himself as a CIA employee...I agreed to see him in part because the confiscation of my papers and notes had utterly altered my situation-- I now had no hope of returning to the U.S.S.R. and was free for the first time to write what I knew. I was preparing a series of articles for The Reporter which would contain the same information about which [the CIA employee] had expressed a desire to talk to me. Finally, during the latter part of my 1962 trip to the U.S.S.R., I had been under heavy surveillance and the KGB knew what Soviet citizens I had seen. Many of those I had talked to for the Reporter articles were Russian \"liberals\" (anti-Stalin and pro-Khrushchev). What reprisals might befall those whom I had interviewed I did not know, but since my notes were now part of the KGB files, I felt that it might help them if the CIA knew that which the KGB already knew. My meeting with-- the CIA employee-- which occurred at the Brattle Inn, Cambridge, was a reversal of my usual effort to avoid contact with the CIA, and the subject matter was confined to my impressions of the Soviet literary and cultural climate.\"\n23Nor was there any basis, based on McMillan's testimony, CIA files or evidence provided by McMillan's publisher, Harper and Row, to support the allegation that the CIA financed or was otherwise involved in publishing \"Marina and Lee.\"\n24Snyder also denied contact with any other intelligence service while active as a foreign service officer.\nPage 215\nrouting indicator that stated that the file had been red flagged because of a \"DCI [Director of Central Intelligence] statement and a matter of cover\" concerning Snyder.(140)\nIn response to a committee inquiry, the CIA indicated that the DCI statement presumably refers to comments which former Director Richard Helms had made in 1964 concerning the Oswald case, when Helms was Deputy Director for Plans25 The CIA also stated that Snyder's file had been flagged at the request of DDO/CI (Directorate of Operations/Central Intelligence) to insure that all inquiries concerning Snyder would be referred to that office. The Agency was unable to explain the reference to \"cover,\" because, according to its records, Snyder had never been assigned any cover while employed. Further, the Agency stated that \"[t]here is no record in Snyder's official personnel file that he ever worked, directly or indirectly, in any capacity for the CIA after his resignation on 26 September 1950.\"\nThe committee did not regard this explanation as satisfactory, especially since Snyder's 201 file indicated that for approximately 1 year during 1956-57 he had been used by an Agency case officer as a spotter at a university campus because of his access to others who might be going to the Soviet Union, nor was the Agency able to explain specifically why someone considered it necessary to red flag the Snyder file.\nThe remainder of the Snyder file, however, is consistent, with his testimony before the committee concerning the absence of Agency contacts. In addition, the CIA personnel officer who handled Snyder's case in 1950 confirmed that Snyder had, in fact, terminated his employment with the CIA at that time. Moreover, he added that Snyder had gone to the State Department as a bona fide employee without any CIA ties. (143) This position was confirmed by a former State Department official who was familiar with State Department procedures regarding CIA employees. In addition, this individual stated that at no time from 1959 to 1963 did the CIA use the State Department's overseas consular positions as cover for CIA intelligence officers. (144)\nThe CIA's failure to explain adequately the red-flagging of Snyder's file was extremely troubling to the committee. Even so, based on Snyder's sworn testimony, the review of his file and the statements of his former personnel officer, a finding that he was in contact with Oswald on behalf of the CIA was not warranted.\nDr. Alexis H. Davison was the U.S. Embassy physician in Moscow from May 1961 to May 1963. In May 1963, the Soviet Union declared him persona non grata in connection with his alleged involvement in the Penkovsky case. (145) After the assassination of President Kennedy, it was discovered that the name of Dr. Davison's mother, Mrs. Hal Davison, and her Atlanta address were in Oswald's address book under the heading \"Mother of U.S. Embassy Doctor.\"(146) In addition, it was determined that the flight that Oswald, his wife and child took from New York to Dallas on June 14, 1962, had stopped in Atlanta. (147) For this reason, it has been alleged that Dr. Davison was Oswald's intelligence contact in Moscow. (148)\n25Responding to a newspaper allegation that Oswald had met with CIA representatives in Moscow, Richard Helms wrote a memorandum to the Warren Commission on March 18, 1964, in which he stated the \"desire to state for the record that the allegation carried in this press report is utterly unfounded as far as the CIA is concerned.\" (141)\nPage 216\nIn a committee interview, Dr. Davison stated that he had been a physician in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed in Moscow as the U.S. Embassy physician from May 1961 to May 1963. In this capacity, it was his duty to perform physical examinations on all Soviet immigrants to the United States. He recalled that most of these immigrants were elderly, but he remembers two young women, one who was a mathematics teacher from the south of Russia and one who was married to an American. The individual who was married to the American was frightened by the prospect of going to the United States. She stated that she was going to Texas with her husband. Davison told her that if she and her husband traveled through Atlanta on their way to Texas, his mother, a native-born Russian, would be happy to see her. He gave his mother's name and address in Atlanta to the woman's husband, who was \"scruffy looking.\" This was not an unusual thing to do, since his family had always very hospitable to Russians who visited Atlanta. In retrospect, he assumed that he gave his mother's name and address to either Lee or Marina Oswald, but he was uncertain about this. (149)\nAfter the assassination of President Kennedy, Davison was interviewed first by a Secret Service agent and later by an FBI agent in connection with the entry of his mother's name and address in Oswald's address book. The FBI agent also interviewed Davison's mother, Natalia Alekseevna Davison. Davison indicated that the Secret Service and the FBI were the only Government agencies to interview him about his contact with the Oswalds. (150)\nDavison stated that in connection with his assignment as U.S. Embassy physician in Moscow, he had received some superficial intelligence training. This training mainly involved lectures on Soviet life and instructions on remembering and reporting Soviet names and military activities. (151)\nDavison admitted his involvement in the Penkovsky spy case. During his tour of duty in Moscow, Davison was asked by an Embassy employee, whose name he no longer remembered, to observe a certain lamppost on his daily route between his apartment and the Embassy and to be alert for a signal by telephone. Davison agreed, according to his instructions, if he ever saw a black chalk mark on the lamppost, or if he ever received a telephone call in which the caller blew into the receiver three times, he was to notify a person whose name he also no longer remembered. He was told nothing else about the operation. Davison performed his role for approximately 1 year. On just one occasion, toward the end of his stay in the Soviet Union, he observed the mark on the lamppost and his wife received the telephone signal. As instructed, he reported these happenings. Shortly thereafter, the Soviets reported that they had broken the Penkovsky spying operation. The Soviets declared Davison persona non grata just after he left Moscow, his tour of duty having ended. He did not recall any intelligence debriefings on the Penkovsky case. (152)\nDavison denied under oath participating in any other intelligence work during his tour in Moscow. (153) The deputy chief of the CIA's Soviet Russia clandestine activities section from 1960 to 1962 confirmed Davison's position, characterizing his involvement in the Penkovsky case as a \"one shot\" deal. (154) In addition, a review of Davison's CIA\nPage 217\nand Department of Defense files showed them to be consistent with his committee testimony.\nAccordingly, there was as insufficient evidence for concluding that Dr. Davison was an intelligence contact for Oswald in Moscow.\nTop of Page\n(15) Alleged intelligence contacts after Oswald returned from Russia.--George de Mohrenschildt was an enigmatic man--a geologist-businessman who befriended Oswald in Texas in 1962,(155) thus causing considerable speculation based on the contrasting backgrounds of the two men. De Mohrenschildt, who committed suicide in 1977, was sophisticated and well educated, a man who moved easily among wealthy Texas oilmen and a circle of white Russians in Dallas many of whom were avowed conservatives. Oswald, because of his background and his Marxist ideological positions, was shunned by most of the people de Mohrenschildt counted among his friends.\nIn his Warren Commission testimony, de Mohrenschildt stated that he believed he had discussed Oswald with J. Walton Moore, whom he described as \"a Government man--either FBI or Central Intelligence.\"(156) He said that Moore was known as the head of the FBI in Dallas and that Moore had interviewed him in 1957 when he returned from a trip to Yugoslavia. (157) De Mohrenschildt indicated that he had asked Moore and Fort Worth attorney Max Clark about. Oswald, to reassure himself that it was \"safe\" for the de Mohrenschildts to assist him and was told by one of these persons, \"The guy seems to be OK\"(158) This admitted association with J. Walton Moore, an employee of the CIA, gave rise to the question of whether de Mohrenschildt had contacted Oswald on behalf of the CIA. (159)\nIn 1963 J. Walton Moore was employed by the CIA in Dallas in the Domestic Contacts Division. (160) According to Moore's CIA personnel file, he had been assigned to the division in 1948. During the period April 1, 1963, to March 31, 1964, he was an overt CIA employee assigned to contact persons traveling abroad for the purpose of eliciting information they might obtain. He was not part of a covert or clandestine operation.\nIn an Agency memorandum dated April 13, 1977, contained in deMohrenschildt's CIA file, Moore set forth facts to counter a claim that had been recently made by a Dallas television station that Oswald had been employed by the CIA and that Moore had known him. In that memorandum, Moore was quoted as saying that, according to his records, the last time he had talked with de Mohrenschildt was in the fall of 1961. Moore said that he had no recollection of any conversation with de Mohrenschildt concerning Oswald. The memorandum also said that Moore recalled only two occasions when he had met de Mohrenschildt--first, in the spring of 1958, to discuss a mutual interest in China, and then in the fall of 1961, when de Mohrenschildt and his wife showed films of their Latin American walking trip. (161)\nOther documents in de Mohrenschildt's CIA file, however, indicated more contact with Moore than was stated in the 1977 memorandum. In a memorandum dated May 1, 1964, submitted to the Acting Chief of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA, Moore stated that he had known de Mohrenschildt and his wife since 1957, at which time Moore obtained biographical data on de Mohrenschildt following his trip to Yugoslavia for the International Cooperation Administration. Moore\nPage 218\nalso wrote in that 1964 memorandum that he had seen de Mohrenschildt several times in 1958 and 1959. De Mohrenschildt's CIA file contained several reports submitted by de Mohrenschildt to the CIA on topics concerning Yugoslavia. (162)\nDe Mohrenschildt testified before the Warren Commission that he had never been in any respect an intelligence agent. (163) Further, the committee's interview with Moore and its review of the CIA's Moore and de Mohrenschildt files showed no evidence that de Mohrenschildt had ever been an American intelligence agent. (In this regard, the committee noted that during 1959-63, upon returning from trips abroad, as many as 25,000 Americans annually provided information to the CIA's Domestic Contacts Division on a nonclandestine basis. (164) Such acts of cooperation should not be confused with an actual Agency relationship).26\nPrior to visiting Mexico in September 1963, Oswald applied in New Orleans for a Mexican tourist card. The tourist card immediately preceding his in numerical sequence was issued on September 17, 1963, (167) to William G. Gaudet, a newspaper editor. Two days later, Gaudet departed on a 3- or 4-week trip to Mexico and other Latin American countries.(168) This happened to coincide with Oswald's visit to Mexico City between September 27, 1963, and October 3, 1963.(169) After the assassination, Gaudet advised the FBI during an interview that he had once been employed by the CIA.(170) Speculation about Gaudet's possible relationship with Oswald arose when it was discovered that the Warren Commission Report contained a list, provided by the Mexican Government, purporting to include all individuals who had been issued Mexican tourist cards at the same time as Oswald, a list that omitted Gaudet's name. (171)\nIn a committee deposition, Gaudet testified that his contact with the CIA was primarily as a source of information (obtained during his trips abroad). In addition, he explained that he occasionally performed errands for the Agency. (172) Gaudet stated that his last contact with the CIA was in 1969, although the relationship had never been formally terminated. (173)\nThe committee reviewed Gaudet's CIA file but found neither any record reflecting a contact between him and the Agency after 1961, nor any indication that he had \"performed errands\" for the CIA. A memorandum, dated January 23, 1976, also indicated the absence of any further contact after this time:\nThe Domestic Collections Division (DCD) has an inactive file on William George Gaudet, former editor and publisher of the Latin American Report. The file shows that Gaudet was a source of the New Orleans DCD (Domestic Contacts Division) Resident Office from 1948 to 1955 during which period he provided foreign intelligence information on Latin American political and economic conditions resulting from his extensive travel in South and Central America in pursuit26De Mohrenschildt's file also contains a reference to an occasion when he may have been involved in arranging a meeting between a Haitian bank officer and a CIA or Department of Defense official. (165) The Department of Defense official, when interviewed by the committee, stated that the meeting was arranged by Department of Defense officials and that de Mohrenschildt's presence (in the company of his wife) was unanticipated. (166) The committee did not regard this incident as evidence of a CIA relationship.\nPage 219\nof journalistic interests. The file further indicates that Gaudet was a casual contact of the New Orleans Office between 1955 and 1961 when, at various times, he furnished fragmentary intelligence.(174)\nGaudet said he could not recall whether his trip to Mexico and other Latin American countries in 1963 involved any intelligence-related activity. (175) He was able to testify, however, that during that trip he did not encounter Oswald, whom he had previously observed on occasion at the New Orleans Trade Mart.(176)27 Gaudet stated that he was unaware at the time his Mexican tourist card was issued that it immediately preceded Oswald's, and he could not recall having seen Oswald on that day.(177) Finally, Gaudet said he did not have any information concerning the omission of his name from the list published in the Warren Commission Report. (178)\nBased upon this evidence, the committee did not find a basis for concluding that Gaudet had contacted Oswald on behalf of the CIA. Although there was a conflict between Gaudet's testimony and his CIA file concerning the duration of his Agency contacts as well as the performance of errands, there was no indication from his file or testimony that Gaudet's cooperation involved clandestine activity. Again, it should be stressed that the Domestic Contacts Division, which was the Agency component that was in touch with Gaudet, was not involved in clandestine operations.\nTop of Page\n(16) Alleged intelligence implications of Oswald's military service-- The committee reviewed Oswald's military records because allegations that he had received intelligence training and had participated in intelligence operations during his term of Marine service.(179) Particular attention was given to the charges that Oswald's early discharge from the corps was designed to serve as a cover for an intelligence assignment and that his records reflected neither his true security clearance nor a substantial period of service in Taiwan. These allegations were considered relevant to the question of whether Oswald had been performing intelligence assignments for military intelligence, as well as to the issue of Oswald's possible association with the CIA.\nOswald's Marine Corps records bear no indication that he ever received any intelligence training or performed any intelligence assignments during his term of service. As a Marine serving in Atsugi, Japan, Oswald had a security clearance of confidential, but never received a higher classification.(180) In his Warren Commission testimony, John E. Donovan, the officer who had been in charge of Oswald's crew at the El Toro Marine base in California, stated that all personnel working in the radar center were required to have a minimum security clearance of secret (181) Thus, the allegation has been made that the security clearance of confidential in Oswald's records is inaccurate. The committee however, reviewed files belonging to four enlisted men who had worked with Oswald either in Japan or California and found that each of them had a security clearance of confidential.(182) 28\n27Gaudet testified that he had never met Oswald, although he had known of him prior to the assassination because Oswald had distributed literature near his office. Gaudet stated that on one occasion he observed Oswald speaking to Guy Bannister on a street corner.\n28John E. Donovan, Oswald's commanding officer, did have a security clearance of secret.\nPage 220\nIt has been stated that Oswald claimed to have served in Taiwan. (183) The committee's review of his military records, including unit diaries that were not previously studied by the Warren Commission, indicated, however, that he had not spent substantial time, if any, in Taiwan. These records show that, except for a 3 1/2 month period of service in the Philippines, Oswald served in Japan from September 12, 1957, until November 2, 1958. (184) Although Department of Defense records do indicate that MAG (Marine Air Group) 11, Oswald's unit, was deployed to Taiwan on September 16, 1958, and remained in that area until April 1959, an examination of the MAG 11 unit diaries indicated that Oswald was assigned at that time to a rear echelon unit. (185) The term rear echelon does not, on its face, preclude service with the main unit in Taiwan, but the Department of Defense has specifically stated that \"Oswald did not sail from Yokosuka, Japan on September 16, 1958. He remained aboard NAS Atsugi as part of the MAG-11 rear echelon.\" 29(186)\nOswald's records also reflect that on October 6, 1958, he was transferred within MAG 11 to a Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron subunit in Atsugi, Japan. (187) He reportedly spent the next week in the Atsugi Station Hospital. (188) On November 2, 1958, Oswald left Japan for duty in the United States. (189)\nAccordingly, based upon a direct examination of Oswald's unit diaries, as well as his own-military records, it does not appear that he had spent any time in Taiwan. This finding is contrary to that of the Warren Commission that Oswald arrived with his unit in Taiwan on September 30, 1958, and remained there somewhat less than a week,(190) but the Commission's analysis apparently was made without access to the unit diaries of MAG 11.30\nMoreover, even if Oswald, in fact, did make the trip with his unit to Taiwan, it is clear that any such service there was not for a substantial time. The unit arrived at Atsugi on September 30, 1958, and by November 2, 1958, Oswald had left from Japan to complete his tour of duty in the United States. (191)\nFinally, with one exception, the circumstances surrounding Oswald's rapid discharge from the military do not appear to have been unusual. Oswald was obligated to serve on active duty until December 7, 1959, but on August 17 he applied for a hardship discharge to support his mother. About 2 weeks later the application was approved. (193) 31\nIt appeared that Oswald's hardship discharge application was processed so expeditiously because it was accompanied by all of the necessary documentation. In response to a committee inquiry, the Department of Defense stated that \"... to a large extent, the time involved a processing hardship discharge applications depended on how well the individual member had prepared the documentation needed for\n29This is contrary to statements attributed to Lieutenant Charles R. Rhodes by Edward J. Epstein in his book, \"The Secret World of Lee Harvey Oswald.\" Rhodes maintains, according to Epstein, that Oswald did make the trip with the main unit but was sent back to Japan on October 6, 1958.\n30Similarly, a message sent on November 4, 1959, from the Chief of Naval Operations concerning Oswald, which states that he had \"served with Marine Air Control Squadrons in Japan and Taiwan,\" (191) may have been issued without checking unit diaries which indicated that Oswald had not been so deployed.\n31By September 4, 1959, Oswald had been informed that he would be discharged on September 11, 1959. (194) This explains why he was able to tell passport officials on that day that he expected to depart the United States for Europe on September 21, 1959.\nPage 221\nconsideration of his or her case.\"(195) A review of Oswald's case indicates that his initial hardship discharge application was accompanied by all of the requisite documentation. Oswald had met the, preliminary requirements of having made a voluntary contribution to the hardship dependent (his mother) and of applying for a dependent's quarters allotment 32 to alleviate the hardship. (196) Even though all of the supporting affidavits for the quarters allotment had not been submitted at the time that the hardship discharge application was filed, the endorsements on the application indicated that the reviewing officers were aware that both the requisite voluntary contribution and the application for a quarters allotment had been made. (197) Moreover, that application was accompanied by two letters and two affidavits attesting to Marguerite Oswald's inability to support herself. (198)\nDocuments provided to the committee by the American Red Cross indicate that Oswald had sought its assistance and therefore was probably well advised on the requisite documentation to support his claim.(199) Indeed, Red Cross officials interviewed Marguerite Oswald and concluded that she \"could not be considered employable from an emotional standpoint.\"(200) The Fort Worth Red Cross office indicated a quarters allotment was necessary for Marguerite Oswald, rather than a hardship discharge for Lee, and assisted her in the preparation of the necessary application documents.(201) Nevertheless, Oswald informed the Red Cross office in El Toro, Calif., where he was then stationed, that he desired to apply for a hardship discharge. (202)\nThe unusual aspect of Oswald's discharge application was that, technically, his requisite application for a quarters allowance for his mother should have been disallowed because Marguerite's dependency affidavit stated that Oswald had not contributed any money to her during the preceding year. (203) Even so, the first officer to review Oswald's application noted in his endorsement, dated August 19, 1959, that \"[a] genuine hardship exists in this case, and in my opinion approval of the 'Q' [quarters] allotment will not sufficiently alleviate this situation.\"(204) This quotation suggests the possibility that applications for quarters allotments and hardship discharges are considered independently of one another. In addition, six other officers endorsed Oswald's application.(205) The committee was able to contact three of the seven endorsing officers (one had died); two had no memory of the event,(206) and one could not recall any details. (207) The committee considered their absence of memory to be indicative of the Oswald, case having been handled in a routine manner.\nBased on this evidence, the committee was not able to discern any unusual discrepancies or features in Oswald's military record.\nTop of Page\n(17) Oswald's military intelligence file.--On November 22, 1963, soon after the assassination, Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Jones, operations officer of the U.S. Army's 112th Military Intelligence Group Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Tex. contacted the FBI offices in San Antonio and Dallas and gave those offices detailed information concerning Oswald and A. J. Hidell, Oswald's alleged alias. (208) This information suggested the existence of a military intelli-\n32A dependent's quarters allotment is one that is jointly paid to the dependent by the serviceman and the service.\nPage 222\ngence file on Oswald and raised the possibility that he had intelligence associations of some kind. (209)\nThe committee's investigation revealed that military intelligence officials had opened a file on Oswald because he was perceived as a possible counterintelligence threat. Robert E. Jones testified before the committee that in June 1963 he had been serving as operations officer of the 112th Military Intelligence Group at Fort Sam Houston, Tex. 33 Under the group's control were seven regions encompassing five States: Texas, Louisiana. Arkansas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Jones was directly responsible for counterintelligence operations, background investigations, domestic intelligence and any special operations in this five-State area. (210) He believed that Oswald first came to his attention in mid-1963 through information provided to the 112th MIG by the New Orleans Police Department to the effect that Oswald had been arrested there in connection with Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities. (211) As a result of this information, the 112th Military Intelligence Group took an interest in Oswald as a possible counterintelligence threat.(212) It collected information from local agencies and the military central records facility, and opened a file under the names Lee Harvey Oswald and A.J. Hidell.(213) Placed in this file were documents and newspaper articles on such topics as Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, his travels there, his marriage to a Russian national, his return to the United States, and his pro-Cuba activities in New Orleans.\nJones related that on November 22, 1963, while in his quarters at Fort Sam Houston, he heard about the assassination of President Kennedy. (215) Returning immediately to his office, he contacted MIG personnel in Dallas and instructed them to intensify their liaisons with Federal, State and local agencies and to report back any information obtained. Early that afternoon, he received a telephone call from Dallas advising that an A.J. Hidell had been arrested or had come to the attention of law enforcement authorities. Jones checked the MIG indexes, which indicated that there was a file on Lee Harvey Oswald, also known by the name A. J. Hidell.(216) Pulling the file, he telephoned the local FBI office in San Antonio to notify the FBI that he had some information. (217) He soon was in telephone contact with the Dallas FBI office, to which he summarized the documents in the file. He believed that one person with whom he spoke was FBI Special-Agent-in-Charge J. Gordon Shanklin. He may have talked with the Dallas FBI office more than one time that day. (218)\nJones testified that his last activity with regard to the Kennedy assassination was to write an \"after action\" report that summarized the actions he had taken, the people he had notified and the times of notification. (219) In addition, Jones believed that this \"after action\" report included information obtained from reports filed by the military intelligence agents who performed liaison functions with the Secret Service in Dallas on the day of the assassination. (220) This \"after action\" report was then maintained in the Oswald file.(221) Jones did not contact, nor was he contacted by, any other law enforce-\n33Questions had been raised about the contents of some FBI communications on November 22, 1963, that reflected information allegedly provided by military intelligence. In his testimony, Jones clarified several points and corrected several errors in these communications.\nPage 223\nment or intelligence agencies concerning information that he could provide on Oswald. (222) To Jones' knowledge, neither the FBI nor any law enforcement agency ever requested a copy of the military intelligence file on Oswald. (223) To his surprise, neither the FBI, Secret Service, CIA nor Warren Commission ever interviewed him. (224) No one ever directed him to withhold any information; on the other hand, he never came forward and offered anyone further information relevant to the assassination investigation because he \"felt that the information that [he] had provided was sufficient and ...a matter of record. ...\"(225)\nThe committee found Jones' testimony to be credible. His statements concerning the contents of the Oswald file were consistent with FBI communications that were generated as a result of the information that he initially provided. Access to Oswald's military intelligence file, which the Department of Defense never gave to the Warren Commission, was not possible because the Department of Defense had destroyed the file as part of a general program aimed at eliminating all of its files pertaining to nonmilitary personnel. In response to a committee inquiry, the Department of Defense gave the following explanation for the file's destruction:\n- Dossier AB 652876, Oswald, Lee Harvey, was identified for deletion from IRR (Intelligence Records and Reports) holdings on Julian date 73060 (1 March 1973) as stamped on the microfilmed dossier cover. It is not possible to determine the actual date when physical destruction was accomplished, but is credibly surmised that the destruction was accomplished within a period not greater than 60 days following the identification for deletion. Evidence such as the type of deletion record available, the individual clerk involved in the identification, and the projects in progress at the time of deletion, all indicate the dossier deletion resulted from the implementation of a Department of the Army, Adjutant General letter dated 1 June 1971, subject: Acquisition of Information Concerning Persons and Organizations not Affiliated with the Department of Defense (DOD) (Incl 1). Basically, the letter called for the elimination of files on non-DOD affiliated persons and organizations.\n- It is not possible to determine who accomplished the actual physical destruction of the dossier. The individual identifying the dossier for deletion can be determined from the clerk number appearing on the available deletion record. The number indicates that Lyndall E. Harp was the identifying clerk. Harp was an employee of the IRR from 1969 until late 1973, at which time she transferred to the Defense Investigative Service, Fort Holdbird, Md., where she is still a civil service employee. The individual ordering the destruction or deletion cannot be determined. However, available evidence indicates that the dossier was identified for deletion under a set of criteria applied by IRR clerks to all files. The basis for these criteria were [sic] established in the 1 June 1971 letter. There is no indication that the dossier was specifically identified for review or deletion. All evidence shows that the file was\n- reviewed as part of a generally applied program to eliminate\nany dossier concerning persons not affiliated with DOD.\n- The exact material contained in the dossier cannot be determined at this time. However, discussions with all available persons who recall seeing the dossier reveal that it most probably included: newspaper clippings relating to pro-Cuban activities of Oswald, several Federal Bureau of Investigation reports, and possibly some Army counterintelligence reports. None of the persons indicated that they remember any significant information in the dossier. It should be noted here that the Army was not asked to investigate the assassination. Consequently, any Army-derived information was turned over to the appropriate civil authority.\n- At the time of the destruction of the Oswald dossier, IRR was operating under the records disposal authority contained in the DOD Memorandum to Secretaries of the Military Departments, OASD(A), 9 February 1972, subject: Records Disposal Authority (Incl 2). The memorandum forwards National Archivist disposal criteria which is similar in nature to the requirements outlined in the 1 June 1971 instructions. It was not until 1975 that the Archivist changed the criteria to ensure non-destruction of investigative records that may be of historical value. (226)\nArmy regulations do not require any type of specific order before intelligence files can be destroyed, and none was prepared in connection with the destruction of the Oswald file. As a rule, investigative information on persons not directly affiliated with the Defense Department can be retained in Army files only for short periods of time and in carefully regulated circumstances. The Oswald file was destroyed routinely in accordance with normal files management procedures, as are thousands of intelligence files annually.(227)The committee found this \"routine\" destruction of the Oswald file extremely troublesome, especially when viewed in light of the Department of Defense's failure to make this file available to the Warren Commission. Despite the credibility of Jones' testimony, without access to this file, the question of Oswald's possible affiliation with military intelligence could not be fully resolved. (18) The Oswald photograph in Office of Naval Intelligence files.-- The Office of Naval Intelligence's (ONI) Oswald file contained a photograph of Oswald, taken at the approximate time of his Marine Corps induction. It was contained in an envelope that had on it the language \"REC'D 14 November 1963\" and \"CIA 77978.\" (228) These markings raised the possibility that Oswald had been in some way associated with the CIA.\nIn response to it committee inquiry, the Department of Defense stated that the photograph had been obtained by ONI as a result of\nPage 225\nan October 4, 1963 CIA request for two copies of the most recent photographs of Oswald so that an attempt could be made to verify his reported presence in Mexico City. The requested copies, however, were not made available to the CIA until after the President's assassination.34 Because of the absence of documentation, no explanation could be given for how or when the Office of Naval Intelligence received this particular photograph of Oswald. (229)\nThe committee's review of CIA cable traffic confirmed that cable No. 77978, dated October 24, 1963, was in fact a request for two copies of the Department of the Navy's most recent photograph of Lee Henry [sic] Oswald. Moreover, review of other cable traffic corroborated the Agency's desire to determine whether Lee Harvey Oswald had, in fact, been in Mexico City. (230)\nThe committee concluded, therefore, that the ONI photograph of Oswald bearing a reference to the CIA, was not evidence that Oswald was a CIA agent. Again, however, the destruction of the military file on Oswald prevented the committee from resolving the question of Oswald's possible affiliation with military intelligence.\nTop of Page\n(19) Oswald in Mexico City.--The committee also considered whether Oswald's activities in Mexico City in the fall of 1963 were indicative of a relationship between him and the CIA. This aspect of the committee's investigation involved a complete review both of alleged Oswald associates and of various CIA operations outside of the United States. (231)\nThe committee found no evidence of any relationship between Oswald and the CIA. Moreover, the Agency's investigative efforts prior to the assassination regarding Oswald's presence in Mexico City served to confirm the absence of any relationship with him. Specifically, when apprised of his possible presence in Mexico City, the Agency both initiated internal inquiries concerning his background and, once informed of his Soviet experience, notified other potentially interested Federal agencies of his possible contact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. (232) Conclusion\nBased on the committee's entire investigation, it concluded that the Secret Service, FBI and CIA were not involved in the assassination. The committee concluded that it is probable that the President was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. Nothing in the committee's investigation pointed to official involvement in that conspiracy. While the committee frankly acknowledged that its investigation was not able to identify the members of the conspiracy besides Oswald, or the extent of the conspiracy, the committee believed that it did not include the Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, or Central Intelligence Agency.\n34As noted, the military file on Oswald, presumably including the ONI photograph, was destroyed by the Department of Defense.\nBibliographic note: Web version based on the Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1979. 1 volume, 686 pages.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 49th lieutenant governor of California from 2011 to 2019 and as the 42nd mayor of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011.\nBorn in San Francisco, Newsom graduated from Santa Clara University in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science in political science. Afterward, he founded the boutique winery PlumpJack Group in Oakville, California, with billionaire heir and family friend Gordon Getty as an investor. The company grew to manage 23 businesses, including wineries, restaurants, and hotels. Newsom began his political career in 1996, when San Francisco mayor Willie Brown appointed him to the city's Parking and Traffic Commission.[1] Brown then appointed Newsom to fill a vacancy on the Board of Supervisors the next year and Newsom was first elected to the board in 1998.\nNewsom was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003 and reelected in 2007. He was elected lieutenant governor of California in 2010 and reelected in 2014. As lieutenant governor, Newsom hosted The Gavin Newsom Show from 2012 to 2013 and in 2013 wrote the book Citizenville, which focuses on using digital tools for democratic change.\nNewsom was elected governor of California in 2018. During his tenure, he faced criticism for his personal behavior and leadership style during the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to an unsuccessful recall effort in 2021. Newsom was reelected in 2022. Since 2025, he has hosted the podcast This Is Gavin Newsom, which has featured guests from across the political spectrum.\nEarly life\nGavin Christopher Newsom was born on October 10, 1967, in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (née Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a state appeals court judge and attorney for Getty Oil.[2] A fourth-generation San Franciscan, Newsom comes from a prominent family with deep ties to the city. His maternal great-grandfather Thomas Addis was a pioneering nephrologist and professor of medicine at Stanford University noted for his groundbreaking research on kidney disease.[3] Newsom is a second cousin twice removed of musician Joanna Newsom,[4] and his aunt Barbara Newsom was married to Ron Pelosi, the brother-in-law of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.[5] Newsom's parents divorced in 1971 when he was three years old, leaving his mother, Tessa, to raise him and his younger sister, Hilary Newsom Callan, largely on her own.[6] Tessa worked three jobs—often as a waitress, bookkeeper, and secretary—to support the family, fostering a strong work ethic in her children.[7] Newsom has called his childhood challenging, shaped in part by financial instability and his struggle with \"pretty severe\" dyslexia, a condition he still has.[5]\nNewsom's education began at École Notre Dame des Victoires, a French-American bilingual Catholic school in San Francisco that he attended for kindergarten and first grade. But his severe dyslexia—which affected his ability to read, write, spell, and perform numerical tasks (dyscalculia)—prompted a transfer.[5] He continued at Notre Dame des Victoires from third through fifth grades, where he was enrolled in remedial reading classes to cope with his learning difficulties. Throughout his years in school, Newsom relied heavily on audiobooks, summaries, and verbal instruction. He still prefers audio interpretations of documents and reports.[8] In a 2023 interview, he said his dyslexia \"forced me to find workarounds and think differently—skills I still use every day as governor.\"[9]\nAt Redwood High School in Larkspur, California, Newsom excelled athletically despite his academic struggles, graduating in 1985. He played basketball as a shooting guard and baseball as an outfielder, earning recognition on the cover of the Marin Independent Journal for his skills.[7] His sister Hilary recalled lean Christmases when their mother warned them not to expect gifts, underscoring the family's financial strain.[7] Tessa opened their home to foster children, a practice that Newsom has said instilled in him a lifelong commitment to public service.[7][10] His father's habit of donating much of his income further tightened the family's finances, leading Newsom to take various jobs—such as washing cars and working at a local deli—during high school to help out.[11]\nNewsom enrolled at Santa Clara University on a partial baseball scholarship, graduating in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science in political science. He tried out for the baseball team during his first two years but underwent elbow surgery in late 1985—later revealed as a procedure to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament—ending his varsity aspirations.[12] He has credited the university's Jesuit education with fostering his independent thinking and skepticism of conventional wisdom.[13] During his junior year, Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in Rome, Italy, an experience he called \"eye-opening\" in a 2019 speech, exposing him to global perspectives that influenced his political career.[14]\nBusiness career\nNewsom and his investors created the company PlumpJack Associates L.P. on May 14, 1991. The group started the PlumpJack Winery in 1992 with the financial help of his family friend Gordon Getty.[15][16] PlumpJack was the name of an opera written by Getty, who invested in 10 of Newsom's 11 businesses.[5] Getty told the San Francisco Chronicle that he treated Newsom like a son and invested in his first business venture because of that relationship. According to Getty, later business investments were because of \"the success of the first\".[5]\nOne of Newsom's early interactions with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Department of Public Health's requirement to install a sink at his PlumpJack wine store.[17] The Health Department argued that wine was a food and required the store to install a $2,700 sink in the carpeted wine shop on the grounds that the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed supervisor, he told the San Francisco Examiner: \"That's the kind of bureaucratic malaise I'm going to be working through.\"[18]\nThe business grew to an enterprise with more than 700 employees.[7] The PlumpJack Cafe Partners L.P. opened the PlumpJack Café, also on Fillmore Street, in 1993. Between 1993 and 2000, Newsom and his investors opened several other businesses that included the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn with a PlumpJack Café (1994), a winery in Napa Valley (1995), the Balboa Café Bar and Grill (1995), the PlumpJack Development Fund L.P. (1996), the MatrixFillmore Bar (1998), PlumpJack Wines shop Noe Valley branch (1999), PlumpJackSport retail clothing (2000), and a second Balboa Café at Squaw Valley (2000).[5] Newsom's investments included five restaurants and two retail clothing stores.[7] Newsom's annual income was greater than $429,000 from 1996 to 2001.[5] In 2002, his business holdings were valued at more than $6.9 million.[7] Newsom gave a monthly $50 gift certificate to PlumpJack employees whose business ideas failed, because in his view, \"There can be no success without failure.\"[18]\nNewsom sold his share of his San Francisco businesses when he became mayor in 2004. He maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco, including the PlumpJack Winery in Oakville, California, new PlumpJack-owned Cade Winery in Angwin, California, and the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn. He is the president in absentia of Airelle Wines Inc., which is connected to the PlumpJack Winery in Napa County. Newsom earned between $141,000 and $251,000 in 2007 from his business interests.[19] In February 2006, he paid $2,350,000 for his residence in the Russian Hill neighborhood, which he put on the market in April 2009 for $3,000,000.[20] At the time of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, it was acknowledged that at least three of Newsom's wine companies—PlumpJack, Cade, and Odette—were Silicon Valley Bank clients.[21][22]\nEarly political career\nNewsom's first political experience came when he volunteered for Willie Brown's successful campaign for mayor in 1995. Newsom hosted a private fundraiser at his PlumpJack Café.[5] Brown appointed Newsom to a vacant seat on the Parking and Traffic Commission in 1996, and he was later elected president of the commission. Brown appointed him to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors seat vacated by Kevin Shelley in 1997. At the time, he was the youngest member of San Francisco's board of supervisors.[23][24][25]\nNewsom was sworn in by his father and pledged to bring his business experience to the board.[24] Brown called Newsom \"part of the future generation of leaders of this great city\".[24] Newsom described himself as a \"social liberal and a fiscal watchdog\".[24][25] He was elected to a full four-year term to the board in 1998. San Francisco voters chose to abandon at-large elections to the board for the previous district system in 1999. Newsom was reelected in 2000 and 2002 to represent the second district, which includes Pacific Heights, the Marina, Cow Hollow, Sea Cliff, and Laurel Heights, which had San Francisco's highest income level and highest Republican registration.[26] Newsom paid $500 to the San Francisco Republican Party to appear on the party's endorsement slate in 2000 while running for Supervisor.[27] He was reelected.[28]\nAs a San Francisco Supervisor, Newsom gained public attention for his role in advocating reform of the city's municipal railway (Muni).[29] He was one of two supervisors endorsed by Rescue Muni, a transit riders group, in his 1998 reelection. He sponsored Proposition B to require Muni and other city departments to develop detailed customer service plans.[5][30] The measure passed with 56.6% of the vote.[31] Newsom sponsored a ballot measure from Rescue Muni; a version of the measure was approved by voters in November 1999.[29] Newsom also supported allowing restaurants to serve alcohol at their outdoor tables, banning tobacco advertisements visible from the streets, stiffer penalties for landlords who run afoul of rent-control laws, and a resolution, which was defeated, to commend Colin Powell for raising money for youth programs.[29] Newsom's support for business interests at times strained his relationship with labor leaders.[29]\nDuring Newsom's time as supervisor, he supported housing projects through public-private partnerships to increase homeownership and affordable housing in San Francisco.[32] He supported HOPE, a failed local-ballot measure that would have allowed an increased condo-conversion rate if a certain percentage of tenants within a building were buying their units. As a candidate for mayor, he supported building 10,000 new housing units to create 15,000 new construction jobs.[32] Newsom's signature achievement as a supervisor was a voter initiative called Care Not Cash (Measure N), which offered care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists for the homeless in lieu of direct cash aid from the state's general assistance program.[32] Many homeless rights advocates protested against the initiative. Newsom said: \"Progressives and Democrats, nuns and priests, homeless advocates and homeless people were furious.\"[33] The successfully passed ballot measure raised his political profile and provided the volunteers, donors, and campaign staff that helped make him a leading contender for mayor in 2003.[5][34][35] In a 2008 city audit, the program was evaluated as largely successful for lowering average cash payments per person from over $300 to $78 and the number of people receiving cash payments from over 2,500 to about 640.[36]\nMayor of San Francisco (2004–2011)\nElections\n2003\nNewsom placed first in the November 4, 2003, general election in a nine-person field. He received 41.9% of the vote to Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez's 19.6% in the first round of balloting, but faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff, when many of the city's progressive groups supported Gonzalez.[34] The race was partisan, with attacks against Gonzalez for his support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election, and attacks against Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate mailer in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported.[37][38] Democratic leadership felt they needed to reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the 2003 gubernatorial recall election to Arnold Schwarzenegger.[38] National Democratic Party figures, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson, campaigned for Newsom.[38][39] Five supervisors endorsed Gonzalez, while Willie Brown endorsed Newsom.[34][35]\nNewsom won the runoff with 53% of the vote to Gonzalez's 47%, a margin of 11,000 votes.[34] He ran as a business-friendly centrist Democrat and a moderate in San Francisco politics. Some of his opponents called him conservative.[34][38] Newsom claimed he was a centrist in the Dianne Feinstein mold.[32][40] He ran on the slogan \"great cities, great ideas\", and presented over 21 policy papers.[35] He pledged to continue working on San Francisco's homelessness issue.[34] Newsom was sworn in as mayor on January 8, 2004.[41] He called for unity among the city's political factions, and promised to address the issues of public schools, potholes, and affordable housing.[42] Newsom said he was \"a different kind of leader\" who \"isn't afraid to solve even the toughest problems\".[43]\n2007\nSan Francisco's progressive community tried to field a candidate to run against Newsom. Supervisors Ross Mirkarimi and Chris Daly considered running, but both declined. Gonzalez also decided not to challenge Newsom again.[44] When the August 10, 2007, filing deadline passed, San Francisco's discussion shifted to talk about Newsom's second term. He was challenged in the election by 13 candidates, including George Davis, a nudist activist, and Michael Powers, owner of the Power Exchange sex club.[45] Conservative former supervisor Tony Hall withdrew by early September due to lack of support.[46] The San Francisco Chronicle declared in August 2007 that Newsom faced no \"serious threat to his re-election bid\", having raised $1.6 million for his reelection campaign by early August.[47] He was reelected on November 6 with over 72% of the vote.[48] Upon taking office for a second term, Newsom promised to focus on the environment, homelessness, health care, education, housing, and rebuilding San Francisco General Hospital.[49][50]\nMayoralty\nAs mayor, Newsom focused on development projects in Hunters Point and Treasure Island. He gained national attention in 2004 when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, violating a state law passed in 2000.[51] Implementation of Care Not Cash, the initiative he had sponsored as a supervisor, began on July 1, 2004. As part of the initiative, 5,000 more homeless people were given permanent shelter in the city. About 2,000 people had been placed into permanent housing with support by 2007. Other programs Newsom initiated to end chronic homelessness included the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT) and Project Homeless Connect (PHC), which placed 2,000 homeless people into permanent housing and provided 5,000 additional affordable rental units in the city.[52]\nDuring a strike by hotel workers against a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line in front of the Westin St. Francis Hotel on October 27, 2004. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events at them until they agreed to a contract with workers; the contract dispute was settled in September 2006.[53] In 2005, Newsom pushed for a state law to allow California communities to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs.[54] In 2007, he signed the law establishing Healthy San Francisco to provide city residents with universal health care, the first city in the nation to do so.[52] Newsom came under attack from the San Francisco Democratic Party in 2009 for his failure to implement the City of San Francisco's sanctuary city rule, under which the city was to not assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.[55]\nThe same year, Newsom received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award, along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and three other public officials, for his commitment to making healthful food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families.[56] He hosted the Urban-Rural Roundtable in 2008 to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy, affordable food.[57] Newsom secured $8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program,[58] which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes. He signed a menu-labeling bill into law, requiring that chain restaurants print nutrition information on their menus.[59] Newsom was named \"America's Most Social Mayor\" in 2010 by Same Point, based on analysis of the social media profiles of mayors of the 100 largest U.S. cities.[60]\nSame-sex marriage\nNewsom gained national attention in 2004 when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, violating state law.[51] In August 2004, the Supreme Court of California annulled the marriages Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law. Still, Newsom's unexpected move brought national attention to the issue of same-sex marriage, solidifying political support for him in San Francisco and in the LGBTQ+ community.[11][10][61]\nDuring the 2008 election, Newsom opposed Proposition 8, the ballot initiative to reverse the Supreme Court of California ruling that there was a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.[62] Proposition 8 supporters released a commercial featuring footage of Newsom saying the following in a speech regarding same-sex marriage: \"This door's wide open now. It's going to happen, whether you like it or not.\"[63] Some observers noted that polls shifted in favor of Proposition 8 after the commercial's release; this, in turn, led to speculation that Newsom had inadvertently played a role in the amendment's passage.[63][64][65][66]\nLieutenant governor of California (2011–2019)\nElections\n2010\nNewsom filed initial paperwork to run for lieutenant governor in February 2010,[67] and officially announced his candidacy in March.[68] He received the Democratic nomination in June,[69] and won the election on November 2.[70] Newsom was sworn in as lieutenant governor on January 10, 2011, and served under Governor Jerry Brown. While lieutenant governor, in May 2012, Newsom began hosting The Gavin Newsom Show on Current TV. The same month, he drew criticism for calling Sacramento \"dull\" and saying he was only there once a week, adding, \"there's no reason\" to be there otherwise.[71]\n2014\nNewsom was reelected as lieutenant governor on November 4, 2014, defeating Republican Ron Nehring with 57.2% of the vote. His second term began on January 5, 2015.[72]\nCapital punishment\nNewsom supported a failed measure in 2012 that sought to end capital punishment in California. He claimed the initiative would save California millions of dollars, citing statistics that California had spent $5 billion since 1978 to execute just 13 people.[73] In 2016, Newsom supported Proposition 62, which also would have repealed the death penalty in California.[74] He argued that Prop. 62 would get rid of a system \"that is administered with troubling racial disparities\" and said that the death penalty was fundamentally immoral and did not deter crime.[73] Proposition 62 failed.\nCriminal justice and cannabis legalization\nIn 2014, Newsom was the only statewide politician to endorse California Proposition 47, legislation that recategorized certain nonviolent offenses like drug and property crimes as misdemeanors as opposed to felonies. Voters passed the measure on November 4, 2014.[74] In July 2015, Newsom released the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy's final report, which he had convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013. The report's recommendations to regulate cannabis were intended to inform a legalization measure on the November 2016 ballot.[75] Newsom supported the resulting measure, Proposition 64, which legalized cannabis use and cultivation for California state residents who are 21 or older.[76]\nOn February 24, 2017, in response to pro-enforcement statements by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Newsom sent Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Donald Trump a letter urging them not to increase federal enforcement against recreational cannabis firms opening in California.[76] He wrote: \"The government must not strip the legal and publicly supported industry of its business and hand it back to drug cartels and criminals ... Dealers don't card kids. I urge you and your administration to work in partnership with California and the other eight states that have legalized recreational marijuana for adult use in a way that will let us enforce our state laws that protect the public and our children while targeting the bad actors.\" Newsom responded to comments by Spicer that compared cannabis to opioids: \"Unlike marijuana, opioids represent an addictive and harmful substance, and I would welcome your administration's focused efforts on tackling this particular public health crisis.\"[76]\nEducation\nNewsom joined Long Beach City College Superintendent Eloy Oakley in a November 2015 op-ed calling for the creation of the California College Promise, which would create partnerships between public schools, public universities, and employers and offer a free community college education.[77] Throughout 2016, he joined Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf at the launch of the Oakland Promise and Second Lady Jill Biden and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti at the launch of the LA Promise.[78][79] In June 2016, Newsom helped secure $15 million in the state budget to support the creation of promise programs throughout the state.[80]\nIn December 2015, Newsom called on the University of California to reclassify computer science courses as a core academic class to incentivize more high schools to offer computer science curricula.[81][82] He sponsored successful legislation signed by Governor Brown in September 2016, that began the planning process for expanding computer science education to all state students, beginning as early as kindergarten.[83] In 2016, Newsom passed a series of reforms at the University of California to give student-athletes additional academic and injury-related support, and to ensure that contracts for athletic directors and coaches emphasized academic progress. This came in response to several athletics programs, including the University of California–Berkeley's football team, which had the lowest graduation rates in the country.[84][85]\nTechnology in government\nNewsom released his first book, Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government, on February 7, 2013.[86][87] The book discusses the Gov 2.0 movement taking place across the nation. After its release, Newsom began to work with the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at the University of California, Berkeley, on the California Report Card (CRC).[88] The CRC is a mobile-optimized platform that allows state residents to \"grade\" their state on six timely issues. The CRC exemplifies ideas presented in Citizenville, encouraging direct public involvement in government affairs via technology.[89] In 2015, Newsom partnered with the Institute for Advanced Technology and Public Policy at California Polytechnic State University to launch Digital Democracy, an online tool that uses facial and voice recognition to enable users to navigate California legislative proceedings.[90]\nGubernatorial campaigns (2010–2022)\n2010 election\nOn April 21, 2009, Newsom announced his candidacy for governor of California in the 2010 election.[91] He named state senator (and future U.S. senator) Alex Padilla to chair his campaign.[92] He received former president Bill Clinton's endorsement in September. Throughout the campaign, he had low poll numbers, trailing Democratic frontrunner Jerry Brown by more than 20 points in most polls.[93][94][95] Newsom dropped out of the race in October and ran for lieutenant governor instead.[96][97][98]\n2018 election\nOn February 11, 2015, Newsom announced that he was opening a campaign account for governor in the 2018 elections, allowing him to raise funds for a campaign to succeed Brown as governor of California.[99] On June 5, 2018, he finished in the top two in the nonpartisan blanket primary, and he defeated Republican John H. Cox by a landslide in the November 6 general election.[100]\n2021 recall election\nNewsom was sworn in on January 7, 2019. Several recall attempts were launched against Newsom early in his tenure but failed to gain much traction. On February 21, 2020, a recall petition was introduced by Orrin Heatlie, a deputy sheriff in Yolo County. The petition mentioned Newsom's sanctuary state policy and said laws he endorsed favored \"foreign nationals, in our country illegally\"; said that California had high homelessness, high taxes, and low quality of life; and described other grievances.[101] The California secretary of state approved it for circulation on June 10, 2020.[102]\nForcing the gubernatorial recall election required a total of 1,495,709 verified signatures.[101] By August 2020, 55,000 signatures were submitted and verified by the secretary of state, and 890 new valid signatures were submitted by October 2020.[103] The petition was initially given a signature deadline of November 17, 2020, but it was extended to March 17, 2021, after Judge James P. Arguelles ruled that petitioners could have more time because of the pandemic.[104] Newsom's attendance at a party at The French Laundry in November 2020, despite his public health measures;[105] voter anger over lockdowns, job losses, school and business closures;[106] and a $31 billion fraud scandal at the state unemployment agency[107] were credited for the recall's growing support.[106] The French Laundry event took place on November 6,[108] and between November 5 and December 7 over 442,000 new signatures were submitted and verified; 1,664,010 verified signatures, representing roughly 98% of the final total of 1,719,900, were submitted between November 2020 and March 17, 2021.[103][109]\nDuring the campaign, Newsom compared the recall effort to the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election.[110] On September 14, 2021, the recall election was held, and only 38% voted to recall Newsom, so he remained in office.[111][112]\n2022 election\nIn 2022, Newsom was elected to a second term, defeating Republican state senator Brian Dahle with 59.2% of the vote. This was a smaller margin of victory than in 2018, and the first time since 2010 that the Democratic gubernatorial nominee did not win at least 60% of the vote.[113]\nGovernor of California (2019–present)\n| Part of a series on |\n| Modern liberalism in the United States |\n|---|\nA CalMatters analysis published in 2019 found Newsom's political positions to be more moderate than those of almost every Democratic state legislator in California.[115]\nAppointments\nAfter U.S. Senator Kamala Harris was elected vice president of the United States in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Newsom appointed Secretary of State of California Alex Padilla to succeed her as California's junior U.S. senator. To replace Padilla as secretary of state, Newsom appointed Assemblywoman Shirley Weber.[116][117][118] After the U.S. Senate confirmed Xavier Becerra as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Newsom appointed Rob Bonta Attorney General of California.[119] In an interview with Joy Reid, Newsom was asked whether he would appoint a Black woman to replace Dianne Feinstein if she were to retire from the Senate or die before her term ended in 2024; Newsom replied that he would.[120][121] Feinstein died in September 2023, and Newsom faced pressure to quickly appoint a successor.[122] He fulfilled his promise and appointed Laphonza Butler to the seat.[123]\nCriminal justice\nCapital punishment\nOn March 13, 2019, three years after voters narrowly rejected its repeal in the 2016 California Proposition 62,[124] Newsom declared a moratorium on the state's death penalty, preventing any execution in the state as long as he remained governor. The move also led to the withdrawal of the state's current lethal injection protocol and the execution chamber's closure at San Quentin State Prison.[125] In a CBS This Morning interview, Newsom said that the death penalty is \"a racist system ... that is perpetuating inequality. It's a system that I cannot in good conscience support.\"[126] The moratorium granted a temporary reprieve for all 737 inmates on California's death row, then the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere.[127]\nIn January 2022, Newsom directed the state to begin dismantling its death row in San Quentin, to be transformed into a \"space for rehabilitation programs\",[128] as all the condemned inmates are moving to other prisons that have maximum security facilities. The state's voters upheld capital punishment in 2012 and 2016, with the latter measure agreeing to move the condemned to other prisons.[129] While a 2021 poll by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times suggested declining support for capital punishment among California's voters,[128][130] Republican opponents criticized Newsom's moves to halt capital punishment in California as defiance of the will of voters, and capital punishment advocates said they denied closure to murder victims' families.[128]\nClemency\nIn response to the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants with criminal records, Newsom gave heightened consideration to people in this situation.[131] A pardon can eliminate the grounds for deportation of immigrants who would otherwise be legal permanent residents. Pardon requests from people facing deportation are given expedited review by the state Board of Parole Hearings, per a 2018 California law.[131] In his first acts of clemency as governor, Newsom pardoned seven formerly incarcerated people in May 2019, including two Cambodian refugees facing deportation.[132] He pardoned three men who were attempting to avoid being deported to Cambodia or Vietnam in November 2019. They had separately committed crimes when they were each 19 years old.[133] In December 2019, Newsom granted parole to a Cambodian refugee who had been held in a California prison due to a murder case. Although immigrant rights groups wanted Newsom to end policies allowing the transfer to federal agents, the refugee was turned over for possible deportation upon release.[134]\nOn January 13, 2022, Newsom denied parole to Sirhan Sirhan, Robert F. Kennedy's assassin, who had been recommended for parole by a parole board after serving 53 years in prison.[135] Newsom wrote an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times saying Sirhan \"still lacks the insight that would prevent him from making the kind of dangerous and destructive decisions he made in the past. The most glaring proof of Sirhan's deficient insight is his shifting narrative about his assassination of Kennedy, and his current refusal to accept responsibility for it.\"[136]\nPolice reform\nNewsom has spoken in favor of Assembly Bill 1196, which would ban carotid artery restraints and choke holds in California. He said that there is no longer a place for a policing tactic \"that literally is designed to stop people's blood from flowing into their brain, that has no place any longer in 21st-century practices\".[137][138] Newsom has signed the California Act to Save Lives and California Racial Justice Act of 2020. In September 2021, he signed legislation raising the minimum age to become a police officer from 18 to 21. Also in the bills were restrictions on the use of tear gas and a ban on police departments employing officers after misconduct or crimes. Among the bills was the George Floyd Bill, requiring officers to intervene when witnessing excessive force on the part of another officer.[139]\nNewsom vetoed Assembly Bill 2681 which sought to restrict autonomous weapons citing \"beneficial law enforcement use of such devices\".[140][141] Newsom vetoed Assembly Bill 2632, which sought to limit solitary confinement.[142][143] In October 2024, Newsom vetoed Assembly Bill 2693 whigh sought to change the statute of limitations for those sexually abused in juvenille facilities.[144] In 2025, Newsom vetoed Senate Bill 274, which would have expanded the rules and regulations on law enforcement agencies, in California, use of automated license plate readers. In his veto message, he stated the proposed regulations, which would have required police to better document their searches and delete unused data within 60 days, could hinder police work.[145][146]\nTransgender prisoners\nIn September 2020, Newsom signed into law a bill allowing California transgender inmates to be placed in prisons that correspond with their gender identity. An inmate's request can be denied based on \"management or security concerns\".[147][148] In response, the Women's Liberation Front filed a lawsuit claiming that the bill is \"unconstitutional and creates an unsafe environment for women in female facilities\".[149]\nDisasters and emergencies\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nNewsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020, after the first death in California attributable to the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).[150][151] His stated intention was to help California prepare for and contain COVID-19's spread.[152] The emergency declaration allowed state agencies to more easily procure equipment and services, share information on patients and alleviated restrictions on the use of state-owned properties and facilities. Newsom also announced that mitigation policies for the state's estimated 108,000 unsheltered homeless people would be prioritized, with a significant push to move them indoors.[153]\nNewsom issued an executive order that allowed the state to commandeer hotels and medical facilities to treat COVID-19 patients and permitted government officials to hold teleconferences in private without violating open meeting laws.[154] He also directed local school districts to make their own decisions on school closures, but used an executive order to ensure students' needs would be met whether or not their school was physically open. The U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the Newsom administration's request to offer meal service during school closures, which included families being able to pick up those meals at libraries, parks, or other off-campus locations. Roughly 80% of students at California's public schools receive free or reduced-price meals. This executive order included continued funding for remote learning opportunities and child care options during workday hours.[155]\nAs the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state continued to rise, on March 15, Newsom urged people 65 and older and those with chronic health conditions to isolate themselves from others. He also called on bars and brewery and winery tasting rooms to close their doors to patrons. Some local jurisdictions had mandatory closures.[156] The closures were extended to movie theaters and health clubs. He asked restaurants to stop serving meals inside their establishments and offer take-out meals only.[157] His statewide order to stay at home became mandatory on March 19. It allowed movement outside the home for necessities or recreation, but people were required to maintain a safe distance apart.[158] Activity \"needed to maintain continuity of operation of the federal critical infrastructure sectors, critical government services, schools, childcare, and construction\" was excluded from the order. Essential services such as grocery stores and pharmacies remained open. Newsom provided state funds to pay for protective measures such as hotel room lodging for hospital and other essential workers fearing returning home and infecting family members.[159] By April 26, he had issued 30 executive orders under the state of emergency while the legislature had not been in session.[160]\nOn April 28, Newsom, along with the governors of Oregon and Washington, announced a \"shared approach\" for reopening their economies.[161][162] His administration outlined key indicators for altering his stay-at-home mandate, including the ability to closely monitor and track potential cases, prevent infection of high-risk people, increase surge capacity at hospitals, develop therapeutics, ensure physical distancing at schools, businesses, and child-care facilities, and develop guidelines for restoring isolation orders if the virus surges.[163] The plan to end the shutdown had four phases.[164] Newsom emphasized that easing restrictions would be based on data, not dates, saying, \"We will base reopening plans on facts and data, not on ideology. Not what we want. Not what we hope.\"[165] Of a return of Major League Baseball and the NFL, he said, \"I would move very cautiously in that expectation.\"[166]\nIn early May, Newsom announced that certain retailers could reopen for pickup. Most Californians approved of Newsom's handling of the crisis and were more concerned about reopening too early than too late, but there were demonstrations and protests against these policies.[167] Under pressure, Newsom delegated more decision-making on reopening to the local level.[168] That same month, he announced a plan for registered voters to have the option to vote by mail in the November election.[169] California was the first state in the country to commit to sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters for the November general election.[170]\nAs the state opened up, the Los Angeles Times found that new coronavirus hospitalizations in California began accelerating around June 15 at a rate not seen since early April, immediately after the virus began rapidly spreading in the state.[171] On June 18, Newsom made face coverings mandatory for all Californians in an effort to reduce COVID-19's spread.[172][173] Enforcement would be up to business owners, as local law enforcement agencies view non-compliance as a minor infraction.[174] By the end of June, he had ordered seven counties to close bars and nightspots, and recommended eight other counties take action on their own to close those businesses due to a surge of coronavirus cases in some parts of the state.[175] In a regular press conference on July 13 as he was ordering the reinstatement of the shutdown of bars and indoor dining in restaurants, he said, \"We're seeing an increase in the spread of the virus, so that's why it's incumbent upon all of us to recognize soberly that COVID-19 is not going away any time soon until there is a vaccine or an effective therapy\".[171]\nNewsom oversaw a sluggish initial rollout of vaccines; California had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country by January 2021,[176] and had only used about 30% of the vaccines it had at its disposal, a far lower rate than other states, by January 20.[177] Newsom had an approval rating of 64% in September 2020, but a February 2021 UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll found that his approval rate was down to 46%, with 48% disapproval, the highest of his tenure. The Los Angeles Times attributed this decline to public opinion of his management of the pandemic.[178] The vaccination rate began increasing in January, with over half the population fully vaccinated as of September 2021,[179] the percentage ranking #16 out of the 50 states.\nAlthough the Newsom administration enacted some of the country's most stringent pandemic restrictions in 2020, California had the 29th-highest death rate of all 50 states by May 2021.[180] Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at UCSF, said that California's restrictive approach \"did not lead to better health outcomes\", and criticized California's delay in implementing new CDC recommendations absolving the fully vaccinated from most indoor mask requirements, while saying the decision lacked scientific rationale and could cause \"collateral damage\".[181][182]\nPandemic unemployment fraud and debt\nIn January 2021, the Los Angeles Times reported that Newsom's administration had mismanaged $11.4 billion by disbursing unemployment benefits to ineligible claimants, especially those paid through the federally funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.[183] Another $19 billion in claims remained under investigation for fraud.[184] At the same time, legitimate claimants faced lengthy delays in receiving benefits.[185] The state's unemployment system had been overseen by California Labor Secretary Julie Su, a Newsom appointee, whom President Joe Biden later appointed as deputy secretary of labor in February 2021.[185]\nPolitical opponents attributed the crisis to the Newsom administration's failure to heed multiple warnings by federal officials of the potential for fraud, while Newsom's administration said the Trump administration's failure to provide appropriate guidance for the new federally funded program contributed to the fraud.[186] Experts said much of the fraud appeared to originate from international criminal gangs in 20 countries.[187][188][189] A report by California State Auditor Elaine Howle said $810 million was disbursed to claimants who had fraudulently filed on behalf of inmates in the state's prison system.[190]\nAccording to The Sacramento Bee, by the summer of 2021, California owed $23 billion to the federal government for unemployment benefits paid out during the pandemic, which was 43% of all unemployment debt, owed by 13 states at the time, to the federal government.[191] Most of this debt was unrelated to the federally funded pandemic unemployment programs that had experienced most of the fraud, and instead was due to longstanding underfunding and California's high rate of unemployment during the pandemic.[192]\nWildfires\nDue to a mass die-off of trees throughout California that could increase the risk of wildfires, Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 22, 2020, in preparation for the 2020 wildfire season.[193] After declaring a state of emergency on August 18, he reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16–17.[194] His request for assistance via issuance of a federal disaster declaration in the wake of six major wildfires was first rejected by the Trump administration, but accepted after Trump spoke to Newsom.[195]\nOn June 23, 2021, the NPR station CapRadio reported that Newsom and Cal Fire had falsely claimed in January 2020 that 90,000 acres (36,000 ha) of land at risk for wildfires had been treated with fuel breaks and prescribed burns; the actual treated area was 11,399 acres (4,613 ha), an overstatement of 690%.[196][197] According to CapRadio, the fuel breaks of the 35 \"priority projects\" Newsom had touted, which were meant to ensure the quick evacuation of residents while preventing traffic jams and a repeat of events in the 2018 fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, where at least eight evacuees burned to death in their vehicles, were struggling to mitigate fire spread in almost every instance while failing to prevent evacuation traffic jams.[197] The same day CapRadio revealed the oversight, leaked emails showed that Newsom's handpicked Cal Fire chief had ordered the removal of the original statement.[198] In another report in April 2022, CapRadio found a program, hailed in 2020 by the Newsom administration to fast-track environmental reviews on high-priority fire prevention projects, had failed to make progress.[199]\nKXTV released a series of reports chronicling PG&E's liabilities after committing 91 felonies in the Santa Rosa and Paradise fires. Newsom was accused of accepting campaign donations from PG&E in order to change the CPUC's ruling on PG&E's safety license. The rating change allowed PG&E to avoid billions of dollars in extra fees. Newsom was also accused of setting up the Wildfire Insurance Fund via AB 1054, using ratepayer fees, so PG&E could avoid financial losses[200][201] and pass the liability costs to ratepayers and taxpayers.[202][203]\nJune 2025 Los Angeles protests and Kilmar Abrego Garcia\nIn June 2025, protests broke out in Los Angeles after a series of federal immigration raids. As demonstrations continued, President Trump issued a memorandum federalizing up to 4,000 California National Guard troops and deploying U.S. Marines to assist with the response. Newsom objected, calling it an unconstitutional overreach of federal authority. On June 9, the State of California, led by Newsom, filed a federal lawsuit, Newsom v. Trump, challenging the legality of the troop deployment. The complaint argued that the order exceeded the president's statutory powers under 10 U.S.C. § 252 and violated the Tenth Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act. In April 2025, Newsom called the illegal deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador \"the distraction of the day\" set up by the Trump administration. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized Newsom's comment, saying, \"I think Americans are tired of elected officials or politicians who are all finger to the wind. Anyone who can't stand up for the Constitution and the right of due process doesn't deserve to lead.\"[204][205]\nEnergy and environment\nUpon taking office in 2019, Newsom succeeded Brown as co-chair of the United States Climate Alliance. In September 2019, Newsom vetoed SB 1, which would have preserved environmental protections at the state level that were set to roll back nationally under the Trump administration's environmental policy.[206] In February 2020, the Newsom administration sued federal agencies over the rollbacks to protect imperiled fish in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta in 2019.[207][208]\nNewsom attended the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, where he spoke of California as a climate leader due to the actions of governors before him.[209][206] In August 2020, he addressed the 2020 Democratic National Convention. His speech mentioned climate change and the wildfires prevalent in California at the time.[210] On September 23, 2020, Newsom signed an executive order to phase out sales of gasoline-powered vehicles and require all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.[211] Bills he signed in September with an environmental focus included a commission to study lithium extraction around the Salton Sea.[212]\nDuring his 2018 campaign, Newsom pledged to tighten state oversight of fracking and oil extraction.[213] Early in his governorship, his administration approved new oil and gas leases on public lands at about twice the rate of the prior year.[214][215][216] When asked about this development, Newsom said he was unaware of the rate of approvals, and he later fired the head of the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources.[213] In November 2019, he imposed a moratorium on approval of new hydraulic fracturing and steam-injected oil drilling in the state until the permits for those projects could be reviewed by an independent panel of scientists.[217] State agencies resumed issuing new hydraulic fracturing permits in April 2020.[218] In 2021, the Center for Biological Diversity sued the Newsom administration over the continued sale of oil and gas leases, and Consumer Watchdog called for the end of their sale.[219][220][221] In April 2021, Newsom committed to ending the sale of gas leases by 2024 and ending oil extraction by 2045.[222] In October 2021, he proposed a 3,200-foot (980 m) buffer between new fossil fuel extraction sites and densely populated areas.[223]\nIn 2022, gas prices in California exceeded $6 per gallon. Newsom attributed this to corporate greed and price gouging by oil companies. He proposed a windfall profits tax and penalty for oil companies in September 2022. On March 28, 2023, Newsom signed a law that authorizes the California Energy Commission to set \"a profit threshold above which companies would be assessed a financial penalty\", requires petroleum companies to report additional profit data to state regulators, and creates a new oversight division of the California Energy Commission to investigate price gouging in the gasoline industry.[224] In June 2025, Newsom signed California Assembly Bill 130 (2025) into law. In October 2025, Newsom vetoed Senate Bill 682 which sought to limit forever chemicals and Assembly Bill 93 which sought to require data centers to report their water use.[225][226][227][228]\nAnimal welfare\nIn 2019, Newsom signed a package of legislation aimed at curtailing animal cruelty and protecting animal welfare. In September 2019, he signed the Wildlife Protection Act, which prohibited commercial and recreational fur trapping.[229] In October 2019, he signed legislation prohibiting the manufacture and sale of new fur products in California, as well as legislation banning bobcat hunting, ending the use of most animals in circuses, and strengthening Proposition 6's prohibition on horse meat and horse slaughter.[230][231] In September 2022, Newsom signed legislation that banned animal testing of pesticides and other chemical substances on dogs and cats.[232] California's fur sales ban became effective in 2023, making California the first state to ban new fur sales.[233]\nIn September 2024, Newsom signed legislation supported by animal rights and environmental activists prohibiting the commercial farming of octopuses in California. The law states that octopuses are \"highly intelligent, curious, problem-solving animals\" that are capable of feeling pain.[234] California was the second state to ban octopus farming after Washington enacted a ban in March 2024.[234] In July 2025, the Department of Justice named the state of California, Newsom, and other California public officials in a lawsuit targeting the state's regulations against intensive battery cage eggs, including Proposition 2 and Proposition 12. Newsom's office responded that the Trump administration enjoys \"blaming California for literally everything\".[235]\nEthics concerns\nDonations to spouse's nonprofit organization\nThe Sacramento Bee reported that Jennifer Siebel Newsom's nonprofit organization The Representation Project had received more than $800,000 in donations from corporations that had lobbied the state government in recent years, including PG&E, AT&T, Comcast, and Kaiser Permanente. Siebel Newsom received $2.3 million in salary from the nonprofit since launching it in 2011. In 2021, Governor Newsom said that he saw no conflict in his wife's nonprofit accepting donations from companies that lobby his administration.[236]\nDonations to campaign\nIn February 2024, Bloomberg News reported that Newsom pushed for an exemption for businesses that bake and sell bread in AB 1228,[237] a bill that raises the state's minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 per hour. The exemption included 24 Panera Bread bakery-cafes owned by Greg Flynn, a businessman who donated $100,000 and $64,800 to Newsom's campaigns over the years. Republican lawmakers called for an investigation into the unusual exemption. When reporters asked him about the exemption, Newsom said: \"That's a part of the sausage making. We went back and forth, and that was part of the negotiation. That's the nature of negotiation ... That was all part of the give and take and that was the collective wisdom of the legislature and ultimately led to my signature.\"[238][239]\nIn September 2024, the Los Angeles Times reported that Newsom had signed AB 3206[240] into law, carving out an exception to the state's last call alcohol law for one specific venue, Intuit Dome, owned by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Ballmer's wife, Connie Ballmer, donated $1 million to the Newsom campaign in 2021. Ethics experts criticized the bill for exclusively benefiting a major donor to Newsom. \"It's certainly going to become an issue for his opponents and critics to point to the fact that he seemed to provide a special favor to a wealthy sports franchise owner and its facility and its wealthy fans. It just doesn't look good\", said John Pelissero, director of government ethics at Santa Clara University. A spokesperson for Newsom said, \"The governor's decisions on legislation are made solely on the merits of each bill.\"[241][242]\nExecutive authority and actions\nOverall, Newsom has vetoed legislation at a rate comparable to that of his predecessors. From 2019 to 2021, he vetoed 12.7% of the bills the legislature passed on average.[243] The rate declined over the course of the three legislative sessions.[243][244] Newsom's vetoes have included bills to allow ranked-choice voting, require an ethnic studies class as a high school graduation requirement, regulate AI, and reduce penalties for jaywalking.[245][246][247] Newsom used a larger than normal number of executive orders during the 2020 legislative session.[248][249]\nGun control\nAs lieutenant governor in 2016, Newsom was the official proponent of Proposition 63. The ballot measure required a background check and California Department of Justice authorization to purchase ammunition, among other gun control regulations. In response to the 2019 mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Newsom called for nationwide background checks on people purchasing ammunition.[250] Later that year, he responded to the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting by stating his support for the Second Amendment and saying he would like national cooperation controlling \"weapons of goddamned mass destruction\".[251] He also said, \"These shootings overwhelmingly, almost exclusively, are males, boys, 'men'—I put in loose quotes. I do think that is missing in the national conversation.\"[252]\nOn June 10, 2021, Newsom called federal Judge Roger Benitez \"a stone cold ideologue\" and \"a wholly owned subsidiary of the gun lobby of the National Rifle Association\" after Benitez struck down California's statewide ban on assault weapons.[253] While the ban remained in place as the state appealed the ruling, Newsom proposed legislation that would empower private citizens to enforce the ban after the United States Supreme Court declined to strike down the Texas Heartbeat Act, which empowers private citizens to report unauthorized abortions.[254]\nIn 2022, Newsom signed gun control bills passed by the California Legislature. On July 1, he signed Assembly Bill 1621, which restricts privately made firearms, which were found to be linked to over 100 violent crimes in Los Angeles, and Assembly Bill 2571, which prohibited the marketing of firearms such as the JR-15 to children.[255][256] On July 22, Newsom signed Senate Bill 1327, a law enabling private citizens to sue anyone who imports, distributes, manufactures or sells illegal firearms in California.[257] The law requires courts to award statutory damages of at least $10,000 and attorney's fees.[258]\nOn June 8, 2023, Newsom proposed a 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution to raise the age to buy firearms to 21, institute universal background checks for gun purchases, mandate waiting periods and ban assault weapons for civilians.[259][260] Law professor Erwin Chemerinsky called this a \"terrible idea\", since the advocated method (which has never been used) would be a constitutional convention (which is not understood to be limited to single amendments), potentially allowing a complete rewrite of the Constitution, or addition of other amendments on separate subjects, like abortion, or the often proposed balanced budget amendment (which liberals feel would decimate welfare programs).[261]\nAbortion\nIn December 2021, Newsom announced his intention to make California a \"sanctuary\" for abortion, which included possibly paying for procedures, travel, and lodging for out-of-state abortion seekers, if the procedure is banned in Republican-led states.[262] In March 2022, he signed a bill requiring private health insurance plans in the state to fully cover abortion procedures by eliminating associated co-pays and deductibles and increasing insurance premiums.[263] In February 2023, Newsom organized the Reproductive Freedom Alliance of state governors supportive of abortion and reproductive rights.[264]\nAfter Walgreens announced in March 2023 that it would refuse to dispense abortion pills in the 21 states where it is illegal, Newsom tweeted, \"California won't be doing business with @walgreens – or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women's lives at risk, we're done.\" He also said that Walgreens was giving in to \"right-wing bullies\" and that he would determine how California can cut ties with Walgreens.[265] He indicated that he wanted to cancel Walgreens' $54 million contract with the California state prison system.[266] Walgreens also receives $1.5 billion for filling prescriptions for the 15 million people enrolled in the state's Medi-Cal program (California's version of Medicaid).[266] Legal experts said that federal Medicaid laws do not allow health plans to disqualify providers for reasons other than fraud or contract violations, provisions that have prevented conservative states from blocking Medicaid spending to Planned Parenthood clinics.[266]\nHealth\nNewsom campaigned on reducing the cost of health care and increasing access. He also indicated his support for creating a universal state health-care system.[267] The budget passed in June 2019 expanded eligibility for Medi-Cal from solely undocumented minor children to undocumented young adults from ages 19 to 25.[267] In 2021, Newsom signed legislation expanding Medi-Cal eligibility to undocumented residents over age 50.[268][269] On June 30, 2022, he signed a $307.9 billion state budget that \"pledges to make all low-income adults eligible for the state's Medicaid program by 2024 regardless of their immigration status.\" This budget would make California the first U.S. state to guarantee healthcare to all low-income undocumented immigrants, at a cost of $2.7 billion per year.[270]\nNewsom was criticized in early 2022 for walking back from his support for universal health care and not supporting CalCare, Assembly Bill 1400, which would have instituted single-payer healthcare in California; critics suggested that opposition from business interests, which had donated large sums to Newsom and his party, had swayed his opinion.[271][272]\nOn July 6, 2022, Newsom signed Senate Bill 184, which established the Office of Health Care Affordability, with the stated goal to \"develop data-informed policies and enforceable cost targets, with the ultimate goal of containing health care costs\".[273] In August 2022, Newsom vetoed Senate Bill 57 which sought to authorize jurisdictions to approve supervised injection sites.[274][275] Newsom signed The Zacky Bill.[276] In October 2023, Newsom vetoed a bill to cap co-pays for insulin at $35.[277][278] In 2025, Newsom signed a budget that restricted new enrollment of undocumented immigrants in Medi-Cal.[279][280] Newsom signed the California Senate Bill 41 (2025) but vetoed other measures to regulate pharmacy benefit managers.[281][282][283][284]\nPrivacy\nIn October 2023, Newsom signed the California Delete Act, providing a one-stop shop deletion mechanism for consumers to direct data brokers to delete their personal information.[285]\nInfrastructure and development\nHigh-speed rail\nIn his February 2019 State of the State address, Newsom announced that, while work would continue on the 171-mile (275 km)[286] Central Valley segment from Bakersfield to Merced, the rest of the system would be indefinitely postponed, citing cost overruns and delays.[287] This and other actions created tension with the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, a labor union representing 450,000 members.[288]\nHomelessness and housing shortage\nA poll found that California voters thought the most important issue for Newsom and the state legislature to work on in 2020 was homelessness.[289] In his first week of office, Newsom threatened to withhold state funding for infrastructure to communities that failed to take actions to alleviate California's housing shortage.[290][291] In late January 2019, he announced that he would sue Huntington Beach for preventing the construction of affordable housing.[292] A year later, the city acted to settle the lawsuit by the state.[293] Newsom opposes NIMBY (not-in-my-back-yard) sentiment, declaring in 2022 that \"NIMBYism is destroying the state\".[294][295][296][297] In 2021, he signed a pair of bills into law that made zoning regulations for housing less restrictive, allowing construction of duplexes and fourplexes in lots that were previously zoned exclusively for single-family homes.[298] Newsom also signed a bill which expedites the environmental review process for new multifamily developments worth at least $15,000,000. To participate, developers must apply directly through the governor's office.[299]\nIn 2022, Newsom signed 39 bills into law intended to address California's housing crisis, three of which entailed major land use reform.[300] One bill eliminated minimum parking requirements for housing near mass transit stations throughout the state.[301] Michael Manville, an urban planning professor at UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs, called it \"one of the biggest land-use reforms in the country\". Another bill allowed developers to build housing on some lots previously zoned exclusively for commercial use without getting local governments' permission if a certain percentage of the housing was affordable.[302] A third bill allowed for the construction of market-rate housing on some lots previously zoned exclusively for commercial use.[302] At the signing ceremony for the latter two bills, Newsom warned local governments, which have a history of blocking and delaying housing developments, that they would be held accountable for future housing obstructionism.[300] Other bills he signed required localities \"to approve or deny various building permits within a strict timeline\" and streamlined student and faculty housing projects by allowing California colleges to skip onerous review processes for new projects.[300] Measures and actions to reduce homelessness in California have not yet solved the problem.[303] The number of homeless reached a record 181,000 in January 2023.[304] According to some, to cope with this problem, California must build more than 2.5 million housing units.[303]\nIn October 2023, Newsom vetoed several bills aimed at expanding access to housing assistance including the California Social Housing Act. One was a bill to repurpose unused state-owned land for affordable housing, which he said infringed on state sovereignty. Another would have expanded the number of people who qualify for state housing assistance. A third would have mandated that Medi-Cal cover the cost of housing assistance.[305][306][307] Newsom has signed the Abundant and Affordable Homes Near Transit Act, Affordable Housing on Faith and Higher Education Lands Act, California Assembly Bill 2097 (2022) and California HOME Act. In August 2024, Newsom warned counties that did not remove their homeless encampments that failure to do so would result in their state funding being cut off the next year.[308] He issued this warning after personally visiting and clearing out a Los Angeles homeless encampment without notifying the city beforehand.[309] In September 2025, Newsom vetoed Assembly Bill 1840 which sought to prohibit the disqualification of applicants to California Housing Finance Agency home purchase assistance programs based solely on their immigration status.[310][311]\nWater management\nNewsom supports a series of tentative water-sharing agreements that would bring an end to the dispute between farmers, cities, fishers, and environmentalists over how much water should be left in the state's two most important rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin, which flow into the Delta.[312]\nNative American relations\nIn a speech before representatives of Native Americans in June 2019, Newsom apologized for the genocide of Native Americans approved and abetted by the California state government upon statehood in the 19th century. By one estimate, at least 4,500 Native Californians were killed between 1849 and 1870.[313] Newsom said, \"That's what it was, a genocide. No other way to describe it. And that's the way it needs to be described in the history books.\"[314] In October 2024, Newsom signed AB 3074, the \"California Racial Mascots Act\", which prohibits K-12 schools not run by recognized Native American tribes from using \"derogatory\" names or mascots.[315]\nLGBTQ+ rights\nIn September 2022, Newsom signed Senate Bill 107 into law,[316] making California the first sanctuary state for transgender youth. He issued an official state proclamation for Pride Month in June 2023,[317] issued a fine of $1.5 million to a school district whose board rejected a curriculum including a biography of gay rights leader Harvey Milk,[318] and signed a bill prohibiting schools from banning textbooks based on their inclusion of references to people from minority groups or the LGBT community.[319] In July 2024, he signed the \"SAFETY Act\", which prohibits schools from outing students' gender identity to their parents without the students' consent.[320] Newsom vetoed several bills, passed by the Assembly by a wide margin, one of which would have instructed judges who preside over custody battles to take a parent's affirmation of a child's gender identity into account, and another of which would have mandated that insurance plans serving California residents cover the cost of gender-affirming care.[321][322]\nReparations\nNewsom vetoed legislation seeking to that give the descendants of enslaved people preference in college admissions, home loan assistance and restitution for property seized in past years by the government through eminent domain.[323][324]\nCaste discrimination\nIn October 2023, Newsom vetoed a bill to ban discrimination based on caste, calling it \"unnecessary\" and adding that California \"already prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other characteristics, and state law specifies that these civil rights protections shall be liberally construed.\" Many Hindu rights organizations applauded the veto, saying the bill \"would have put a target on hundreds of thousands of Californians simply because of their ethnicity or their religious identity\". Advocates for the rights of Dalits and other marginalized castes sharply criticized the veto.[325][326][327]\nLabor rights\nNewsom signed California Assembly Bill 5 (2019).[328] Newsom also signed the California FAST Recovery Act (2022).[329] In October 2023, Newsom vetoed a bill to provide unemployment insurance to striking workers, citing excess burden on the state's unemployment system.[330][331] He also vetoed a bill to expand the mandatory warning given to employees soon to be laid off from 60 days to 75, extend the same protections to long-term contract workers, and prohibit employers from making laid-off employees sign nondisclosure agreements in order to receive severance.[332] In 2024, Newsom vetoed SB 1299, which \"would have required workers' comp judges to presume farmworkers who claim heat illness developed it at work\".[333][334][335] Newsom vetoed legislation seeking to extend unemployment benefits to undocumented workers.[336]\nInternational trips\nNewsom's first international trip as governor was to El Salvador.[337] With nearly 680,000 Salvadoran immigrants living in California, he said that the \"state's relationship with Central America is key to California's future\".[338] He was also concerned about the tens of thousands of Salvadorans who were fleeing the smallest country in Central America for the U.S. each year.[339] As governor of a state impacted by the debate of illegal immigration, he went to see the factors driving it firsthand, and to build business and tourism partnerships between California and Central America. He said he wanted to \"ignite a more enlightened engagement and dialogue\".[340]\nIn October 2023, Newsom took a week-long trip to China.[341] It began in Hong Kong, where he attended a discussion at the University of Hong Kong about climate change. He then traveled to Beijing, where he met with Chinese president Xi Jinping, discussing issues including climate change, trade relations, and the response to fentanyl production.[342] Chinese officials reportedly physically blocked American media members from attending the meeting while allowing access to Chinese reporters.[343] The visit also included stops in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shanghai.[342] Newsom called for better relations between the U.S. and China during the trip, saying \"divorce is not an option\" for the two countries.[344] The trip drew criticism from a coalition of 50 U.S.-based pro-democracy and human rights organizations, which issued a joint statement attacking it for sidelining human rights concerns.[345] Before the trip, a spokesperson for Newsom said the visit would focus on climate change, not human rights, as the latter was a federal issue.[346]\nIsrael\nIn August 2019, Newsom unconditionally apologized to California's Jewish community for a controversial ethnic studies draft curriculum that omitted the experience of Jews in America and sometimes criticized Israel. He was described as a longtime supporter of Israel and touted the memorandum of understanding that California and Israel inked together in 2014. Newsom said that Israel, with its success in technologies like drip irrigation and wastewater recycling, had a lot to offer California.[347] On October 20, 2023, Newsom visited Israel to express solidarity with it during the Gaza war.[348] He met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli president Isaac Herzog, other top Israeli officials, and survivors of the October 7 attacks.[349]\nElections\nIn October 2023, Newsom vetoed Assembly Bill 1248, which sought to require independent redistricting.[350][351] In September 2024, Newsom vetoed Assembly Bill 2724, which sought to require schools to ensure students receive information on how to pre-register to vote.[352][353]\n2025 California Proposition 50\nIn August 2025, Newsom secured legislative approval of California Proposition 50, a state constitutional amendment to allow congressional redistricting. The goal was to switch seats from Republican to Democratic control, in response to the 2025 Texas gerrymander that would add five new Republican seats.[354][355][356] The measure was approved by voters in November.[357][358]\nNational profile and political future\nMany journalists and political analysts have mentioned Newsom as a presidential hopeful. According to a June 2023 poll by NewsNation, 22% of California voters wanted Newsom to enter the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[359] In May 2023, Schwarzenegger said it was a \"no-brainer\" that Newsom would someday run for president.[360] An April 2023 article published in The Hill by journalist Sharon Udasin also discussed the inevitability of a Newsom presidential run.[361] In September 2022, Newsom said that he would not run for president in 2024, citing his \"vulnerable\" 2021 recall.[362] After his 2022 reelection, he informed White House staff that he would not challenge Biden in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries;[363] he endorsed Biden's reelection campaign on April 25, 2023.[364]\nNewsom has become an outspoken critic of the policies of Florida governor Ron DeSantis, denouncing DeSantis's orchestration of the Martha's Vineyard migrant airlift.[365] DeSantis responded by saying California has \"huge problems\" and dared Newsom to run against Biden.[366] In November 2023, the two debated, with Fox News's Sean Hannity as moderator.[367] In July 2024, Newsom launched a podcast, Politickin', co-hosted by Marshawn Lynch and Doug Hendrickson.[368] After Biden's sudden withdrawal from the presidential race that month, Newsom said he would not seek the Democratic nomination, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.[369]\nAfter Donald Trump won the 2024 election, Newsom called for California lawmakers to convene later in 2024 to safeguard California's policies from the upcoming second Trump administration.[370] In December 2024, Newsom criticized Biden for pardoning his son Hunter Biden.[371][372] He said, \"I'm disappointed and can't support the decision.\"[373] In anticipation of a potential 2028 U.S. presidential election campaign, Newsom has adjusted his political approach to appeal to a broader electorate. A key shift in his strategy has been his engagement with conservative voices, including hosting MAGA figures like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on his podcast, This is Gavin Newsom.[374][375] While this tactic has received a fair amount of criticism from his own supporters, Newsom has also been praised by figures on the left for his hawkish response to the Trump administration's actions regarding gerrymandering, with his widely publicized Election Rigging Response Act in August 2025 seen by many commentators as a soft launch of a presidential run.[376] In August 2025, Newsom started communicating on social media platforms in a style intended to mimic President Trump's communications.[377]\nOther political activism\nIn 2023, Newsom launched Campaign for Democracy, a PAC to take on \"authoritarian leaders\" in the U.S. It is thought to be a starting point for a possible 2028 presidential bid.[378] As of July 2024, Campaign for Democracy has raised $24 million for direct contributions to candidates and other spending.[379] The group is not subject to contribution limits, but it can coordinate with Newsom as long as he is not a candidate for federal office.[380]\nPersonal life\nNewsom was baptized and raised in his father's Catholic faith. In 2008, he described himself as an \"Irish Catholic rebel ... in some respects, but one that still has tremendous admiration for the Church and very strong faith\"; when asked about the state of the Catholic Church, Newsom said it was in crisis.[13] He said he stays with the Church because of his \"strong connection to a greater purpose, and to sort of a higher being\".[13] Newsom identifies as a practicing Catholic,[381] saying in 2008 that he has a \"strong sense of faith that is perennial, day in and day out\".[13] He has personal ties to the Jewish community. As a child, Newsom attended Hanukkah celebrations with Jewish extended family, went to a JCC preschool in San Francisco, and spent time at the Jewish summer camp Camp Tawonga. He credits the Jewish values he absorbed—especially tikkun olam—for shaping his identity and worldview and helping him succeed in business and politics. Newsom told his son that they are partly Jewish and have Jewish cousins in the Newsom family when one of his friends expressed antisemitic views. In 2019, he took steps to combat antisemitism by allocating $15 million for synagogue security, $6 million for the Holocaust Museum LA, and $23.5 million for Jewish summer camps affected by wildfires.[347]\nIn December 2001, Newsom married legal commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle at Saint Ignatius Catholic Church.[11][382] They separated in 2004 and jointly filed for divorce in January 2005, citing \"difficulties due to their careers on opposite coasts\".[383] Their divorce was finalized on February 28, 2006, by which time Guilfoyle was expecting a child with Eric Villency.[384] Guilfoyle gained prominence in 2011 via a Fox News chat show.[385] She was later named senior advisor to Republican president Donald Trump, whom Newsom has extensively criticized, and was later engaged to Donald Trump Jr.[386]\nIn September 2006, Newsom, then 38, briefly dated 19-year-old Brittanie Mountz, a model and restaurant hostess.[387][388] On January 31, 2007, Newsom's close friend, campaign manager, and former chief of staff Alex Tourk confronted him after learning from his wife, Ruby Rippey-Tourk, that she and Newsom had an affair in 2005, when she was Newsom's appointments secretary. Tourk immediately resigned.[389] Newsom admitted to the affair the next day and apologized to the public, saying he was \"deeply sorry\" for his \"personal lapse of judgment\".[390] In 2018, Rippey-Tourk said that she thought it wrong to associate Newsom's behavior with the #MeToo movement: \"I was a subordinate, but I was also a free-thinking, 33-yr old adult married woman and mother. I do want to make sure that the #metoo movement is reserved for cases and situations that deserve it.\"[391]\nNewsom began dating film director Jennifer Siebel in October 2006. He announced he would seek treatment for alcohol use disorder in February 2007.[392] The couple announced their engagement in December 2007,[393][394] and they were married in Stevensville, Montana, in July 2008.[395] They have four children: a daughter born in 2009, a son born in 2011, a daughter born in 2013, and a son born in 2016.[396][397][398][399] After he completed service as mayor of San Francisco in 2011, Newsom and his family moved to a house they bought in Kentfield in Marin County in 2012.[400] After his election as governor, Newsom and his family moved into the California Governor's Mansion in Downtown Sacramento and thereafter settled in Fair Oaks.[401] In May 2019, The Sacramento Bee reported that Newsom's $3.7 million purchase of a 12,000-square-foot home in Fair Oaks was the most expensive private residence sold in the Sacramento region since the year began.[401]\nIn August 2021, Newsom sold the Marin County home for $5.9 million in an off-market transaction. He had originally put the property up for sale in early 2019 for $5.895 million, but removed the property from the market after a price reduction to $5.695 million.[402] Newsom is the godfather of designer, model, and LGBTQ rights activist Nats Getty.[403][404] According to James Reginato's Growing Up Getty, the Newsoms, Harrises, Pelosis, and Gettys are godparents to one another's children and make appearances at important family events.[405]\nWorks\n- Gavin Newsom (2013; co-authored with Lisa Dickey).

Central to their claims is the operation of his eponymous charity, the Trump Foundation. Recently, however, the Trump Foundation has come under media and partisan scrutiny. Detractors claim that it's not the unblemished source of selfless largesse that it has been made out to be.\nWhat is the Trump Foundation?\nThe Donald J Trump Foundation is a private charitable organisation started by Donald Trump in 1987 with money he earned from his best-selling book, The Art of the Deal.\nUp until about 2005, the foundation was primarily funded by Mr Trump himself, including a million-dollar contribution in 1989. Since then, however, it has been bankrolled almost exclusively by donations from Mr Trump's friends and associates.\nAccording to its 2014 filing with the Internal Revenue Service (the most recent on record) the foundation claimed assets totalling $1,273,895 and brought in $500,849 - almost entirely from a gift from New York ticket-reselling mogul Richard Ebers, a regular contributor. The foundation gave out $591,450.\nOther past prominent Foundation donors include Vince McMahon, the professional wrestling impresario and NBC Universal (which aired Mr Trump's show, The Apprentice).\nMany of the contributions to Mr Trump's foundation appear to be in lieu of payments to Mr Trump himself. People Magazine gave $150,000 after it received rights to publish photos of Mr Trump's son, Barron. Comedy Central donated $400,000 after Mr Trump appeared on one of its celebrity roasts.\nSeveral dozen charitable groups received contributions in 2014 - about an average number for the foundation. They included the Alliance for Lupus Research, the American Skin Association, the Anti-Defamation League and a variety of veterans' charities.\nIn 2009 the foundation gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\nThe Clinton Foundation? So is the Trump Foundation kind of the same deal?\nNo! Well, they both have the word \"foundation\" in their names, but other than that there really aren't many similarities.\nFirst of all, the billion-dollar Clinton Foundation is much, much bigger. It employs a staff of 486 and thousands of programme workers, while the Trump Foundation's board is Mr Trump, his oldest children and a treasurer. It has no paid employees.\nThe Clinton organisation is what's called an \"operating foundation\" or \"public charity\" - which funds and manages its own on-the-ground programmes. The Trump Foundation, on the other hand, external, serves as a pass-through for donations to other groups, which then perform charitable functions. Per IRS regulations, it's categorised as a \"private non-operating foundation\".\nThe nonprofit monitoring organisation Guidestar has given, external the Clinton Foundation a \"platinum seal\" of transparency for providing additional information on its operations. The Trump Foundation has declined to furnish requested details.\n\"The Trump Foundation's approach would certainly not meet the standard of focused, proactive grantmaking commonly called 'strategic philanthropy,'\" writes Guidestar president Jacob Harold.\nThe two foundations do have a bit in common, however. They're both associated with individuals seeking the presidency in 2016, and they've both been the target of allegations of impropriety.\nSo why has the Trump Foundation become controversial?\nCompared to the Clinton Foundation, the Trump Foundation hasn't received nearly as much media attention, but the stories that have come out have painted a sometimes-less-than-flattering picture. Here are some of the reasons why:\nCo-opted credit: Mr Trump has repeatedly claimed that he's making a donation to a charity only to fund that donation with money from his foundation. Given that at this point the foundation's funding comes from outside sources, he is in effect taking credit - and being lauded - for simply passing charitable donations along.\nThe Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, who has conducted extensive investigation into Mr Trump's charitable involvement, cites, external the \"Palm Tree Award\" Mr Trump received for a $150,000 donation he made (from his foundation's money) to the Palm Beach Police Foundation. That donation came only after the Trump Foundation had received a $150,000 contribution from the New Jersey based Charles Evans Foundation, however. When the Evans Foundation donations stopped, the money to the police charity from Mr Trump's foundation ended as well.\n\"Trump had effectively turned the Evans Foundation's gifts into his own gifts, without adding any money of his own,\" Fahrenthold notes.\nMr Trump also benefited from the fact that the Police Foundation holds its annual charity dinner at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. In 2014, for instance, the charity paid the club, external $276,463 in rental fees. Mr Trump often gave foundation donations to groups that were paying top dollar to hold events on his properties.\nPersonal purchases: Although much of the money in the Trump Foundation has been gifted to other charitable organisations, some of it has been spent on purchases from charity auctions, including $20,000 for a 6ft tall painting of Mr Trump in 2007 and $12,000 for a football helmet signed by NFL quarterback Tim Tebow in 2012.\nThe whereabouts of those two items are currently unknown. If they stayed in Mr Trump's possession, it would appear to be a violation of US tax law prohibiting \"self-dealing\" - where managers of charitable groups purchase gifts for themselves from foundation funds. If the IRS determines this was the case, Mr Trump would have to reimburse his foundation for the market value of the purchase and pay a penalty.\nQuestionable donations: As Mr Trump began attempting to curry favour with Republicans in recent years, more of his donations have been directed to conservative causes. In 2014 he made a $10,000 donation to the American Spectator Foundation, the nonprofit group that publishes the arch-conservative magazine of the same name.\nThe Trump Foundation also made a $100,000 donation - its largest gift of that year - to Citizens United, a conservative group best known for a lawsuit that ended with the US Supreme Court striking down limits on many of the kinds of political campaign donations Mr Trump has criticised during his candidacy.\nThese kinds of donations, while representing a shift in the foundation's charitable giving patterns, are perfectly legal. In 2013, however, the Trump Foundation made a $25,000 contribution to \"And Justice for All\", a campaign committee supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Political donations of this kind from a charitable foundation are prohibited. When the contribution was discovered in 2016, Mr Trump moved $25,000 from his personal account to compensate his foundation and paid a $2,500 IRS fine. Trump Foundation representatives have said the contribution was made in error.\nAs multiple news outlets have pointed out, the original donation arrived just days after Florida announced it was not joining a multi-state lawsuit against Trump University - a Trump-branded for-profit company that offered real-estate seminars and has been accused of fraud. A New York Times open-records request, external found no evidence that Ms Bondi was directly involved in that decision, however.\nOK, Trump paid a fine. Does the foundation have any other legal troubles?\nYes. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman - the Democrat who is spearheading the investigation into Trump University - announced on 3 October that he has ordered the Trump Foundation to stop fundraising.\nThe foundation had neglected to register under article 7A of New York's Executive Law, which is required for any charity soliciting more than $25,000 (£19,440) a year, a letter from Schneiderman's office said\nTrump officials have denounced the investigation as partisan.\nDemocrats in Congress have requested that the US Department of Justice initiate a criminal investigation into the Bondi donation for possible violation of federal bribery laws. The left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has made a similar request of a US attorney in Florida - although proving such quid-pro-quo cases is extremely difficult.\nIn addition the group has filed a formal request that the IRS revoke the Trump Foundation's nonprofit tax status - an action the IRS will likely only take if it finds egregious and repeated violations of its regulations.\nBut Trump says he gives lots of money to charities. Is he lying?\nWho knows?\nBecause Mr Trump hasn't released his tax returns, there's no way to tell exactly how much he gives to charities. The Post's Fahrenthold has been doggedly trying to track down, external any and all of Mr Trump's personal donations but has only identified one gift, of less than $10,000, between 2008 and May 2016.\nIn May, four months after pledging to do so and after heightened media attention, Mr Trump donated $1m to a veterans' charity. The Republican candidate has also recently donated $100,000 to a charity aiding relief efforts following devastating floods in Louisiana.\nMike Pence, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, said, external on 12 September that his running mate \"has given away tens of millions of dollars to charitable causes throughout his business life\".\nThe Trump campaign released a list of charitable donations it says the candidate has made totalling $102m over the past five years - but the items listed were either in-kind contributions such as free rounds of golf at Mr Trump's courses offered at charity auctions and land-conservation agreements or money originating from the Trump Foundation.\n\"The Foundation's second-biggest donation described on the campaign's list went to the charity of a man who had settled a lawsuit with one of Trump's golf courses after being denied a hole-in-one prize,\" Fahrenthold and the Post's Rosalind Helderman write.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Donald J.

Trump Foundation was a New York–based tax-exempt private foundation formed in 1988 by Donald Trump and dissolved by court order in 2018 after various legal violations came to light.\nThe foundation was created to receive royalties from Trump's 1987 book Trump: The Art of the Deal as well as donations from others, for the stated purpose of distributing the funds to charitable causes. Trump's children Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr. served on the board, which did not meet after 1999.[2] Trump stopped contributing to the foundation in 2008, but continued to solicit donations.[3]\nThe foundation's activities came under scrutiny during the 2016 presidential election campaign, initially by The Washington Post's David Fahrenthold. Law enforcement investigators subsequently discovered various ethical and legal violations, including failure to register in New York, self-dealing and illegal campaign contributions.[4][5][6] In December 2016, Trump tried to dissolve the foundation, but the New York State Attorney General's office blocked dissolution pending completion of its investigations.[7] Trump served as its president until January 2017, three days after his inauguration as U.S. president.[8][9][10]\nOn June 14, 2018, New York attorney general Barbara Underwood filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump himself, and Trump's adult children—Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr.—alleging \"a shocking pattern of illegality\" with respect to the foundation's money.[11][12][13] On December 18, 2018, Underwood announced that the foundation had agreed to shut down under court supervision and distribute its remaining assets to court-approved charities, although she did not end investigations of the foundation and its directors.[14] In November 2019, Trump admitted to using the foundation for his business and political purposes and was ordered to pay $2 million as restitution.[15][16] Additionally, Trump was required to reimburse $11,525 to the foundation, which was added to $1,797,598.30 already in the foundation's bank account. The money as well as the funds in the foundation's bank were paid to eight charities in December 2019.[17]\nThe winding down of the foundation and the settlement did not end investigations of the foundation and its directors nor resolve any other potential prosecutions of Trump and others arising from the dealings by or through the foundation. On February 22, 2021, the Supreme Court in Trump v. Vance rejected any further delay in the production of Trump's tax records by Trump's accountants Mazars, under an August 2019 subpoena.[18] Mazars handed over to Vance millions of pages of documents containing Trump's tax returns from January 2011 to August 2019, as well as financial statements, engagement agreements, documents relating to the preparation and review of tax returns, and work papers and communications related to the tax returns.[19]\nOverview\n[edit]Stated purpose and structure\n[edit]Donald Trump formed the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 1988 as a private foundation.[20][21][22] Its initial stated purpose was to distribute proceeds from Trump's book,Trump: The Art of the Deal, to charitable causes.[8][9] Like many other private foundations, the Trump Foundation conducted no charitable programs of its own, instead granting money to other tax-exempt organizations.[23][24]\nThe foundation was based at the Trump Organization in New York City and had no paid staff or dedicated office space.[23] Donald Trump was its president until January 2017, three days after his inauguration as U.S. president. Trump's three adult children – Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. – were all listed as on the board of directors, as was Trump Organization's treasurer/CFO Allen Weisselberg. In 2017, Weisselberg claimed in a deposition to New York State investigators that he wasn't aware he was a board member \"at least for the last 10 or 15 years\".[25][26][27] According to the New York attorney general, the board had not met after 1999.[28][2] In 2015, a Trump Organization spokesperson told the New York Post that Trump made all decisions regarding the granting of the foundation's money.[10] According to the foundation's IRS Form 990 filing for 2013, in making grants the directors were not subject to any \"restrictions or limitations on awards such as by geographical areas, charitable fields, kinds of institutions, or other factors\".[29][30]\nSources of funds\n[edit]Until 2015, Trump contributed $5.5 million to the Trump Foundation, including money from his book, while outside donors contributed an additional $9.3 million.[31][32] From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4 million which had been spent by the end of 2006. After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity.[33] His final payment to the foundation was $35,000 in 2008.[10]\nMany of the outside donors to the foundation have done business with Trump or the Trump Organization.[34] Several philanthropy experts said having a family foundation primarily funded by outside money is unusual.[31][34]\nThe top donors to the foundation from 2004 to 2014 were Vince and Linda McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), or WWE itself. $5 million was donated to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007 and 2009.[34][35] The donations were reported by the Trump Foundation as coming from the WWE, but the WWE has claimed money came from Vince and Linda McMahon personally. Later, when Linda McMahon was running for U.S. Senate in Connecticut, the McMahons claimed the funds came from Vince only.[36] Some have alleged that the money was paid as compensation to Trump and therefore should have been subject to payroll taxes.[36]\nTrump solicited donations in lieu of payment for other services as well. In 2005 Norwegian Cruise Line donated $100,000 in lieu of an appearance fee for Melania Trump.[37][38] In 2006, People magazine donated $150,000 for an exclusive right to publish baby photos of Barron Trump. In 2011 Comedy Central donated $400,000 for Trump's appearance in a broadcast comedy roast of himself.[38]\nDissolution\n[edit]In September 2016 the New York attorney general's office, which administers the state's Charities Bureau, announced it was investigating the Trump Foundation based on its failure to file required forms with the bureau. One week later the office issued a \"Notice of Violation\".[39][40]\nIn December 2016, one month before his inauguration, then president-elect Trump announced that he would dissolve the Trump Foundation to avoid \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President\".[41][42] However, the office of the New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman blocked the dissolution, saying the foundation \"cannot legally dissolve\" until its current investigation is completed.[7]\nIn June 2018 the same office filed a civil suit against the Trump Foundation and its board members, ordering (among other requirements) that it be shut down and that restitution be made by its board members. The office also referred information on possible legal violations to the FEC and the IRS.[43] The following month, the New York State governor's chief counsel announced that Governor Andrew Cuomo was ready to provide the state's attorney general's office with the requisite criminal referral in the matter for possible criminal prosecution under state law.[44] In December of that year, the foundation signed a stipulation agreement to dissolve, with its assets going only to charities approved by the attorney general's office.[45][46][47] Soon after, Attorney General Underwood announced that the foundation had agreed to shut down under court supervision and distribute its remaining assets to court-approved charities, although she did not end investigations of the foundation and its directors.[14]\nInvestigations by The Washington Post and others\n[edit]During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, David Fahrenthold of The Washington Post began looking into Trump's history of charitable giving. In January 2016, Trump held a fundraiser for veterans' causes in lieu of appearing at a televised Republican debate. He claimed that the event raised $6 million, including $1 million of his own money.[48][49][50] Fahrenthold began his investigation by attempting to verify the receipt and disbursal of the $6 million. All donations were supposed to have gone into the Trump Foundation and then granted by the foundation to others. Fahrenthold determined instead that, several months after the rally, the Trump Foundation had yet to disburse funds to any veteran-related charities.[48] Although some of the funds went directly to causes without passing through the Trump Foundation, Fahrenthold widened his investigation into a larger investigation into Trump's history of charitable giving.[51] In the November 2019 settlement ordering Trump to pay $2 million in damages, he acknowledged that the veterans' fundraiser had been a campaign event and that his campaign had been given full control of the raised funds.[52]\nIn June 2016, in response to criticism, Trump asserted publicly that he had given about $102 million to charitable causes from 2009 through 2015[53] and released a 93-page list of more than 4,800 donations. Just under $90 million of the total was in the form of conservation easements on Trump properties or land donations to the State of New York; the list also contained more than 2,900 donations of free rounds of golf.[54] Further investigations led to an increasing list of allegations of abuse inside the foundation since its creation.[55][56][57][58]\nFahrenthold's investigation into the Trump Foundation and Trump's history of personal charitable giving involved hundreds of calls to charities associated with Donald Trump; it was also notable in that he drew heavily on support and investigative help from a large number of his Twitter followers who helped him track down leads on specific charities.[59]\nFahrenthold received the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his investigations into the Trump Foundation.[51]\nLegal and ethical controversies\n[edit]| External audio | |\n|---|---|\n| *Journalist Says Trump Foundation May Have Engaged In 'Self-Dealing'\", 37:18, September 28, 2016, Fresh Air with Terry Gross[60] Interview with David Fahrenthold |\nAccusations against Trump and his foundation include the following:\nFailure to maintain proper governance\n[edit]In a June 2018 petition filed by the office of the New York attorney general, it was explained that:\n... none of the Foundation's expenditures or activities were approved by its Board of Directors. The investigation found that the Board existed in name only: it did not meet after 1999; it did not set policy or criteria for choosing grant recipients, and it did not approve of any grants. Mr. Trump alone made all decisions related to the Foundation.[61]\nIn an exhibit attached to the filing, Trump Foundation treasurer Allen Weisselberg claimed he had not been aware that he was the treasurer or on the board of the foundation until he was approached by investigators.[25]\nSolicitation of donations without a license\n[edit]Under New York State law, a not-for-profit foundation must register as a \"7A Charitable Organization\" if it plans to solicit outside donations over $25,000 in any year.[62] The Trump Foundation was initially registered as a private foundation set up solely to receive his own personal donations. As long as it was private and did not solicit outside funds, it did not have to file annual audited reports with the New York State Charities Bureau.[62] However, records show that Trump began soliciting donations at least as early as 2004[62] and possibly as early as 1989.[63]\nMishandling of funds raised for veterans' causes\n[edit]In April 2016, Fox News reported that more than two months after Trump said he had raised $6 million for military veterans at a pre-Iowa caucus fundraiser, \"most of the organizations targeted to receive the money have gotten less than half of that amount\".[64] Around that time, Trump also said he had contributed $1,000,000 of his personal funds.[48] In late May, Trump revised his figures downward, saying $5.6 million had been raised at the event and that he had contributed his one million only the previous week, after the media criticized him.[48] He also provided a list of the beneficiaries of the $5.6 million,[65] although the full amount is disputed in a lawsuit filed by New York State in 2018, which cites an amount of $2.8 million.[66]\nCoordinating foundation grants with Trump's presidential campaign\n[edit]Trump may have used Trump Foundation grants to advance his presidential campaign, in violation of rules barring charities from engaging in political activity.[67] Trump distributed at least some of the funds publicly at \"Donald Trump for President\" rallies, displaying large-size donation checks that included his campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again\" or a link to a campaign website.[32][67][68]\nTrump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg testified in an October 2017 deposition that he had witnessed Donald Trump's campaign staff coordinate with Trump to use the Iowa fundraiser to benefit the campaign.[25] In 2018, New York State attorney general Barbara Underwood alleged in a larger suit against the foundation that Trump, in using the foundation to promote his campaign during and after the Iowa fundraiser, had violated charities laws.[69][70]\nGrants to the National Museum of Catholic Art and Library\n[edit]In each of 1995 and 1999, the Trump Foundation granted $50,000 to the National Museum of Catholic Art and Library. A 2001 report by The Village Voice stated, after visiting the museum in East Harlem, that the facility had \"next to no art\" and no official connection to the Catholic Church, despite a ten-year record of having solicited large-scale donations for its collection. The Voice and, later, The Washington Post, concluded that Trump may have directed the grants to the museum to curry favor with the museum's then-chairman, Eddie Malloy, who was also head of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. The council had worked on behalf of one of the unions of workers who worked on Trump construction projects.[32][71]\nFailure to make pledged 9/11 grants\n[edit]An investigation by the New York City Comptroller's office in October 2016 showed that Trump and/or the Donald Trump Foundation may have failed to honor at least one pledge to charities established to provide relief for victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Trump had made a pledge of $10,000 to the Twin Towers Fund on The Howard Stern Show in late September 2001.[72] The Twin Towers Fund, later administered as part of the New York City Public and Private Initiative, was created by New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani \"to benefit the families of firefighters and police officers who died in the attacks\".[73]\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Giuliani announced that Trump had made unspecified \"anonymous\" donations after the September 11 attacks, although such donations have not been identified.[72] Giuliani also said, in support of Trump's candidacy, \"Every time New York City suffered a tragedy Donald Trump was there to help ... He's not going to like my telling you this but he did it anonymously.\"[72]\nThe New York City Comptroller's office told the New York Daily News it had manually reviewed \"approximately 1,500 pages of donor records of the Twin Towers Fund and the related entity NYC Public/Private Initiatives Inc., containing the names of more than 110,000 individuals and entities that were collected as part of the audits\" through August 2012.[74] According to the News, Comptroller Scott Stringer \"found that Trump and [the Trump Foundation] hadn't donated a dime in the months after 9/11\"; however, because the reviewed period covered only one year after the attacks, the Comptroller's office was \"unable to conclude definitively\" that Trump never gave to the fund after August 2002.[72] According to its IRS Form 990 tax filings, the Trump Foundation made no grants to the Twin Towers Fund or to NYC Public/Private Initiatives, Inc. from 2002 through 2014, although Trump may have made personal donations after August 2002 that would not have shown up in these filings.[72]\nIn 2016, after the convention, Trump's campaign suggested that the Trump Foundation made a grant to the American Red Cross after the attacks; however, no record of it exists in the foundation's tax filings from 2001 through 2014. As with the Twin Towers Fund, if Trump instead had made a personal donation, it would not have shown up in the foundation's records.[72]\nUsing Trump Foundation money to settle Trump Organization legal disputes\n[edit]Trump may have used foundation money to settle his personal or business legal disputes on at least two occasions.\nIn 2007, Trump used Trump Foundation funds to settle a 2006 legal dispute between the Town of Palm Beach, Florida, and Trump's Mar-a-Lago country club. The town said the club's flagpole violated town height limit rules and levied a daily accruing fine against the club. The club's flagpole was 80 feet tall, 38 feet above limits imposed by the town. Palm Beach began fining Trump $1,250 per day for the violation. Trump countersued Palm Beach for $25 million on US constitutional grounds for restricting his 1st amendment rights of free speech and his 14th amendment rights of equal protection. The suit alleged that at least twenty other properties had violated the height restrictions but were not similarly fined.[75] It also alleged that a shorter flagpole \"would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump's ... patriotism\".[76] Trump eventually reached a legal settlement with Palm Beach after, according to the Sun Sentinel, \"secret, court-ordered negotiations\".[76] Settlement documents show that Trump, in return for discharging the club's obligations to Palm Beach, had agreed to personally donate $100,000 to Fischer House, a charity benefitting veterans and military families. However, Trump then made the grant using foundation money, not his own.[55][77]\nTrump's foundation paid $158,000 to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation as settlement of a suit brought by Greenberg against the Trump National Golf Club Westchester in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Greenberg alleged that he had rightfully won a $1 million prize for scoring a hole-in-one in a 2010 charity golf tournament at the club but the club had denied the award on technical grounds, arguing the hole was shorter than the required 150 yards.[34] Martin Greenberg sued and a settlement was reached at a significantly reduced amount. The Washington Post reported that \"on the day that Trump and the other parties told the court that they had settled the case, the Donald J. Trump Foundation made its first and only grant to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation, for $158,000.\"[34] In September 2016, the Post reported that the grant was directly linked to the legal settlement, likely violating IRS self-dealing rules by using charitable funds to pay Trump's personal or business obligations.[55] To raise the money needed to make the settlement, the Trump Foundation auctioned a prize of lifetime golf membership at Trump-owned golf courses, with the winning bid bringing a $157,000 donation to the Trump Foundation to the foundation to offset the payment to the Greenberg Foundation.[78] The winner of the auction may have believed he was donating to Trump Foundation charitable causes.[78]\nAccording to the Trump Foundation's publicly available tax returns, Trump National Golf Club Westchester paid over $200,000 to the Trump Foundation in 2016, with $158,000 of the funds designated as repayment of the foundation funds used toward the Martin B. Greenberg settlement.[79]\nDonation to Florida attorney general Pam Bondi\n[edit]In 2013, the Trump Foundation donated $25,000 in support of Florida attorney general Pam Bondi's election campaign while Bondi's office was reviewing fraud allegations against Trump University, a for-profit real estate program.[80] Around that time Trump also hosted a fundraiser for Bondi at his Mar-a-Lago resort at a fee well below his normal market rate.[81] Bondi's office later ended the investigation without bringing charges.[82]\nAccording to a Trump Foundation attorney, \"the [$25,000] contribution was made in error due to a case of mistaken identity of organizations with the same name.\" Trump later personally reimbursed his foundation for the $25,000. The foundation paid a $2,500 fine for violating IRS rules against political contributions by charitable organizations.[80] In 2016 New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said publicly that the Trump Foundation was the subject of an ongoing investigation by his office.[83]\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a not-for-profit watchdog group, filed a complaint with the IRS (see below). It also cast doubt on Trump's story after obtaining a letter from the Trump Foundation's attorney to the New York attorney general's office. \"We're past the point where a reasonable person could believe this is just a never-ending series of once in a lifetime errors\", said CREW Communications Director Jordan Libowitz. \"This may not be anything nefarious, but if it isn't, that would mean that the Trump operation is completely inept when it comes to running the Trump Foundation.\"[84]\nOn October 5, 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported details of how Trump had on several other occasions since as early as the 1980s made campaign donations to various US state attorneys general while they had been reviewing cases involving the Trump Organization or Trump personally, although the Bondi case is the only one it cited as having involved Trump Foundation money.[85]\nGrants allegedly made for political purposes\n[edit]Trump paid $100,000 of Trump Foundation funds in 2012 to Reverend Franklin Graham's Billy Graham Evangelical Association. NBC News has called Graham \"an early ally\" of Trump.[86] \"The more you listen to him, the more you say to yourself, 'You know, maybe the guy's right'\", Graham had told ABC News in 2011.[86] In October 2016 Graham revealed to the Charlotte Observer that in 2012 he had instructed Trump to make the $100,000 donation, and that the money was used to pay for full-page ads urging voters to support candidates in the 2012 presidential election who supported \"biblical values\". The Observer has suggested the timing and tone of the ads indicate they were placed in support of Mitt Romney's campaign.[87]\nGraham also heads Boone, North Carolina–based Samaritan's Purse, a Christian relief agency that received $25,000 from the Trump Foundation in 2012. Graham credits Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren for having solicited that donation. Van Susteren and her TV crew had accompanied Graham on Samaritan's Purse trips to Haiti and North Korea. The Charlotte Observer quoted Graham saying, \"[Trump] was on her show, and [Van Susteren] said, 'I was just in Haiti and Samaritan's Purse is doing this down there, and Donald, you need to help.' He sent a check out.\"[87] In 2016, several media outlets alleged that Van Susteren had been producing overtly pro-Trump reports on her Fox News show On the Record.[88]\nIn 2014 the Trump Foundation made a $100,000 grant to the Citizens United Foundation, a charitable foundation closely related to David Bossie's conservative group, Citizens United. At the time Citizens United was engaged in a lawsuit against New York State attorney general Eric Schneiderman, whose office was pursuing a civil suit against Trump University. It was the largest single grant made by the Trump Foundation that year.[89] Schneiderman's office called the grant part of a \"vendetta\" by Trump, while Citizens United rejected any connection between the grant and its own suit against Schneiderman.[90] The Trump Foundation's 2014 tax filing[91] misidentified Citizens United as a public charity (501(c)(3)) when it is in fact a social welfare organization (501(c)(4)).\nThe Trump Foundation donated a total of $40,000 from 2011 through 2013 to the Drumthwacket Foundation, a charitable organization formed to pay for renovation and historic preservation of the New Jersey governor's mansion of the same name. In 2011, Trump was seeking to acquire permits to build a personal cemetery on the fairway at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey[92] and may have needed political help in obtaining approval for the permit.[93]\nTrump directed $100,000 of Trump Foundation money toward the National September 11 Memorial Museum days before the 2016 New York State Republican presidential primary, where he was on the ballot, mischaracterizing the foundation grant as a personal donation.[34][94][95]\nIn May 2015, the Trump Foundation granted $10,000 to Project Veritas, a news organisation run by conservative filmmaker James O'Keefe. In October 2016, O'Keefe released video which purportedly reveals how Democrats incited violence at Trump rallies.[96] During the third 2016 presidential debate, Trump claimed that new videos produced by O'Keefe and released that week proved Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama had \"hired people\" and \"paid them $1,500\" to \"be violent, cause fights, [and] do bad things\" at Trump rallies.[96][97] A Democratic National Committee spokesman noted Trump's donation after Project Veritas released another video on the 2016 presidential election. A Project Veritas spokesman said the Trump Foundation's donation \"didn't impact our actions one way or the other\" and were a small part of the organization's budget.[98]\nTrump may have strategically directed money from the Trump Foundation to support his presidential campaign.[99] In one case, the grants were used specifically to pay for newspaper ads.[87] In October 2016 RealClearPolitics reported that Trump directed significant amounts of foundation money to conservative organizations, possibly in return for political support and access. The news organization found that, from 2011 through 2014, Trump had \"harnessed his eponymous foundation to send at least $286,000 to influential conservative or policy groups ... In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president.\" At least two of the groups are based in Republican-leaning early presidential primary states.[100] In addition to Citizens United (above), groups include Iowa's The Family Leader, the South Carolina Palmetto Family Council, the American Conservative Union, and the American Spectator Foundation.[86][101] Trump's granting of foundation money to these groups could have violated the law, if it was in return for his personal right to speak or gain access to networking events.[102]\n- The Trump Foundation's grant of $10,000 in 2013 to The Family Leader may have led to a speaking engagement for Trump. The Family Leader is an Iowa-based organization whose stated mission is to \"strengthen families, by inspiring Christ-like leadership in the home, the church, and the government\".[103] Following the grant, the group's leader, Vader Plaats, invited Trump to speak at its leadership summit.[86] These grants may also have been illegal because The Family Leader is a 501(c)(4) corporation established to \"develop, advocate and support legislative agenda at the state level\" and not a charity. The Trump Foundation is prohibited from donating money for non-charity purposes. However, Trump may have intended to make a grant to The Family Leader's affiliated foundation, The Family Leader Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation.[100]\n- Trump was invited to speak at the American Conservative Union's Conservative Political Action Conference (\"CPAC\") in 2013 after directing $50,000 of Trump Foundation money to the organization. Also in 2013, Trump was invited to speak to the Economic Club of Washington after the Trump Foundation made a grant there.[100]\nPartial payment of an assessment owed by the Plaza Hotel\n[edit]In 1989, the Trump Foundation paid more than half a \"voluntary assessment\" imposed on the Plaza Hotel by the Central Park Conservancy. The hotel was owned by the Trump Organization at the time and the assessment was for the renovation of the severely dilapidated Pulitzer Fountain at Grand Army Plaza, which directly faced the hotel. Toward the $500,000 assessment, the foundation granted $264,631 to the Conservancy while the Trump Organization paid between $100,000 and $250,000. The grant to the Conservancy was the largest single grant made by the Trump Foundation from inception through at least 2015.[32]\nPurchasing goods and services for personal or business benefit with foundation money\n[edit]- On three occasions, Trump used the foundation's money to purchase artists' portraits of himself.\n- In 2007, Trump spent $20,000 in Trump Foundation funds to purchase a six-foot-tall portrait of himself by artist Michael Israel at a benefit for a Florida charity, the Children's Place at Homespace,[104] held at his Mar-a-Lago country club in Florida after his wife Melania Trump made the highest bid.[56][77][105] The painter's former production manager told The Washington Post that he had, at the request of Trump's wife Melania, shipped the painting to the Trump National Golf Club Westchester in Briarcliff Manor, New York, allegedly for display in the country club's boardroom or conference room.[56] The charity paid half the proceeds, $10,000, to the artist for the painting, which established that the painting had a fair market value of at least that amount.[106] Tax experts told the Post that if it was displayed at the golf club, it could violate Internal Revenue Service rules prohibiting non-profits from self-dealing, i.e. charitable funding of a noncharitable purpose.[56] In September 2016, President Barack Obama publicly criticized Trump's purchase of the painting.[56][105]\n- In 2019, former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen testified to the House Committee on Oversight that in 2013 Trump had used a straw purchaser, billionaire Stewart Rahr, to ensure a portrait of himself would be sold for the highest price. Rahr paid $60,000 for a 9-foot tall portrait of Trump by artist William Quigley. He was reimbursed with money from the Trump Foundation. After the sale, Trump tweeted \"Just found out that at a charity auction of celebrity portraits in E. Hampton, my portrait by artist William Quigley topped the list at $60K.\" Trump kept the painting.[107]\n- In 2014, at a charity for the Unicorn Children's Foundation, held at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump purchased a four-foot-tall portrait of himself in the 1990s by Argentine artist Havi Schanz and paid for it with $20,000 of Trump Foundation funds.[55][77] A photo of the portrait was found on a TripAdvisor review of Trump National Doral Miami. Later, a reporter for Univision went to the club, asked the various staff about the painting and eventually discovered it hanging on a wall at the golf resort's Champions Bar & Grill restaurant.[108] Trump presidential campaign spokesperson Boris Epshteyn said that Trump's use of the painting at Trump's Champions Bar & Grill was not \"absolutely proper\" under an IRS rule allowing individuals to store items \"on behalf of the foundation—in order to help with storage costs\" and that Trump was \"doing his foundation a favor\" by using the portrait on the restaurant wall.[109]\n- In 2008, Trump used $107,000 of Trump Foundation funds to purchase a luxury trip to Paris, including a meeting with actress Salma Hayek, at a charity auction for the Gucci Foundation.[77]\n- In 2012, Trump bid $12,000 at a charity auction, hosted at his Mar-a-lago club, to purchase an NFL football helmet autographed by Tim Tebow, as well as a Tebow jersey. While Trump was given credit for personal generosity in newspaper accounts, the purchase was made with foundation money, not his own.[110] The current whereabouts of the helmet and jersey are unknown. Tax law experts say if Trump kept them, the purchase might have violated the self-dealing rule, which bans private foundations from \"the furnishing of goods\" to their officers.[23]\n- The Palm Beach Post has suggested that Trump benefited personally when the Trump Foundation made grants totaling $20,000 during 2012 through 2014 in return for band and choir performances held at his resorts.[111]\n- In 2013, the Trump Foundation made a $5,000 grant to the non-profit D.C. Preservation League. According to The Washington Post, the nonprofit's support helped the Trump Organization obtain the rights to convert Washington, D.C.'s historic Old Post Office Pavilion into the Trump International Hotel. In acknowledgment of the donation, the Trump Foundation received ads in the event programs; the ads promoted Trump's hotels rather than the foundation, in possible violation of IRS self-dealing rules.[55]\nDiversion of taxable income to the foundation as donations\n[edit]The Washington Post reported in September 2016 that Donald Trump had directed that $2.3 million owed to him and his organization by various people and organizations should be paid instead to his foundation as donations, possibly evading personal income taxes.[57] The Post found old Associated Press coverage showing that Trump may have started directing income to the Trump Foundation as early as 1989. IRS rules prohibit individuals from diverting taxable income owed to them toward charities if they benefit directly from those charities unless the individual declares the income on his tax forms.[57] Since Trump had yet to release his income taxes at that time, the Post was unable to confirm if the income was declared for any of the donations received.[57]\nThe Trump Foundation received at least $1.9 million from ticket broker Richard Ebers. Richard Ebers had bought goods and services, including tickets, from \"Trump or his businesses\"; he was allegedly instructed to make payment for them to the Trump Foundation in the form of charitable contributions instead of as income for the Trump organization.[57]\nThe Trump Foundation received a total of $5 million in donations from World Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon and his wife Linda McMahon from 2007 to 2009.[57] Trump appeared twice in WrestleMania events, in 2007 and again in 2009. One donation to the foundation was $4 million in 2007; the second was $1 million in 2009. The WWE later told The Huffington Post that \"during this period, WWE paid Donald Trump appearance fees separately\", and \"separately, [WWE chief executives] Vince and Linda McMahon made personal donations to Donald Trump's foundation\".[112]\nIn 2007, the Celebrity Fight Night Foundation hosted a fundraiser to benefit the Muhammad Ali Parkinson's Center in Phoenix, Arizona. According to a Celebrity Fight Night Foundation spokesperson, in return for Trump's appearance and his offering a New York–based dinner with himself at auction, Trump stipulated that the Parkinson's charity share the total auction proceeds with the Trump Foundation. The Trump Foundation subsequently received $150,000 of auction proceeds that would otherwise have gone to the center benefitting Parkinson's disease research.[112]\nOther donations made to the Trump Foundation that may have been in return for Trump's personal work include:\n- $400,000 from Comedy Central as payment for Trump's attendance at a celebrity roast in his honor.[57]\n- $150,000 from People Magazine in return for exclusive photos of Trump's son, Barron Trump.[101]\n- $500,000 from NBC Universal in 2012 while the network was airing Trump's show, The Apprentice.[113]\n- $100,000 from the family of Donna Clancy, whose family law office had been renting space at the Trump Organization's 40 Wall Street building.[112]\n- $100,000 in 2005 for work by Trump's wife Melania for Norwegian Cruise Lines for a segment that was later included in Trump's show, The Apprentice. A spokeswoman for the company confirmed that the appearance fee to Melania was paid in the form of a donation to the Trump Foundation.[112]\nGranting money to charities that rented Trump Organization facilities\n[edit]Trump has been accused of directing foundation money toward several charities that in turn paid the Trump Organization to host charity events at Trump-owned hotels and golf clubs.[78] High-profile charity events at Mar-a-Lago cost as much as $300,000.[114]\nSome examples:\n- In 2010, Trump was personally honored for his support by the Palm Beach Police Foundation after the Trump Foundation donated to the charity $150,000 during the period of 2009–2010.[31] According to the police foundation's public tax records, Palm Beach Police Foundation paid the Trump Organization $276,463 in rent in 2014 for its \"Police Ball and Auction\"[115] which was held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago hotel.[31] The 2014 tax form also lists $44,332 in unattributed \"direct expenses\" paid by the police foundation for the same event as well as $36,608 in \"direct expenses\" for its annual \"Golf Classic\", which the police foundation holds annually at a Trump Organization-owned golf course.[115][116] For each of the four years prior to 2014, the police foundation's public tax records show significant \"direct expenses\" incurred for both the tournament and the Ball and Auction, although expense categories are not cited in the filings.[115]\n- In 2013, according to The Washington Post, Trump donated $10,000 to the V Foundation, a cancer-fighting group founded by former basketball coach Jim Valvano, in return for the V Foundation holding a fundraiser at his Trump Winery in Virginia.[34]\n- The Dana–Farber Cancer Institute paid the Trump Organization substantial fees to hold annual events at Mar-A-Lago. The Trump Foundation in turn granted to the Institute a total of $85,000 for 2006 and 2007, among other grants in subsequent years.[114][117][118][119]\nTrump taking personal credit for donations made using foundation money\n[edit]Both The Washington Post and Fox News reported that Trump repeatedly claimed in public, beginning in 2015, to have made over \"$102 million\" in charitable donations \"in the past five years\". The Trump Organization provided journalists with a 93-page list of the donations. None of the cash donations were confirmed to come from Trump himself; many were actually grants from the Trump Foundation.[34][120][121]\nFor example, Trump took personal credit and was honored for a Trump Foundation grant to the Palm Beach Police Foundation that was actually from an outside source (see above). He had pledged the money personally, and then the Trump Foundation solicited the $150,000 earmarked for the police foundation from an unrelated philanthropic organization, the Charles Evans Foundation. The Trump Foundation then paid the Palm Beach charity.[31] The police then honored Trump personally with its annual Palm Tree Award at Trump's Mar-a-Lago hotel at its annual fundraiser.[122] The Washington Post wrote that \"Trump had effectively turned the Evans Foundation's gifts into his gifts, without adding any money of his own.\"[123]\nThe Dana–Farber Cancer Institute has honored Trump variously as \"Grand Benefactor\" and \"Grand Honorary Chair\" at its annual fundraisers held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump may have also earned more money on the event fees it received from the institute than the Trump Foundation paid to the institute in grants. Trump has directed at least $300,000 of grants of the Trump Foundation money to Dana-Farber since 2010.[124]\nTrump received highly visible praise for his generosity on his prime-time television show The Apprentice. He frequently offered to make generous donations to his contestants' charities, but records show that he ultimately either directed the Trump Foundation to make a grant or had the show's network, NBC Universal, make the donation.[34] Examples include:\n- A 2008 episode where Trump told contestant and mixed-martial arts star Tito Ortiz: \"I think you're so incredible that—personally, out of my account—I'm going to give you $50,000 for St. Jude's [children's hospital],\" Ortiz's chosen charity and also a favorite named charity of Trump's son, Eric. Trump then had the Trump Foundation make a $50,000 grant to St. Jude Children's Hospital.[125]\n- In 2012 Trump promised at least six personal donations of $10,000 each to contestants' chosen charities during one episode of Celebrity Apprentice. In another episode of the same season, he pledged $10,000 to contestant Aubrey O'Day's chosen charity, a gift \"that moved [contestant and comedienne Lisa] Lampanelli to tears.\"[125] According to The Washington Post's review of tax filings, Trump directed all this money to be granted to the charities out of Trump Foundation funds.[125]\n- In 2013 Trump promised personal donations of $20,000 each to the charities of basketball star Dennis Rodman, singer La Toya Jackson, former Playboy Playmate Brande Roderick, and actor Gary Busey during episodes of The Celebrity Apprentice. Trump then used Trump Foundation money to make the payments.[125] \"Remember, Donald Trump is a very nice person, okay?\" he told them. According to a Washington Post reporter, who reviewed transcripts of the show, by 2013 \"contestants had come to expect these gifts—and even to demand them when Trump didn't offer money on his own\".[125]\n- A gift to Starkey Hearing Foundation, a charity chosen by an actress Marlee Matlin. Trump was credited with a personal donation of at least $14,000,[126] but the donation came from the Trump Foundation.[125]\nOther alleged examples include:\n- Trump using foundation money to pay the personal bills of a viewer of the TV show Extra. In 2009 he appeared on the show and promised he would pay a struggling viewer's domestic bills. \"This is a bad time for a lot of people\", Trump said as the contest was announced. Trump eventually paid the winner with Trump Foundation money.[34] A Trump representative later explained that the grant was legal because the winner qualified as an \"indigent\" individual under Internal Revenue Code section 4945(d)(3), a contention at least one tax expert has disputed.\n- Trump being honored with a chair and plaque in his name at the Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts after the Trump Foundation donated $10,000.[127]\n- Trump taking personal credit for a $25,000 grant from the Trump Foundation at a speech honoring slain journalist James Foley in 2014. At the time, the New Hampshire Union Leader published an article titled \"Trump leads tribute for slain journalist James Foley\". Foley was posthumously awarded the 12th annual Nackey S. Loeb First Amendment Award, \"given annually to New Hampshire organizations or residents who protect or exemplify the liberties listed in the First Amendment to the Constitution\". Trump was the \"featured speaker of the event\".[95][128]\n- Trump receiving personal praise for a $100,000 Trump Foundation grant in 2016 to the National September 11 Memorial Museum ahead of the 2016 New York State Republican Primary (above).[95]\nMaking grants to other private foundations without fulfilling IRS \"expenditure responsibility\" rules\n[edit]The Trump Foundation is responsible by law for ensuring that any grant it makes to another private foundation is used strictly for charitable purposes. To fulfill this IRS \"expenditure responsibility\" the foundation is required to attach \"full and detailed\" reports describing the use of the grant money to its IRS 990 tax return for each year a grant to a private foundation is made.[129] Trump Foundation tax returns show that it failed to do this for all twenty of the grants it made to private foundations during the period of 2005 through 2014. Such grants in this period, which total at least $488,500, could be subject to significant fines and penalties.[129][130]\nReceiving donation from Ukrainian oligarch during campaign for president\n[edit]In 2015, Ukrainian Victor Pinchuk made a $150,000 donation to the Trump Foundation in return for Trump's appearance by video conference link at the Yalta European Strategy Conference. The appearance was broadcast on a large screen and lasted only twenty minutes, including delays caused by translation and by technical difficulties. Pinchuk is the son-in-law of former Ukrainian president Lionid Kuchma. In 2018 The New York Times reported that the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller was investigating the donation as a possible illegal in-kind campaign contribution from a foreign national intended to curry favor with then-candidate Trump.[131][132]\nLegal actions and closure\n[edit]Intended dissolution of the Trump Foundation\n[edit]In September and October 2016 there were several legal actions and complaints filed against the Trump Foundation. The former head of the Internal Revenue Service's Office of Exempt Organizations Division Marc Owens told The Washington Post regarding the various allegations against the foundation: \"This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues ... It's the first time I've ever seen this, and I've been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total.\"[57]\nIn late December 2016, one month before his inauguration, Trump announced that he would dissolve the Trump Foundation to avoid \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President\".[41] However, a spokesperson from the New York State attorney general's office told The New York Times, the same month, that the foundation \"cannot legally dissolve\" until its current investigation is completed.[42]\nInvestigation by New York State attorney general's office\n[edit]Initial investigations and notice of violation\n[edit]On September 13, 2016, New York State attorney general Eric Schneiderman announced that his office was investigating the foundation \"to make sure it's complying with the laws governing charities in New York.\"[39][40] The office had previously filed charges—at that time awaiting trial—against the Trump Organization's Trump University. Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, responded to the announcement by labeling Schneiderman a \"partisan hack\".[133] Schneiderman has endorsed Hillary Clinton and was identified as a member of her \"New York leadership council\" in October 2015.[133][134]\nOn September 30, 2016, the attorney general's office issued a \"Notice of Violation\" to the Trump Foundation, ordering it to immediately stop all fundraising in New York and to file its registration and all required past audits within 15 days, or risk being \"deemed to be a continuing fraud on the people of the State of New York\".[135] Under the law, the foundation may eventually be required to return all donations it had solicited since inception.[62][135][136][137] The notice said the foundation has not complied with New York law because it had failed to re-register in New York State as a \"7A level charitable organization\", as required for charities that solicit $25,000 or more a year from outside donors. The Trump Foundation had been registered in New York under the state's Estates, Powers and Trusts Law with a designation intended for self-funded private foundations.[62][135]\nOn October 17 a spokesperson for the attorney general's office confirmed that the Trump Foundation had agreed to cease solicitation of donations in New York State. The Trump Foundation was at the time granted an extension of time for filing its financial paperwork, including all past audits.[138][139] The attorney general's office said the Trump Foundation also agreed to cooperate with their ongoing investigation.[140] The attorney general's press secretary said Trump could not legally dissolve his foundation until the investigation is finished.[141]\nAdmission of self-dealing\n[edit]In 2016, while under investigation by the New York State Attorney General's office), the Trump Foundation admitted on its IRS Form 990 for 2015 that it had, in previous years, engaged in self-dealing and had transferred \"income or assets to disqualified persons\" (which could be a Trump family member, a Trump-owned business, or Donald Trump himself). The foundation did not provide specifics. Under tax law, the violations can lead to penalties, such as the imposition of excise taxes or repayment of the improperly spent monies.[142]\nNew York State litigation against Trump Foundation and Trump family\n[edit]| People v. Trump | |\n|---|---|\n| Court | New York Supreme Court, County of New York |\n| Full case name | People of the State of New York, by Barbara D. Underwood, Attorney General of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric F. Trump, and The Donald J. Trump Foundation[143] |\n| Court membership | |\n| Judge sitting | Justice Saliann Scarpulla |\nOn June 14, 2018, the new New York attorney general Barbara Underwood filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump himself, and Trump's adult children—Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr.—alleging they had engaged in \"extensive unlawful political conduct\" and that Donald Trump had been using the foundation \"as his personal checkbook\" to, among other things, settle his personal legal debts and support his presidential campaign.[144][44] The suit sought $2.8 million in restitution and the dissolution of the foundation.[145][146] The suit noted that Trump himself made all decisions about disbursement of foundation funds and that the board of directors had not met for 18 years.[147] Underwood's office also referred suspected Federal campaign and tax law violations to the Federal Election Commission and to the IRS.[43]\nOn August 30, 2018, Trump attorney Alan Futerfas filed a motion to dismiss Underwood's suit, claiming it was without merit and was a result of \"pervasive bias\" by former New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who had supervised the investigation before resigning that May. On October 4, 2018, Attorney General Underwood filed a memorandum opposing the motion, instead of strengthening the charges against the Trump Foundation and now alleging, among other claims, that the full $2.8 million of distributions resulting from the January 2016 Iowa fundraiser represented illegal campaign contributions that needed to be repaid.[66] The memorandum also stated that the foundation had engaged in \"persistent illegality\", adding \"Trump used his control over the ... Foundation for his benefit to advance his personal, business, and political interests in violation of federal and state law governing charities.\"[69]\nOn October 25, 2018, Justice Saliann Scarpulla heard a hearing on the motion. Justice Scarpulla suggested that she would wait to issue a ruling on the motion until the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division issued a decision in a separate case (a defamation suit brought by Summer Zervos against Trump) on the issue of whether a sitting U.S. president may be sued in state court at all.[148][149] On November 23, 2018, Scarpulla denied Trump's motion to dismiss, affirming that a sitting U.S. president can face \"a civil lawsuit in state court for actions not taken in his official capacity\" and citing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v. Jones (1997).[150]\nOn November 7, 2019, Scarpulla ordered Trump to pay a $2 million settlement for misusing the foundation for his business and political purposes, directing the settlement money to be given to a handful of charities. The foundation characterized the payment to the charities as a \"contribution,\" stating it was \"pleased to donate an additional $2 million\" to \"worthy organizations.\"[15][52] The attorney general had asked the court for an order dissolving the charity and imposing $2.8 million in restitution and penalties. She had also made referrals to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).[28] On June 18, New York governor Andrew Cuomo's office announced that the governor would refer the civil case to New York's Department of Taxation and Finance if it is requested to do so by the attorney general's office.[44] Given the violations alleged in the civil case, some experts believe a tax investigation could lead to state criminal charges.[44][151]\nDissolution of foundation\n[edit]On December 18, 2018, Underwood announced that the foundation had agreed to shut down under court supervision and distribute its remaining assets to court-approved charities, although the attorney general's office would continue its investigations of and legal actions against the foundation and its directors.[14]\nInvestigation by New York State Department of Taxation and Finance\n[edit]Separately, in July 2018, the case was referred to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance.[44] In August 2018, the department issued a subpoena to Michael Cohen, formerly Trump's personal attorney, in connection with the case.[152][153]\nOffice of the Special Counsel investigation\n[edit]On April 9, 2018, The New York Times reported that the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of its larger investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election, was investigating the Trump Foundation's donation of $150,000 by Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk in 2015.[131] The Times reported that Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had solicited the donation from Pinchuk in return for Trump's appearance in a 20-minute video conference with Pinchuk and others in Kyiv in September 2015, just a few months after Trump launched his presidential campaign.[131][154] The investigation was part of a broader investigation into foreign influence into the campaign. Federal election law prohibits non-U.S. nationals from contributing to U.S. political campaigns.[132]\nUS House Judiciary Committee investigations\n[edit]On September 13, 2016, all fifteen Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, then in the minority, sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch requesting that the Justice Department launch a criminal investigation of Trump in connection with his foundation's $25,000 grant to Pam Bondi's campaign. The letter specifically cited possible violations of two anti-bribery laws.[155]\nOn March 4, 2019, new House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler issued a subpoena to the Trump Foundation for copies of a broad range of documents it had previously delivered to Robert Mueller's office or any other domestic law enforcement agency on or after November 8, 2016, the day of Trump's election. The request specifically focused on domestic emoluments and contact with Russia-related entities or people.[156]\nOther complaints\n[edit]Also on September 13, 2016, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a left-leaning watchdog group, filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service citing evidence they argued would compel the agency to seek back taxes and penalties and revoke the foundation's tax-free status.[155][157]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"Form 990 2015\".

Trump,\nTrump Children, and Trump Foundation\nAG James Achieves Restitution of Misused Funds, Dissolution of Foundation, and Restrictions on Charitable Activity After Donald J. Trump’s Abuse of the Trump Foundation\nTrump to Pay $2 Million in Damages for Illegal Activity During 2016 Election\nNEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today announced that the New York Supreme Court ordered Donald J. Trump to pay $2 million in damages for improperly using charitable assets to intervene in the 2016 presidential primaries and further his own political interests. The award is part of Attorney General James’ lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation and its directors — Mr. Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump.\nAs part of the settlement, Attorney General James also announced that her office entered into multiple stipulations with the Trump Foundation and its directors to resolve the remaining claims in the lawsuit. Chiefly, Mr. Trump admits to personally misusing funds at the Trump Foundation, and agrees to restrictions on future charitable service and ongoing reporting to the Office of the Attorney General in the event he creates a new charity. The settlements also include mandatory training requirements for Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Finally, the settlements name the charities that will receive the remaining assets of the Trump Foundation as part of its dissolution.\n“The Trump Foundation has shut down, funds that were illegally misused are being restored, the president will be subject to ongoing supervision by my office, and the Trump children had to undergo compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again,” said Attorney General James. “The court’s decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain. My office will continue to fight for accountability because no one is above the law — not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the President of the United States.”\nThe lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation was filed in June 2018 — charging the Foundation’s directors with ignoring their oversight duties under New York’s charity laws and demonstrating how Mr. Trump repeatedly used Foundation money for his own personal, business, and political interests, including the unlawful coordination with his 2016 presidential campaign. In the first half of 2016 — at the height of the Republican primaries — Mr. Trump used Foundation money, raised from the public, to demonstrate his purported generosity and attract votes. Mr. Trump and his campaign doled out $500,000 at a campaign rally in the days leading up to the first primary election in the nation, the Iowa caucuses, then took credit for all $2.8 million in grants the Foundation made.\nIn her decision ordering Mr. Trump to pay $2 million, Justice Saliann Scarpulla said, “…Mr. Trump breached his fiduciary duty to the Foundation and that waste occurred to the Foundation. Mr. Trump’s fiduciary duty breaches included allowing his campaign to orchestrate the Fundraiser, allowing his campaign, instead of the Foundation, to direct distribution of the Funds, and using the Fundraiser and distribution of the Funds to further Mr. Trump’s political campaign.”\nIn total, the Office of the Attorney General has entered into four stipulation agreements as part of this settlement.\nLast year, in December 2018, following a court decision in favor of the Attorney General’s Office, the first stipulation took effect when the Trump Foundation agreed to shutter its doors and dissolve under court supervision. In October 2019, the Office of the Attorney General entered three additional stipulations. One stipulation ensures that the Foundation’s remaining assets will go to reputable charities approved by Attorney General James and that have no connection to Mr. Trump or his family members. Another stipulation ensures that Donald Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump received training on the duties of officers and directors of charities so that they cannot allow the illegal activity they oversaw at the Trump Foundation to take place again.\nThe third stipulation includes 19 paragraphs of factual admissions by Mr. Trump and the Foundation of illegal activity. Mr. Trump admitted that the Foundation’s board of directors — of which he was chair — failed to meet, failed to provide oversight over the Foundation, and failed to adopt legally required policies and procedures. He also admitted that these failures “contributed to the Foundation’s participation” in seven related party transactions described in the settlement document and in the Attorney General’s lawsuit.\nMr. Trump and the Foundation have admitted key facts about their illegal political coordination with the Trump campaign, including that a purported Foundation fundraiser in January 2016 was in fact a campaign event, and that Foundation gave the Trump campaign complete control over the timing, amounts, and recipients of the $2.8 million raised through that event. Mr. Trump further admits that he and his campaign took credit for the grants that the Foundation made with funds that had been raised from the public. Justice Scarpulla noted in her decision that “Mr. Trump’s campaign, rather than the Foundation: (1) ‘planned’ and ‘organized’ the Fundraiser; and (2) ‘directed the timing, amounts, and recipients of the Foundation’s grants to charitable organizations supporting military veterans.’”\nAdditionally, Mr. Trump admitted a number of key facts about the other self-dealing transactions he initiated as chair — specifically, that he used Foundation funds to settle legal obligations of companies he controlled, and that the Foundation paid for a portrait of Mr. Trump that cost $10,000. As separate piece of the settlement Donald Trump Jr. reimbursed the Foundation for the cost of the portrait. The settlement also requires the Foundation to be reimbursed $11,525 for sports paraphernalia and champagne purchased at a charity gala.\nFinally, the settlement agreement imposes a regime of restrictions on any future service by Mr. Trump on a charity’s board of directors, including a total ban on any self-dealing. Any charity he joins as a director must have a majority of independent directors, must engage counsel with expertise in New York not-for-profit law, and must engage the services of an accounting firm to monitor and audit the organization’s grants and expenses. If Mr. Trump forms a new charity, such an organization must comply with these requirements, and also report to the Office of the Attorney General for five years.\nThe $1.78 million in assets currently being held by the Trump Foundation, along with the $2 million in damages to be paid by Mr. Trump, will be disbursed equally to eight charities: Army Emergency Relief, the Children’s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha’s Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of National Capital Area, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. The charities — which were required as part of the resolution to be entities that did not have any relationship with Mr. Trump or entities he controlled — were approved by the Office of the Attorney General and the court.\nThis case was handled by Assistant Attorney General Yael Fuchs, Co-Chief of the Enforcement Section of the Charities Bureau; Assistant Attorneys General Steven Shiffman and Peggy Farber of the Charities Bureau; with assistance from Senior Counsel Matthew Colangelo and former Special Counsel Laura Wood. James Sheehan is the Chief of the Charities Bureau, and Karin Kunstler Goldman is the Deputy Chief. The Charities Bureau is a bureau of the Division of Social Justice, headed by Chief Deputy Attorney General Meghan Faux.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Thank you for your patience and we will share an update on CoreStandards.org when we have one.\nEnglish Language Arts Standards\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Common Core\nThe Common Core State Standards Initiative, also known as simply Common Core, is an American, multi-state educational initiative which began in 2010 with the goal of increasing consistency across state standards, or what K–12 students throughout the United States should know in English language arts and mathematics at the conclusion of each school grade. The initiative was sponsored by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers.\nThe initiative also sought to provide states and schools with articulated expectations around the skills students graduating from high school needed in order to be prepared to enter credit-bearing courses at two- or four-year college programs or to enter the workforce.[1]\nBackground\n[edit]In the 1990s, a movement began in the U.S. to establish national educational standards for students across the country.\n- (a) outlining what students were expected to know and do at each grade level\n- (b) implementing ways to find out if they were meeting those standards.[2]\nDevelopment\n[edit]In late 2008, the NGA convened a group to work on developing the standards.[3] This team included David Coleman, William McCallum of the University of Arizona, Phil Daro, Douglas Clements and Student Achievement Partners founders Jason Zimba[4] and Susan Pimentel to write standards in the areas of English language arts and mathematics.[5] Announced on June 1, 2009,[6] the initiative's stated purpose was to \"provide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to learn, so teachers and parents know what they need to do to help them\".[7] Additionally, \"The standards are designed to be robust and relevant to the real world, reflecting the knowledge and skills that our young people need for success in college and careers\", which should place American students in a position in which they can compete in a global economy.[7]\nWork groups composed of representatives from higher education, K-12 education, teachers, and researchers drafted the Common Core State Standards. The work groups consulted educators, administrators, community and parent organizations, higher education representatives, the business community, researchers, civil rights groups, and states for feedback on each of the drafts.[8]\nThe standards are copyrighted by NGA Center for Best Practices (NGA Center) and the CCSSO, which controls use of and licenses the standards.[9] The NGA Center and CCSSO do this by offering a public license which is used by State Departments of Education.[10] The license states that use of the standards must be \"in support\" of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. It also requires attribution and a copyright notice, except when a state or territory has adopted the standards \"in whole\".\nWhen the CCSS was originally published, there was no intention to publish a common set of standards for English language proficiency development (ELPD). Instead, it was indicated that the ELPD standards would be left to individual states.[11] However, the need for more guidance quickly became apparent, and led to the creation of several initiatives to provide resources to states and educators, including:\n- WIDA, which is a consortium that produces standardized tests aimed at English Language Learners (ELLs), more properly known as English as an Additional Language (EAL) students, that is used in multiple states. It is still updating its standards in order to align with CCSS.[12]\n- An English language proficiency development framework from The Council of Chief State School Officers, which assists states in revising their ELPD standards to align to both the CSS and Next Generation Science Standards.[11]\n- Both the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) and the TESOL International Association are involved in establishing the standards for ESL instruction, but as of yet there is not a standardized set of qualifications across the country for ESL instruction.[12]\nThe U.S. Department of Education has since funded two grants to develop the next generation of ELPD assessments, which must measure students’ proficiency against a set of common ELPD standards, which in turn correspond to the college/career-ready standards in English language arts and mathematics.[11] The new assessment system must also:\n- Be based on a common definition of English language learner adopted by all consortium states.\n- Include diagnostic (e.g., screener, placement) and summative assessments.\n- Assess English language proficiency across the four language domains (reading, writing, speaking, and listening) for each grade level from kindergarten through grade 12.\n- Produce results that indicate whether individual students have attained a level and complexity of English language proficiency that is necessary to fully participate in academic instruction in English.\n- Be accessible to all ELLs, except those who are eligible for alternate assessments based on alternate academic standards.\n- Use technology to the maximum extent appropriate to develop, administer, and score assessments.[11]\nAdoption\n[edit]41 states and the District of Columbia joined the Common Core State Standards Initiative; Alabama, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, Alaska, Nebraska, Indiana and South Carolina did not.[13] Minnesota adopted the English Language Arts standards but not the Mathematics standards.[14] Following pushback and reductions in financial support, the project lost momentum and at least 12 states introducing legislation to prohibit implementation.[15] Eventually, multiple states that initially adopted the Common Core Standards decided to repeal or replace them including Indiana, Arizona, Oklahoma,[16] South Carolina, and Florida also abandoned the standard.[17] New York State would eventually replace their version of the Common Core Standards with The Next Generation Learning Standards.[18]\nStandards were released for mathematics and English language arts on June 2, 2010, with a majority of states adopting the standards in the subsequent months. States were given an incentive to adopt the Common Core Standards through the possibility of competitive federal Race to the Top grants. U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced the Race to the Top competitive grants on July 24, 2009, as a motivator for education reform. To be eligible, states had to adopt \"internationally benchmarked standards and assessments that prepare students for success in college and the work place.\"[19] Though states could adopt other college- and career-ready standards and still be eligible, they were awarded extra points in their Race to the Top applications if they adopted the Common Core standards by August 2, 2010. Forty-one states made the promise in their application.[20][21] Virginia and Texas were two states that chose to write their own college and career-ready standards, and were subsequently eligible for Race to the Top. Development of the Common Core Standards was funded by the governors and state schools chiefs, with additional support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Pearson Publishing Company, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, and others.[22]\nThe Every Student Succeeds Act, passed in December 2015, replaced No Child Left Behind Act, and prohibited the Department of Education from attempting to \"influence, incentivize, or coerce State adoption of the Common Core State Standards ... or any other academic standards common to a significant number of States.\"[23]\nOther content areas adopted a national approach to learning standards, such as the Next Generation Science Standards, released in April 2012[24] and were subsequently adopted by many states. They are not directly related to the Common Core standards, but their content can be cross-connected to the mathematical and English Language Arts standards within the Common Core.[25][26]\nEnglish Language Arts standards\n[edit]The stated goal of the English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects standards[27] is to ensure that students are college and career ready in literacy no later than the end of high school. There are five key components to the standards for English and Language Arts: Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Language, and Media and Technology.[28] The essential components and breakdown of each of these key points within the standards are as follows:\n- Reading\n- As students advance through each grade, there is an increased level of complexity to what students are expected to read and there is also a progressive development of reading comprehension so that students can gain more from what they read.[28]\n- Teachers, school districts, and states are expected to decide on the appropriate curriculum, but sample texts are included.[28] Molly Walsh of Burlington Free Press notes an appendix (of state standards for reading material) that lists \"exemplar texts\" from works by noted authors such as Ovid, Voltaire, William Shakespeare, Ivan Turgenev, Edgar Allan Poe, Robert Frost, W. B. Yeats, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and the more contemporary, including, Amy Tan, Atul Gawande and Julia Alvarez.[29]\n- There is some critical content for all students – classic myths and stories from around the world, foundational U.S. documents, seminal works of American literature, and the writings of Shakespeare – but the rest is left up to the states and the districts.[28]\n- Standards for Reading Foundational Skills are described for kindergarten to grade five. They include the areas of print concepts, phonological awareness, phonics and word recognition, and fluency.[30] Specific teaching suggestions and research are contained in the Appendices, where “phonics” is referred to as “Phoneme-Grapheme Correspondences”.[31]\n- Writing\n- The driving force of the writing standards is logical arguments based on claims, solid reasoning, and relevant evidence. The writing also includes opinion writing even within the K–5 standards.[28]\n- Short, focused research projects, similar to the kind of projects students will face in their careers, as well as long-term, in-depth research is another piece of the writing standards. This is because written analysis and the presentation of significant findings are critical to career and college readiness.[28]\n- The standards also include annotated samples of student writing to help determine performance levels in writing arguments, explanatory texts, and narratives across the grades.[28]\n- Speaking and listening\n- Although reading and writing are the expected components of an English language arts curriculum, standards are written so that students gain, evaluate, and present complex information, ideas, and evidence specifically through listening and speaking.[28]\n- There is also an emphasis on academic discussion in one-on-one, small-group, and whole-class settings, which can take place as formal presentations or informal discussions during student collaboration.[28]\n- Language\n- Vocabulary instruction in the standards takes place through a mix of conversations, direct instruction, and reading so that students can determine word meanings and can expand their use of words and phrases.[28]\n- The standards expect students to use formal English in their writing and speaking, but also recognize that colleges and 21st-century careers will require students to make wise, skilled decisions about how to express themselves through language in a variety of contexts.[28]\n- Vocabulary and conventions are their own strand because these skills extend across reading, writing, speaking, and listening.[28]\n- Media and technology\n- Since media and technology are intertwined with every student's life and in school in the 21st century, skills related to media use, which includes the analysis and production of various forms of media, are also included in these standards.[28]\n- The standards include instruction in keyboarding,[32] but do not mandate the teaching of cursive handwriting.[33]\nMathematics standards\n[edit]The stated goal of the mathematics standards is to achieve greater focus and coherence in the curriculum.[34] This is largely in response to the criticism that American mathematics curricula are \"a mile wide and an inch deep\".[35]\nThe mathematics standards include Standards for Mathematical Practice and Standards for Mathematical Content.\nStandards for Mathematical Practice\n[edit]| Example: Sixth practice |\n|---|\n| Attend to precision (Full text) |\n| Mathematically proficient students try to communicate precisely to others. They try to use clear definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of measure, and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. They calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context. In the elementary grades, students give carefully formulated explanations to each other. By the time they reach high school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use of definitions.[36] |\nThe Standards mandate that eight principles of mathematical practice be taught:[37]\n- Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.\n- Reason abstractly and quantitatively.\n- Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.\n- Model with mathematics.\n- Use appropriate tools strategically.\n- Attend to precision.\n- Look for and make use of structure.\n- Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.\nThe practices are adapted from the five process standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the five strands of proficiency in the U.S. National Research Council's Adding It Up report.[38] These practices are to be taught in every grade from kindergarten to twelfth grade. Details of how these practices are to be connected to each grade level's mathematics content are left to local implementation of the Standards.\nStandards for Mathematical Content\n[edit]The standards lay out the mathematics content that should be learned at each grade level from kindergarten to Grade 8 (age 13–14), as well as the mathematics to be learned in high school. The standards do not dictate any particular pedagogy or what order topics should be taught within a particular grade level. Mathematical content is organized in a number of domains. At each grade level there are several standards for each domain, organized into clusters of related standards.\n| Domain | Kindergarten | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | Grade 4 | Grade 5 | Grade 6 | Grade 7 | Grade 8 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Counting and Cardinality | X | ||||||||\n| Operations and Algebraic Thinking | X | X | X | X | X | X | |||\n| Number and Operations in Base 10 | X | X | X | X | X | X | |||\n| Measurement and Data | X | X | X | X | X | X | |||\n| Geometry | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\n| Number and Operations—Fractions | X | X | X | ||||||\n| Ratios and Proportional Relationships | X | X | |||||||\n| The Number System | X | X | X | ||||||\n| Expressions and Equations | X | X | X | ||||||\n| Statistics and Probability | X | X | X | ||||||\n| Functions | X |\nIn addition to detailed standards (of which there are 21 to 28 for each grade from kindergarten to eighth grade), the standards present an overview of \"critical areas\" for each grade.\nThere are six conceptual categories of content to be covered at the high school level:\n- Number, and quantity;\n- Algebra;\n- Functions;\n- Modeling;\n- Geometry;\n- Statistics and probability.\nSome topics in each category are indicated only for students intending to take more advanced, optional courses such as calculus, advanced statistics, or discrete mathematics. Even if the traditional sequence is adopted, functions and modeling are to be integrated across the curriculum, not taught as separate courses. Mathematical Modeling is a Standard for Mathematical Practice (see above), and is meant to be integrated across the entire curriculum beginning in kindergarten. The modeling category does not have its own standards; instead, high school standards in other categories which are intended to be considered part of the modeling category are indicated in the standards with a star symbol.\nEach of the six high school categories includes a number of domains. For example, the \"number and quantity\" category contains four domains: the real number system; quantities; the complex number system; and vector and matrix quantities. The \"vector and matrix quantities\" domain is reserved for advanced students, as are some of the standards in \"the complex number system\".\nIn high school (Grades 9 to 12), the standards do not specify which content is to be taught at each grade level, nor does the Common Core prescribe how a particular standard should be taught. Up to Grade 8, the curriculum is integrated; students study four or five different mathematical domains every year. The standards do not dictate whether the curriculum should continue to be integrated in high school with study of several domains each year (as is done in other countries), or whether the curriculum should be separated out into separate year-long algebra and geometry courses (as has been the tradition in most U.S. states). An appendix[39] to the standards describes four possible pathways for covering high school content (two traditional and two integrated), but states are free to organize the content any way they want.\nKey shifts\n[edit]The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics shifted the way the United States teaches math in three core ways. They built on the pre-existing standards to emphasize the skills and knowledge students will not only need in college, but in their career and in life as well.[40] The key shifts are:[40]\n- Greater focus on fewer topics\n- Coherence: Linking topics and thinking across grades\n- Rigor: Pursue conceptual understanding, procedural skills and fluency, and application with equal intensity\nAs an example, here is the description of one of the key shifts, a greater focus on fewer topics:[40]\nThe Common Core calls for greater focus in mathematics. Rather than racing to cover many topics in a mile-wide, inch deep curriculum, the standards ask math teachers to significantly narrow and deepen the way time and energy are spent in the classroom. This means focusing deeply on the major work of each grade as follows:\n- In grades K-2: Concepts, skills, and problem solving related to addition and subtraction\n- In grades 3-5: Concepts, skills, and problem solving related to multiplication and division of whole numbers and fractions\n- In grade 6: Ratios and proportional relationships, and early algebraic expressions and equations\n- In grade 7: Ratios and proportional relationships, and arithmetic of rational numbers\n- In grade 8: Elementary algebra and linear functions\nThis focus will help students gain strong foundations, including a solid understanding of concepts, a high degree of procedural skill and fluency, and the ability to apply the math they know to solve problems inside and outside the classroom.\nAssessment\n[edit]The impetus for assessment was not a function of the Common Core project, but to ensure states' continued compliance with the testing mandates of No Child Left Behind which required standards-aligned assessments in math and ELA in grades 3-8 and once again in high school. Two consortiums formed to create multi-state assessments, taking two different approaches.[41] The final decision of which assessment to use was determined by individual state education agencies. Both of these consortiums proposed computer-based exams that include fewer selected and constructed response test items, unlike most states' existing No Child Left Behind tests.\n- The PARCC RttT Assessment Consortium comprises the 19 jurisdictions of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Tennessee. Their approach focuses on computer-based \"through-course assessments\" in each grade together with streamlined end-of-year tests. (PARCC refers to \"Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers\" and RttT refers to the Race to the Top.)[41]\n- The second consortium, called the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, comprised 31 states and territories (as of January 2014) focusing on creating \"adaptive online exams\". Member states include Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Michigan (which uses the M-Step), Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, U.S. Virgin Islands, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.[41][42]\nAs of October 2015, SBAC membership was reduced to 20 members: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, U.S. Virgin Islands, The Bureau of Indian Education, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming.[43]\nWhile some states are working together to create a common, universal assessment based on the Common Core State Standards, other states are choosing to work independently or through these two consortiums to develop the assessment.[44] Florida Governor Rick Scott directed his state education board to withdraw from PARCC.[45] Georgia withdrew from the consortium test in July 2013 in order to develop its own.[46] Michigan decided not to participate in Smarter Balanced testing.[47] Oklahoma tentatively withdrew from the consortium test in July 2013 due to the technical challenges of online assessment.[48] Utah withdrew from the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium in August 2012.[49]\nReception\n[edit]The Common Core State Standards have drawn both support and criticism from politicians, analysts, and commentators. Teams of academics and educators from around the United States led the development of the standards, and additional validation teams approved the final standards. The teams drew on public feedback that was solicited throughout the process and that feedback was incorporated into the standards.[50] The Common Core initiative only specifies what students should know at each grade level and describes the skills that they must acquire in order to achieve college or career readiness. Individual school districts are responsible for choosing curricula based on the standards.[50] Textbooks bearing a Common Core label are not verified by any agency and may or may not represent the intent of the Common Core Standards. Some critics believe most current textbooks are not actually aligned to the Common Core, while others disagree.[51]\nThe mathematicians Edward Frenkel and Hung-Hsi Wu wrote in 2013 that the mathematical education in the United States was in \"deep crisis\", caused by the way math was being taught in schools. Both agreed that math textbooks, which were widely adopted across the states, already create \"mediocre de facto national standards\". The texts, they said, were \"often incomprehensible and irrelevant\". The Common Core State Standards address these issues and \"level the playing field\" for students. They point out that adoption of the Common Core State Standards and how best to test students are two separate issues.[52]\nIn 2012, Tom Loveless of the Brookings Institution called into question whether the standards will have any effect, and said that they \"have done little to equalize academic achievement within states\".[53] In response to the standards, the libertarian Cato Institute claimed that \"it is not the least bit paranoid to say the federal government wants a national curriculum.\"[53] According to a study published by the Pioneer Institute, although the standards themselves are sound, their method of implementation has failed to deliver improvements in literacy, while numeracy has actually declined, due to the imposition of the mediocre curriculum sequences used in a number of mid-performing states, and the \"progressive\" teaching methods that are popular among Common Core developers.[54] South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley said her state should not \"relinquish control of education to the federal government, neither should we cede it to the consensus of other states.\"[55]\nEducational analysts from the Thomas B. Fordham Institute determined that the Common Core standards \"are clearly superior to those currently in use in 39 states in math and 37 states in English. For 33 states, the Common Core is superior in both math and reading.\"[55][56] In a follow-up study,[57] researchers found that while some states were committed to updating their standards, more resources were still needed to ensure adequate implementation of those standards, including adequate course material, capacity to deliver assessments, and accountability systems.[58]\nAccording to the National Education Association, the Common Core State Standards are supported by 76% of its teacher members.[59] Research from the Fordham Institute confirmed that many teachers support Common Core, but also found that the use of multiple methods to teach a single subject negatively impacted students' and parents' perceptions of these standards.[60]\nThe Heritage Foundation argued in 2010 that the Common Core's focus on national standards would do little to fix deeply ingrained problems and incentive structures within the education system.[61]\nMarion Brady, a teacher, and Patrick Murray, an elected member of the school governing board in Bradford, Maine, wrote that Common Core drains initiative from teachers and enforces a \"one-size-fits-all\" curriculum that ignores cultural differences among classrooms and students.[62][63] Diane Ravitch, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education and education historian, wrote in her book Reign of Error that the Common Core standards have never been field-tested and that no one knows whether they will improve education.[64] Nicholas Tampio, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Fordham University, said that the standards emphasize rote learning and uniformity over creativity.[65]\nMichigan State University's Distinguished Professor William Schmidt wrote:\nIn my view, the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) unquestionably represent a major change in the way U.S. schools teach mathematics. Rather than a fragmented system in which content is \"a mile wide and an inch deep,\" the new common standards offer the kind of mathematics instruction we see in the top-achieving nations, where students learn to master a few topics each year before moving on to more advanced mathematics. It is my opinion that [a state] will best position its students for success by remaining committed to the Common Core State Standards and focusing their efforts on the implementation of the standards and aligned assessments.[66]\nThe standards require certain critical content for all students, including: classic myths and stories from around the world, America's Founding Documents, foundational American literature, and Shakespeare.[67] In May 2013, the National Catholic Educational Association noted that the standards are a \"set of high-quality academic expectations that all students should master by the end of each grade level\" and are \"not a national curriculum\".[68]\nAdvancing one Catholic perspective, over one hundred college-level scholars signed a public letter criticizing the Common Core for diminishing the humanities in the educational curriculum: The \"Common Core adopts a bottom-line, pragmatic approach to education and the heart of its philosophy is, as far as we can see, that it is a waste of resources to 'over-educate' people,\"[69] though the Common Core set only minimum—not maximum—standards. Mark Naison, Fordham University Professor, and co-founder of the Badass Teachers Association, raised a similar objection: \"The liberal critique of Common Core is that this is a huge profit-making enterprise that costs school districts a tremendous amount of money, and pushes out the things kids love about school, like art and music\".[70]\nAs Common Core is implemented in New York, the new tests have been criticized. Some parents have said that the new assessments are too difficult and are causing too much stress, leading to an \"opt-out movement\" in which parents refuse to let their children take the tests.[71]\nFormer governor Jeb Bush has said of opponents of the standards that while \"criticisms and conspiracy theories are easy attention grabbers\", he instead wanted to hear their solutions to the problems in American education.[72] In 2014, Bobby Jindal wrote that \"It has become fashionable in the news media to believe there is a right-wing conspiracy against Common Core.\"[73]\nDiane Ravitch has also stated:\nThe financial cost of implementing Common Core has barely been mentioned in the national debates. All Common Core testing will be done online. This is a bonanza for the tech industry and other vendors. Every school district must buy new computers, new teaching materials, and new bandwidth for the testing. At a time when school budgets have been cut in most states and many thousands of teachers have been laid off, school districts across the nation will spend billions to pay for Common Core testing. Los Angeles alone committed to spend $1 billion on iPads for the tests; the money is being taken from a bond issue approved by voters for construction and repair of school facilities. Meanwhile, the district has cut teachers of the arts, class size has increased, and necessary repairs are deferred because the money will be spent on iPads. The iPads will be obsolete in a year or two, and the Pearson content loaded onto the iPads has only a three-year license.[74]\nWriter Jonathan Kozol uses the metaphor \"cognitive decapitation\" to describe the unfulfilling educational experience students are going through due to the subjects that have been excluded in their curriculum as a result of the Common Core.[75] He notes cognitive decapitation is often experienced in urban schools of color, while white children have the privilege to continue engaging in a creative curriculum that involves the arts.[75]\nIn 2016, ACT, Inc., administrators of the ACT college readiness assessment, reported that there is a disconnect between what is emphasized in the Common Core and what is deemed important for college readiness by some college instructors.[76] ACT has been a proponent of the Common Core Standards, and Chief Executive Officer Martin Roorda stated that \"ACT's findings should not be interpreted as a rebuke of the Common Core.\"[76]\nImpact\n[edit]Kentucky was the first to implement the Common Core State Standards, and local school districts began offering new math and English curricula based on the standard in August 2010. In 2013, Time magazine reported that the high school graduation rate had increased from 80 percent in 2010 to 86 percent in 2013, test scores went up 2 percentage points in the second year of using the Common Core test, and the percentage of students considered to be ready for college or a career, based on a battery of assessments, went up from 34 percent in 2010 to 54 percent in 2013.[77] According to Sarah Butrymowicz from The Atlantic,\nKentucky's experience over the past three school years suggests it will be a slow and potentially frustrating road ahead for the other states that are using the Common Core. Test scores are still dismal, and state officials have expressed concern that the pace of improvement is not fast enough. Districts have also seen varying success in changing how teachers teach, something that was supposed to change under the new standards.[78]\nThe Common Core State Standards are considered to be more rigorous than the standards they replaced in Kentucky. Kentucky's old standards received a \"D\" in an analysis by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute. School officials in Kentucky believe it will take several more years to adjust to the new standards, which received an A− in math and a B+ in English from the Fordham Institute.[78][79]\nA working paper found that Common Core had a small but significant negative effect in grade 4 reading and grade 8 mathematics based on National Assessment of Educational Progress scores.[80][81]\nImplementation may be one of the major reasons why early results have been uneven. District administration and teachers have, in many cases, lacked the appropriate professional development, instructional materials, and Common Core-aligned assessments to support effective implementation of the new standards.[82][83] As of 2023, 41 states continue to use the Common Core curriculum.[84]\nAdoption and implementation by states\n[edit]The chart below contains the adoption status of the Common Core State Standards as of March 21, 2019.[85] Among the territories of the United States (not listed in the chart below), the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the American Samoa Islands have adopted the standards while Puerto Rico has not adopted the standards.\n[86] As of May 12, 2015, five states have repealed Common Core.[85] Nine additional member states have legislation in some stage of the process that would repeal Common Core participation.[86]\n| State | Adoption stance | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Alabama | Repealed | State school board voted to drop the program.[87] |\n| Alaska | Non-member | |\n| Arizona | Repealed | The Arizona State Board of Education voted to reject Common Core on October 26, 2015.

In short order, almost every state agreed to adopt them, even states with clearly superior standards like Massachusetts and Indiana, despite the fact that these new standards had never been field-tested anywhere. No one can say with certainty whether the Common Core standards will improve education, whether they will reduce or increase achievement gaps among different groups, or how much it will cost to implement them. Some scholars believe they will make no difference, and some critics say they will cost billions to implement; others say they will lead to more testing.\n- ^ Tampio, Nicholas (May 7, 2012). \"Do We Need a Common Core\".

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

Ron Johnson says in visit\nTouting the need for more jobs, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Silicon Graphics International serves as an example of how businesses around the nation can help turn around a sluggish economy.\nDuring a 20-minute tour of the Fremont, Calif.-based company's Chippewa Falls plant, Johnson on Monday praised SGI for being \"a growing company\" and a \"positive sign\" of an economic turnaround. SGI provides products for high-performance computers.\nWhile figures show the national unemployment rate has dipped to 8.5 percent, Johnson cautioned that people shouldn't focus too much on one-month statistics. He noted that 170,000 people have dropped out of the workforce, meaning they are no longer actively seeking employment.\n\"We're a long way from being out of the woods,\" Johnson said of high unemployment rates. \"We've had 30 months of President Obama's recovery. His recovery hasn't come close to being robust.\"\nJohnson, a freshman Republican, focused his discussion with the media on the need for job growth and curbing government spending. He praised the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, for passing jobs bills but said those measures have been derailed in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate.\nReducing the size of the federal budget must be addressed to help boost the economy, Johnson said.\n\"The problem is we are actually bankrupting this nation,\" Johnson said. \"We simply cannot continue to run $1.3 trillion deficits.\"\nKristen Dexter, a former state assemblywoman and current chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Eau Claire, defended Obama's economic recovery process.\n\"The job recovery has been painfully slow for some people, but I think Obama is on the right track,\" Dexter said. \"If we can fault Obama for one thing, it's that he didn't let America know how close we were to full and complete economic meltdown when he took office.\"\nDexter said Obama has made bold moves, such as extending credit to General Motors. The car manufacturer is now on solid footing, has repaid its debts, and the company is one of the reasons the job market is recovering, she said.\nWhile Congress recently raised the debt ceiling, Johnson fears the new ceiling will be reached in only two years. He also is fearful of what would happen to the U.S. economy if other countries stopped buying U.S. debt and how domestic interest rates could skyrocket.\nJohnson wouldn't throw his support behind any of the Republican presidential nominees seeking to unseat President Obama but said he would support all of them over the president.\nDick Harkness, vice president of operations at the SGI Chippewa Falls facility, said Johnson's office contacted the company about a tour.\n\"The senator certainly heard about our growth over the last 18 to 24 months and he wanted to see it,\" Harkness said, noting SGI is busy preparing to ship the Altix Ice X computer line.\nSGI currently has 400 employees at the Chippewa Falls plant, including 225 workers in manufacturing.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Remarks by President Biden on Micron’s Plan to Invest in Chips Manufacturing\nOnondaga Community College\nSyracuse, New York\n4:23 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. Hello, Syracuse! (Applause.) If you have a seat, take it. If you don’t, I’d probably leave. (Laughter.)\nShawni, thank you for that introduction and for representing your sisters and brothers of the IBEW.\nOne of the reasons I’m standing here is because of the IBEW, not a joke. They endorsed me early on and — along with, quite frankly, every other union in America — and we came along.\nI made a promise and I’m keeping it: I’d be the most pro-union President in American history, and I’m going to make sure that happens. (Applause.) Simple reason for that. You know, the middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class.\nWe used to say in the Senate, “Excuse the point of personal privilege.” I’d like to introduce some of my family and friends. And I don’t know where they are right now, but my — you know, I — I married a beautiful woman from Skaneateles Lake, who was at Syracuse. I met her on Spring Break and fell head over heels in love with her and gave up a starting job on the football team at Delaware to come up every weekend because I couldn’t stay away from her. (Laughter.)\nAnd her — her brother, Michael, is here. Where — where’s the family? There they are, back there. (Applause.) The Hunter family — the Hunter family is here. Marren and Greg; and the children, Gillian and Gregory; and Nancy Hunter and her daughter Jess; my brother-in-law, Johnny’s wife and daughter; and — as well as one of Beau’s best buddies, Andy Groat — an old friend who’s here.\nExcuse this — again, as we used to say in the Senate — “a point of personal privilege.” (Laughter.) But it’s like coming home, man — coming home. (Applause.) Molly, and her brother Jimmy Crehan.\nAnd the president of Syracuse University and the dean of the law school, who — probably I wouldn’t get in these days, although I went there on a scholarship. (Laughter.)\nAnd Mayor Walsh — Ben, thank you.\nCounty Executive McMahon. It’s good — you know, it’s good to be in a place that means so — so much to me and that means so much to our country with the project we’re here to celebrate today.\nGovernor Hochul, thank you for the passport into the state. Appreciate it very, very much. (Applause.) You’ve been a great partner to me and a great leader for this state.\nYou saw an opportunity to attract more semiconductor supply chain businesses, and you — you signed a law to make New York even more welcoming.\nWe were down in Poughkeepsie not long ago. A little outfit called IBM is spending $20 billion investing in — in incredible jobs — attracting companies and creating jobs.\nA century ago, this region was the heartland of manufacturing. And when I was up here as a law student, you had Kodak, Corning, General Electric.\nThe governor has always believed it could be that way again. She thought that would be the case, and the region is poised to lead the world in advanced manufacturing — not a joke — poised to lead the world. (Applause.)\nAnd I also want to thank my buddy, Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader. This guy gets things done. (Applause.)\nAnd a close-to-hometown girl, a senator from Upstate New York, Kirsten Gillibrand. She gets things done. (Applause.)\nI learned a long time ago: When Kirsten calls and asks something, just get — just say yes. (Laughter.) Just do it right away, because you’re going to do that anyway. (Laughter.) So, good being with you, kid.\nAnd, look, it’s a hell of a delegation. I think it’s one of the best delegations in the country. And Chuck is a great Majority Leader. (Applause.) Getting big things done. We wouldn’t be here today — it’s not hyperbole — we would be here today without him. And Kirsten’s, as I said — hometown here in Upstate New York. She’s a fighter for the families in this area. And you’ll be hearing from all these folks in a minute.\nBut Congressman John Katko — where’s John? Johnny? (Applause.) Stand up. John is a Republican, and I like him a lot. (Laughter.) I like him a lot.\nJohn, when I — I’ve been in the Congress for a long time. And we used to have — this is how we used to be. We used to work together like you’ve worked together with me and with the delegation. Thank you very much. I’m, quite frankly, a little sorry you’re leaving. And thanks for what you’ve done. (Applause.) And thanks for the passport into your district. I appreciate it.\nAnd thanks for reaching across the aisle to support the CHIPS and Science Act, which this guy wrote, right here. We’ll talk about that in a minute. (Applause.)\nYou know, and we also have one of the leading members of the United States Congress, Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. He came all the way from California just to see Chuck. (Applause.) Where — where is he? There he is. Good to see you, Adam.\nAdam and I talk together a lot. We can’t share any secrets with the rest of you, but you know, we can — we can talk. He’s the only guy I can talk to. (Laughter.) I’m only kidding.\nFolks, we’re here to celebrate one of the most significant investments in American history. Again, not hyperbole: one of the most significant investments in American history.\nAnd it’s going to ensure that the future is Made in America. (Applause.) It’s one of the bright spots around the country that should give us a sense of optimism and hope about who we are as a nation.\nAnd it’s part of a broader story about an economy we’re building — one that works for everyone — that positions America — put — America to win — a position to win the economic competition of the 21st century. And, again, that’s not an exaggeration. It’s literally an accurate statement.\nWe’re joined today by the CEO of Micron to celebrate their commitment to invest $100 billion over the next 20 years — (applause) — here in America to build American factories and make semiconductors — those small, little computer chips that power everything in our everyday lives from our smartphones, to our automobiles, to washing machines, hospital equipment, you name it. It’s the largest American investment of its kind ever, ever, ever in our history. Thank you very much, Boss. (Applause.)\nThey’re going to build factories the size of — this is not hyperbole — the size of 40 football fields. Big enough to fit the Carrier Dome four times inside it and still have space left over. And we’re going to — this is amazing what’s — what’s going to happen here. You guys have no idea yet. It’s going to run — (laughter) — and it’s going to run entirely on renewable energy.\nNine thousand jobs — (applause) — from PhDs and engineers, HVAC technicians, machine operators with an average salary of $100,000 a year and tens of thousands more jobs across the supply train [chain].\nTwenty unions working together to fill jobs for technicians, construction workers, electricians, operating engineers.\nAnd, by the way, it’s the largest investment in American history that is also governed by a project labor agreement. (Applause.) That’s a fancy way of saying “union.” Union. Not labor, union. (Applause.)\nThey ensure that the major projects are handled by well-trained, well-prepared contractors, sub-contractors, and highly skilled workers. These agreements make the construction a top-notch project because they’re the best folks to do it. Their projects are on time, on task, and on budget.\nBack in February, I signed an executive order to make sure large federal construction projects use project labor agreements, and it means that Micron is using one here as well.\nMicron is also playing — paying a prevailing wage for funding apprenticeship programs so folks can get trained at places like this community college for one of the thousands of good-paying jobs in this new site. And it really matters. It matters a lot.\nAmerica invested in these chips. The federal in- — the federal investment helped reduce their cost, creating a market and an entire industry that’s American led.\nYou know, that’s how it all started. Over — as a result, over 30 years ago, America had more than 30 percent of the global chip production. Thirty percent.\nThen something happened, American manufacturing — the backbone of our economy — got hollowed out. Companies moved jobs overseas from the industrial Midwest as well as from the Northeast and manufacturing towns like here in central New York and upstate New York.\nAnd as a result, today we’re down to producing only around 10 percent of the world’s chips. We invented them, but only we’re — we’re producing only 10 percent despite leading the world in research and design of new chip — new chip technology as well. It’s here in the United States.\nBut because of the new law I signed and Chuck designed and delivered, we’re turning things way around — around in a very big way.\nWhen a — with Micron’s $100 billion investment alone, we’re going to increase America’s share of global memory chips and production by 500 percent. (Applause.)\nThe company Intel in Ohio and other companies, including foreign companies that are investing billions of dollars — billions of dollars across America to make these chips here. And it matters to you all. No matter where you live, it matters a great deal.\nMaking these chips in America is going to help lower the costs for families looking to buy a car, to replace your washing machine, get a new cell phone. It also helps companies outcompete the rest of the world.\nAnd I’ve got — I heard from Xi Jinping that he’s a little concerned about that. (Laughter.) No, I — I’m not joking. It’s not – as I told him, it’s not about conflict, it’s about competition. And we’re back in the game. We’re competing again in a big way. (Applause.)\nThink about it this way: IBM needs these chips to build the fastest quantum computers ever built in the world in Poughkeepsie, New York.\nInstead of relying on chips made overseas that could be delayed because of a pandemic or some other global supply chain issue, they can get their chips in a few hours — in a few hours. It’s a gamechanger.\nYou know, where is it written — where is it written that the United States of America can’t be the manufacturing capital of the world? Think about this. (Applause.) No, I — I mean it sincerely. Where in the hell is it written that says we cannot be — as we’ve been hearing for the last 25 years — the manufacturing capital of the world?\nThis country lost over 180,000 manufacturing jobs under the last guy that had this job. We’ve created 700,000 manufacturing jobs on my watch, adding manufacturing jobs at a faster rate than in 40 years. (Applause.)\nThe previous President made a string of broken promises in places like Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, where promised investments and jobs in manufacturing never materialized but layoffs and shuttered factories did materialize. On my watch, we’ve kept our commitments. On my watch, “Made in America” is just a — it isn’t just a slogan, it’s a reality. Made in America. (Applause.)\nToday’s announcement is the latest example of my economic plan at work.\nI’ve said from the beginning that my objective is to build an economy from the bottom — bottom up and the middle out.\nAn economy that rewards work, not just wealth.\nAn economy that works for everyone so the poor have a ladder up, the middle class can do better. And when that happens, the wealthy do very well. They don’t get hurt at all. They do very well.\nIt’s a fundamental shift, and it’s working compared to what the very conservative Republicans are offering these days.\nLet’s just take a look at the facts. When I took office, the economy was in ruins. My predecessor was the first President since Hebert Hoover — not a joke — to lose jobs in the entirety of his administration. The first. Unemployment, when I was sworn in, was at 6.4 percent.\nHundreds of thousands of small businesses closed. The irony is that, during the pandemic, the record number of Americans became, at the same time we lost all of these small companies, the — a record number of Americans became billionaires in the middle of this crisis while more than 9 million people were still out of work from the pandemic when I took office.\nToday, with the help of the people behind me, we’re in a much better place. Ten million jobs created since we took office — a record for any administration in American history. (Applause.)\nUnemployment is at 3.5 percent — the lowest it’s been in 50 years. (Applause.) 5.4 million Americans applied to start new businesses — the highest level ever in American history. And because of the actions we’ve taken, gas prices are declining. We’re down $1.25 since the peak this summer, and they’ve been falling for the last three weeks at well — as well. That’s adding up to real savings for families.\nToday, the most common price of gas in America is $3.39 — down from over $5 when I took office. (Applause.)\nWe need to keep making that progress by having energy companies bring down the cost of a gallon of gas that reflects the cost they’re paying for a barrel of oil. There used to be a direct correlation: A barrel of oil goes down, the price at the pump goes down at the same time.\nIf we’re taking average profits they’ve been making over the last 20 years instead of the historic profits they’re making today, the price of gas would be down an additional 40 percent — 40 cents today to $3 a gallon.\nAnd by the way, last quarter, the five largest oil companies made — in the last quarter — $70 billion in profit in 90 days.\nAnd Shell announced just this morning that it made $9.5 billion in profits in the third quarter: $9.5 billion. That’s more than twice of what they made in third quarter of last year. And they raised their dividends as well, so the profits are going back to their shareholders instead of going to the pump and lowering the prices.\nBecause if they charge the same amount as they were — as they’re acting as they did a year and two years ago when the price of gas goes down, the price of oil — I mean, the price of oil goes down, the price of gas goes down.\nAnd even though my Republican friends in Congress seem to be hoping for a recession — many of them — present company excluded — (laughter) — today, the GDP results came out and the economy in fact is growing.\nIn fact, the economy grew at 2.6 percent rate last quarter. And although it may not feel like it for everyone, people’s incomes went up last quarter more than inflation went up.\nAnd enough growth — (applause) — so economic growth is up; the price of inflation is down; real incomes are on — are up; and the price of gas is down.\nFolks continue to spend, but now at a more stable pace than during our rapid recovery last year.\nBusinesses continue to invest in America.\nExports are up, which means we’re making things here in America and shipping the products overseas instead of shipping jobs overseas and sending them back here. (Applause.)\nThe supply chains are running more smoothly, helping companies build up inventories.\nHere’s another thing. My predecessor promised — and you heard it for four years — “Infrastructure Week” seemingly every week for four years, but it never got it done. It became a punchline when he’d talk about Infrastructure Week.\nWell, on my watch, we turned “Infrastructure Week” into the “Decade of Infrastructure” and a headline — (applause) — a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s roads, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, water systems, high-speed Internet.\nAnd the American people are seeing the benefits of this economy that works for them.\nFamilies have more net worth today than they did before the pandemic. Fewer families are behind on their mortgages, their credit card bills than they were before the pandemic.\nMore Americans’ health insurance — more Americans have health insurance than before the pandemic.\nAnd we’re doing everything we can to give folks just a bit — as my dad would say, just a little bit of breathing room.\nWe’re giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices. (Applause.) Folks, we’ve been trying this for as long as I was in the Congress.\nWe pay the highest price for prescription drugs of anywhere in the world. And I’m talking the exact same prescription made by the exact same drug company sold in the United States and sold in France — you can buy it probably 30 percent cheaper in France or Canada or around the world.\nWhere is it written that that’s okay? Where does it say that’s okay to do?\nWe’re capping seniors’ out-of-pocket prescriptions starting next year — prescription drugs — and it’s the law now — will not have to pay, if they’re on Medicare, more than $2,000 a year for their prescriptions — (applause) — no matter how much they cost, even if their drug costs are $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year, like some cancer drugs do cost.\nAnd now, if Big Pharma tries to raise drug prices faster than inflation, they’re going to have to write a check to Medicare to cover the difference, because there’s no rationale for it, unless they can prove they engaged in additional research to improve the product. If it’s the same exact product, they cannot raise the price beyond the cost of inflation for that particular drug. (Applause.)\nAnd by the way, put this in perspective: Last year, the price of 1,200 specific prescription drugs went up faster than inflation. We’re going to put a stop to that.\nFrom now on, if drug companies raise the price faster than inflation, they’re going to have to rebate the money back to Medicare.\nWe’re also capping the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare at $35 [a month] per prescription instead of the average $400 a month — (applause) — like some are paying now.\nWe passed tax credits to help families buy energy-efficient appliances, put solar panels on their homes, help them buy an electric vehicle, weatherize their home — things that are going to save, it’s estimated by the utility companies, an average of $500 a year for the families — and much more if they were to purchase a vehicle.\nYesterday, we announced steps my administration is taking to get rid of unfair hidden fees, known as “junk fees,” that are — that are proliferating, like surprise banking overdraft fees — an average of $35 for every overdraft; or credit card late fees — an average of $50; or if you get on a plane and you want your two-year-old child to sit next to you, you’re going to find out you paid a hell of a lot more for your ticket when you land — before you land if you find yourself in a position —\nAnd it goes on and on and on, all these hidden fees. Well, guess what? These can add up and make — taking the real money out of the pockets of ordinary Americans.\nThat’s on top of actions we took earlier this month to lower the cost of hearing aids, to make them available over the counter at places like Walgreens and Walmart.\nThis is going to save, on average, $3,000 for a pair of hearing aids for millions of Americans with hearing loss. Three thousand dollars. (Applause.)\nI took action to ease the burden of student debt for millions of working- and middle-class families — the average sa- — the average income $70,000 a family — recovering from the pandemic.\nMy friends on the right, Republic- — they crit- — they criticized the move. But I’m never going to apologize for helping working- and middle-class families as they recover from the pandemic — (applause) — especially not to those same folks who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut before I got in office to give away — that mainly benefitted wealthy Americans and the biggest corporations. Not a penny of it paid for.\nAnd we’re doing all this while reducing the deficit at the same time. I don’t want to hear about “big-spending Democrats” creating the deficit.\nLet me give you the facts: The very deficit reduction the Republicans voted against when they opposed the Inflation Reduction Act, this year — this year the deficit, under our leadership, is falling by $1.4 trillion. (Applause.) Let me say it again: This year alone, the deficit is down $1.4 trillion.\nAnd my first year in office, the deficit fell — one year — one year by $350 billion.\nLadies and gentlemen, the largest ever one-year cut in American history on the deficit — cut the deficit in half. As I said, this follows a historic drop of $350 billion last year.\nAnd we’re going to reduce the deficit by another $250 billion over the next — the next decade. Why? A big part of that is because corporations are finally going to have to pay something: a 15 percent minimum tax.\nYou know, in 2000 — (applause) — in the year 2000, 55 corporations made $40 billion. “God love them,” as my mother would say. But they paid zero in federal tax. Zero in federal tax.\nSo, guess what? The Inflation Reduction Act — we made sure they have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. That’s less than you guys pay as union members in your tax — that’s less than school teachers, firefighters, cops pay. But that 15 percent increase in the — a minimum tax is going to make sure we’re in good shape for a long time here.\nThat’s all in stark contrast to Kevin McCarthy, the Republican Leader of the House of Representatives, and his fellow MAGA Republicans, who say their number-one priority is to do the following — and they’ve said it publicly.\nBy the way, if I had asked you — and we’re just walking down the streets — and said, “Can you tell what the Republican platform is — what they’re for?” I’m — I’m not joking. I’m being deadly earnest. Like I said, I’ve been around a long time in public life. Republicans used to always have platforms to say, “This is what we’re for.”\nWell, they can’t tell you what they’re for, but they’ll make sure — they’ll tell you what they’re against. They’re going to give the power we just gave to Medicare to lower drug prices back to Big Pharma to raise prices instead.\nThe cap on — the $2,000 cap on prescription drugs for seniors, gone if they — Kevin has his way — McCarthy.\nThe $35-a-month cap on insulin for diabetes for seniors — gone.\nSavings on healthcare premiums — the $800 a year for literally millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act — gone.\nAnd, of course, they’re still determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act overall, which would mean that tens of millions of American with pre-existing conditions who can’t otherwise get insurance will lose the — even that insurance because they have a pre-existing condition.\nThose protections are gone as well if the Republicans get their way — if Kevin gets his way and the Republican se- –Congress:\nTax credits to lower energy bills — gone.\nThe corporate minimum tax — gone.\nUnder the Republican plan, some big corporations are going to go back to paying zero again.\nThat’s the plan. I would argue it’s reckless and irresponsible, and it will make inflation worse if they succeed.\nAnd then they’re coming after Social Security. Now it sounds like, you know, “What’s — there’s Biden. That’s a typical Democrat saying Republicans are after Social Security.” This is the one thing they’ve said out loud. (Laughter.) They’ve written it down on pieces of paper.\nSenator Rick Scott, the Republican from Florida who’s in charge of getting Republicans elected to the Senate, has a plan that’s laid out, and you can look it up. You can — as my — they used to say, “You can Google it.”\nThe plan that Congress will give — give Congress a chance to cut Social Security and Medicare every five years. Every five years, it’s going to be up on the ballot. It either gets voted on or it gets lost — every five years. It’s no longer — there’s no such thing as a permanent plan. Every five years. You’ve been paying your Social Security since you were 16 years old, in your first paycheck.\nSenator Ron Johnson, the senator from Wisconsin, he thinks that’s taking too long. He wants it done every year. Every year, Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block. Every single year. And now they put forward a real ticking timebomb for the country, and you’re going to hear a lot more about it.\nRepublican leadership in the Congress has said — they’ve made it clear that if they don’t get their way — if I don’t vote to shut down — excuse me, if I don’t vote to reduce Social Security and Medicare — if I don’t support that, they’re going to shut down the government, refuse to pay America’s bills for the first time in American history to put America in default.\nAgain, read this. That’s what they’re saying. Unless we yield to their demands to cut Social Security and Medicare, they’re determined to cut Social Security and Medicare, and they’re willing to take down the economy over it.\nThere is nothing, nothing that will create more chaos or do more damage to the American economy than that happening, if it were to happen.\nLet me close with this: It’s been a rough few years for a lot of people I grew up with — hardworking Americans. For a lot of families, things are still tough. But there’s some bright spots out there where America is reasserting itself.\nI’ve asked CEOs, including Micron and CEOs in many other countries, the following question — when I spoke to the Business Roundtable, spoke to the Chamber of Commerce — National Chamber of Commerce: When the United States government decides to invest considerable resources in a new industry that we need to build up for our national security and economic wellbeing, does that encourage or discourage companies from getting in the game?\nThe overwhelming answer is it encourages them to get in the game. Federal investment attracts private sector investment, particularly in those things we need badly.\nOur national security depends — depends on us having access to the most modern computer chips in the world. It depends on it. One of the things I’ve been able to do, and I make no bones about it, because of — with Russia’s activities, we have curtailed their ability to access some of this stuff. And guess what? They’re not able to rebuild those devastating weapon systems to take out those civilians in Ukraine as well. Not a joke. It makes a big difference. These things matter. They matter a great deal.\nAnd it creates jobs, and it creates industries. It demonstrates we’re all in this together. And that’s what today is all about. I’ve never — and I mean it sincerely — I’ve never been more optimistic in my life about America’s future. I mean it sincerely. (Applause.)\nNot because I’m President, but because we have entrepreneurs and people who know what they’re doing to lead us through through an — in a completely different era in terms of the kinds of technologies we need, like this man right here.\nBecause I look out at that the younger generation. It’s the best-educated generation, the least prejudiced, the most engaged, and the most least self-serving generation in American history.\nLook, I hope you feel — (applause) — I hope you feel what I feel standing here today: pride — pride in what we can do when we do it together to build a better America, providing our — proving that — to everyone — proving to the world that our best days are ahead of us.\nI know every major world leader because of the nature of my job. And before that, when I was Vice President, that was my job. And before that, I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And guess what? There’s not a single nation in the world — a major nation — that wouldn’t trade places with the President of the United States in a heartbeat. Not a si- — no, not a joke. Think about it. Not a single, solitary one. Not a single one.\nAnd I talk to these folks all the time and meet with them all the time, and they want to know are we going to be okay. Because if we’re doing well, they think they got a shot to do well too. And I — that’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact. But we just have to keep it going. And I know we can.\nWe just have to remember, for God’s sake, who we are. We are the United States of America. (Applause.) There is nothing — there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. And we’re the only nation in the world that has come out of every crisis better than when we went into the crisis. And, folks, we’re going to do it again.\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops.\nAnd now I want to invite my good friend, the great partner Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, to the podium — author of the CHIPS and Science Act and one of the major reasons we’re standing here.\nChuck, the podium is yours.

Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services cleared the Senate Finance Committee with senators voting along party lines. It now heads to the full Senate for a final vote. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin sits on that committee and discussed the hearings with Geoff Bennett. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: Well, as we have reported, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services cleared the Senate Finance Committee today, senators voting along party lines. It now heads to the full Senate for a final vote.Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin sits on that committee, and I spoke with him earlier today.Thanks for being with us. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI): Thanks for having me on. Geoff Bennett: So the committee vote to advance RFK Jr.'s nomination followed from what I understand was a fairly intense pressure campaign from Trump administration officials and Mr. Kennedy himself.Your colleague Senator Bill Cassidy, who happens to be a physician, said that his yes-vote came with conditions to ensure the public's continued access to vaccines. Take a listen. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA): To this end, Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship if he is confirmed. We will meet or speak multiple times a month.This collaboration will allow us to work well together and therefore to be more effective. Geoff Bennett: So, that raises the question, if securing confirmation demands such unprecedented concessions, is RFK Jr. truly the right choice to begin with? Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, first of all, I don't think those are particularly major concessions on the part of RFK Jr.He wants to follow the science. He is not anti-vax. I'm certainly not anti-vax. We want to make sure that the vaccines that are on the childhood schedule are as safe as possible, recognizing that nothing is 100 percent safe, and that they're effective.Certainly, we want to prevent childhood disease to the extent we can, but we also have to have an open mind, I mean, that there are — the reality is, there are vaccine injuries. They acknowledge that fact when they passed the Childhood Vaccine Safety Act back in 1986. Injury, vaccine injuries are just unavoidable. It happens.We need to take care of those individuals, which is why we set up a compensation fund. It's completely indisputable that the COVID injection caused injuries. So, again, all these things have to be explored. People have to have an open mind on it, but nobody wants to take anybody's vaccine away because we — vaccines are miracles if they can prevent disease without causing too much undue harm. Geoff Bennett: What actual ability would the Senate have to oversee or rein in HHS if that's what's needed beyond what has been done in the past? Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, again, all I'm looking for — all I have ever looked for is total transparency. Follow the science.And, unfortunately, I believe science has been corrupted. You have had capture of our federal agencies by corporate interests, whether it's big pharma or big food processing or big agriculture. I think that's also pretty much indisputable.So what we need is, we need total transparency. We need to uncorrupt science. When you pay for science, you get the result you want. And that's not in the public's best interest. So, for my standpoint, it starts with making sure that science has integrity, that peer review actually means something, that we're also willing to take a look at observational studies and other forms of evidence, but that we have an open mind toward these things.That's all I'm looking for. That's all I think that RFK Jr. is looking for. Geoff Bennett: Big picture, how do you and other Republican lawmakers view your role in this moment as you lead what is a co-equal branch of government?And I ask the question because, as we sit here and speak, Elon Musk is unilaterally dismantling the foreign aid agency USAID. He now has access to sensitive government payment systems, with no public concern, no public constraint from Republicans in Congress, whom the American people actually elected to run this government. Why not? Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, first of all, we have people in these agencies that believe they're completely unaccountable to the American public. They have stiff-armed me as I have written multiple requests for information for multiple agencies.Secretary of State Rubio basically made the same claim against USAID. So you already have bureaucrats run amuck who don't believe they're accountable. What President Trump is doing is, he's fulfilling a promise. He's trying to get the bottom of this, of the waste, fraud and abuse of the federal government that is right now completely out of control.So I appreciate Elon Musk's endeavors. He's a genius in terms of squeezing out all his money inefficiencies from the businesses he's run. And he's like the perfect guy putting types of people who have access to computer models and A.I. to quickly diagnose what inefficiencies are occurring in these agencies.And let's face it. USAID is just the tip of the iceberg.(Crosstalk) Sen. Ron Johnson: It's just the tip of the iceberg. Geoff Bennett: But if there's a debate about USAID's mission or funding, why not have that debate? There is a process for that, a legal process to have that debate. Sen. Ron Johnson: We will have that debate. First, we need the information. And you can't get the information when you have these bureaucrats who are protecting the information and not turning it over to Congress or over to the elected president.It's undeniable that you had bureaucrats in the first Trump term that undermined and sabotaged his administration. He's trying not to let that happen again. I applaud his swift and decisive actions. Geoff Bennett: Well, here's a thought experiment that occurs to me. If, during the Biden administration, George Soros had access to sensitive government payment systems and unilaterally dismantled an independent government agency, Republicans in Congress would be apoplectic.The indignation would be palpable. Why is that not happening now? Is it because Donald Trump is president? Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, we weren't particularly happy when President Biden weaponized the Department of Justice, the FBI, engaged in lawfare, persecuted his political opponents.So, again, that's the problem, is big government is unaccountable. It's infiltrated by radical leftists who have weaponized government against conservatives. So, again, we're trying to get control of the situation. President Trump experienced, again, the sabotage undermining his administration in the first term.He's trying to prevent that from happening in the second term. I completely understand why he's trying to do these things. Geoff Bennett: In the time that remains, I want to ask you about tariffs, because you have said that you share the market concerns about President Trump's tariff plan. What are your concerns? Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, first of all, there's multiple uses for tariffs. And I think President Trump has demonstrated a unique ability to use tariffs to gain concessions from, for example, Mexico and Canada to try and help us secure the border, try and stop the flow of fentanyl.I think Peter Navarro said this isn't a trade war. This is a war on drugs. I don't disagree with that. And what I would be concerned about is a generalized tariff long term, creating long-term dislocation in terms of supply chains.I want free and fair trade. Another use for tariffs is to discipline people who are not engaging in fair trade. So this is a complex issue. I have concerns, but I also give President Trump the benefit of the doubt in terms of using tariffs to negotiate a better position for U.S., for the U.S. and for its citizens. Geoff Bennett: Is that how you think he's using them, for leverage and as a negotiating tactic? I ask the question because Canada is Wisconsin's single biggest trading partner. Wisconsin has a lot on the line here. Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, I think it's obvious right now. I mean, he used it effectively in his first term to make sure that Mexico cooperated with remain-in-Mexico and we were able to secure the border.We have now got a pledge for both Canada and Mexico to move personnel into place to help us secure the border and stop the flow of drugs. So I think the proof is in the pudding. Seems to be working pretty well right now. Geoff Bennett: Senator Ron Johnson, always good to see you. Thanks for coming on the program. Appreciate it. Sen. Ron Johnson: Have a great day.

In a vote that never should have had to be taken, every single Democrat voted to force Sharia law on the people of Florida. By doing so, they placed women and children in very real danger. The vote was 24 votes for America and 14 votes for al-Qaida and the Taliban cast by loathsome Democrats.\"The article said that elements of Sharia law include women being barred from voting, forced marriages for young girls, stoning to death of adulterous women and a requirement that women wear burqas -- the full-body clothing required of women in some very traditional Islamic societies -- when in public.While we were distracted by the close of the legislative session and a hotly contested governor's race, we somehow missed Democrats voting in favor of burqas and stoning. But readers have made clear to us that they want to know: Did Florida Democrats vote to impose Sharia law on women?What the bill was aboutIt's important to note that claims that \"Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women\" are wrong on many levels -- the first of which is that Democratic lawmakers didn't vote affirmatively for doing any of those things. They voted against a bill that would have barred the use of foreign laws in some contexts, something far more limited.Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation. At root of the Florida issue is a dispute between a Tampa Islamic center and some of its ousted trustees. In making a ruling on the case in March 2011, a circuit court judge cited Islamic law, sparking outcry from conservatives. That month, two Republican state lawmakers, Sen. Alan Hays and Rep. Larry Metz, announced they would push for a bill to ban foreign law in Florida courts.After several failed efforts, the bill that passed this year -- Senate Bill 386, \"Application of Foreign Law in Courts\" -- was watered down compared to previous versions.The bill doesn't specifically mention Sharia law, and it doesn't outright ban the use of Sharia law, said Eduardo Palmer, a Coral Gables lawyer who serves on the legislative committee of the Florida Bar's international law section. But much of the discussion centered on Sharia law.The bill only applies to family-law cases, including divorce, child support and child custody. It doesn't apply to other areas of law, such as corporate matters.The bill states \"A court may not enforce: (a) A choice of law provision in a contract selecting the law of a foreign country which contravenes the strong public policy of this state or that is unjust or unreasonable. ... The purpose of this section is to codify existing case law, and that intent should guide the interpretation of this section.\"The law allows a judge to agree to apply foreign law as long as it doesn't contradict public policy in the U.S. For example, if a couple signed a prenuptial agreement in Argentina and later gets a divorce in Florida, a Miami judge could decide to apply Argentina's law in the divorce case here, Palmer said. But if a foreign law violated our public policy in the United States about child labor rules, for example, then a judge could reject it.\"That is the universal standard that most civilized countries adhere to,\" Palmer said.In reality, the bill doesn't change existing law, which already allowed judges such discretion.An earlier version would have been much more aggressive -- it would have raised the standards before a judge could have allowed the use of foreign law. A compromise essentially codified existing law.The Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which tracks and counters anti-Islamic attacks, and Florida's Anti-Defamation League, a group that fights anti-Semitism, both lobbied against the bill.Legislators who voted against the bill argued that it was unnecessary and was tantamount to an attack on Muslims.Rep. Jim Waldman, D-Coconut Creek, told the House \"This bill, this proposal, stems directly from a hatred of Muslims. It's caught on across the country and many other state legislatures have dealt with this, and I find it reprehensible.\"Waldman called the bill \"a solution in search of a problem.\"A Florida Senate staff analysis in April stated there were six states that currently had laws restricting foreign law in state courts: Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. (An amendment approved by Oklahoma voters that expressly banned Sharia law was ruled unconstitutional, prompting Legislatures to later go with the more generic \"foreign law.\")The Senate approved the bill 24-14, with all the votes in opposition coming from Democrats. The House approved the bill 78-40, with a majority of Democrats voting \"no.\" (House Democrats who voted \"yes\" included Daphne Campbell of Miami, Betty Reed of Tampa and Hazelle Rogers of Lauderdale Lakes.)As of May 6, Scott had not signed it into law yet and a spokesman said his office would review the bill.How common and controversial is the use of foreign law in Florida courts?International law experts told us it's not unusual for foreign law to get used in Florida courts.\"Foreign law is applied all the time, in various ways, and it is almost never controversial,\" said C. Ryan Reetz, a Miami lawyer and chair of the Florida Bar's international section.For example, parties in international contracts frequently agree to apply a specific foreign country's law to govern their agreements.\"In addition, there is an entire body of law called 'conflict of laws' or 'choice of laws' that governs when the law of a different state or foreign country will be applied to one or more issues in the case,\" Reetz said. \"As in all other states, the Florida courts have developed a series of conflict of laws rules that address this question. This body of law dates back to the founding of our country, and it has been especially well-documented over the last 100 years.\"In contracts, parties can choose to apply the law of any jurisdiction and the court will accept those laws as long as it doesn't conflict with our Constitution, said Cyra Akila Choudhury, Florida International University law professor who wrote a paper about states passing anti-Sharia laws. \"The Hillsborough case that is referred to was a contract case in which both parties chose shari'ah as the law,\" she said. \"And the court had to give it credence as the freely chosen legal rules by which the contract was to be interpreted. It was no different than if they had chosen German law, or Klingon law.\"The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida opposed the bill, although spokesman Baylor Johnson said the final version \"has relatively little impact on existing law.\"\"Just like some folks think that tinfoil hats will protect you from the imaginary threat of aliens reading your thoughts, the 'foreign law' bill won't protect against the imaginary threat of 'Sharia law' taking over Florida, because that threat isn't real,\" Johnson said.Our rulingClaims like this one recently circulated on the internet: \"Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women.\"Senate Democrats did vote against a bill that prohibits judges from applying foreign law in family-law cases if it contradicts United States public policy. In reality, though, the bill would have essentially codified existing practice. The bill didn't single out Sharia law, and the United States Constiution still applies.It's ridiculous -- beyond ridiculous, really -- to suggest that Senate Democrats forced on women such elements of Sharia law as burqa-wearing and stoning to death.

In a vote that never should have had to be taken, every single Democrat voted to force Sharia law on the people of Florida. By doing so, they placed women and children in very real danger. The vote was 24 votes for America and 14 votes for al-Qaida and the Taliban cast by loathsome Democrats.\"It's important to note right off that claims that \"Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women\" are wrong on many levels — the first of which is that Democratic lawmakers didn't vote affirmatively for doing any of those things. They voted against a bill that would have barred the use of foreign laws in some contexts, something far more limited.Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation.At root of the Florida issue is a dispute between a Tampa Islamic center and some of its ousted trustees. In making a ruling on the case in March 2011, a circuit judge cited Islamic law, sparking outcry from conservatives. That month, two Republican state lawmakers, Sen. Alan Hays and Rep. Larry Metz, announced they would push for a bill to ban foreign law in Florida courts.After several failed efforts, the bill that passed this year — SB 386, \"Application of Foreign Law in Courts\" — was watered down compared with previous versions.The bill doesn't specifically mention Sharia law, and it doesn't outright ban the use of Sharia law, said Eduardo Palmer, a Coral Gables lawyer who serves on the legislative committee of the Florida Bar's international law section. But much of the discussion centered on Sharia law.The bill only applies to family-law cases, including divorce, child support and child custody. It doesn't apply to other areas of law, such as corporate matters.The bill states \"A court may not enforce: (a) A choice of law provision in a contract selecting the law of a foreign country which contravenes the strong public policy of this state or that is unjust or unreasonable. . . . The purpose of this section is to codify existing case law, and that intent should guide the interpretation of this section.\"The legislation allows a judge to agree to apply foreign law as long as it doesn't contradict public policy in the United States. For example, if a couple signed a prenuptial agreement in Argentina and later gets a divorce in Florida, a Miami judge could decide to apply Argentina's law in the divorce case here, Palmer said. But if a foreign law violated our public policy in the United States about child labor rules, for example, then a judge could reject it.\"That is the universal standard that most civilized countries adhere to,\" Palmer said.The Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which tracks and counters anti-Islamic attacks, and Florida's Anti-Defamation League, a group that fights anti-Semitism, both lobbied against the bill.Legislators who voted against the bill argued that it was unnecessary and tantamount to an attack on Muslims.Rep. Jim Waldman, D-Coconut Creek, told the House \"This bill, this proposal, stems directly from a hatred of Muslims. It's caught on across the country and many other state legislatures have dealt with this, and I find it reprehensible.\"Waldman called the bill \"a solution in search of a problem.\"The Senate approved the bill 24-14, with all the votes in opposition coming from Democrats. The House approved the bill 78-40, with a majority of Democrats voting \"no.\"A spokesman for Gov. Rick Scott said he will review the bill. Our ruling Senate Democrats did vote against a bill that prohibits judges from applying foreign law in family-law cases if it contradicts United States public policy. In reality, though, the bill essentially codifies existing practice. The bill didn't single out Sharia law, and the U.S. Constitution still applies.It's ridiculous — beyond ridiculous, really — to suggest that Senate Democrats forced on women such elements of Sharia law as burqa-wearing and stoning to death.

Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the differences couldn't have been more clear.\nThe two Texans split sharply during the hour-long face-off over immigration, the National Football League kneeling controversy, gun rights, marijuana legalization, police-involved shootings, the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and more.\nThere was virtually no common ground, on anything. And they didn't hesitate to get in each other's faces.\nCruz hammered O'Rourke, who represents the border town area of El Paso, over his support for undocumented immigrants.\nDuring the face-off at Southern Methodist University in Dallas before a live audience, O'Rourke said he wants to provide a pathway to legalization for undocumented immigrants and attacked Cruz for pushing to deport all of them, including \"Dreamers\" brought to the United States as children. Cruz then boiled down his position on the issue to the audience in four words: “Legal good, illegal bad.\"\nThe race between Cruz and O'Rourke is regarded as surprisingly competitive for a Democrat in a red state. Texas hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate in 25 years, and it's garnering national attention. This week, the authoritative Cook Political Report rated the contest as a \"toss-up.\"\nThe candidates, answering questions from two reporters from NBC 5 and The Dallas Morning News, also clashed over the controversy involving football players kneeling during the national anthem to protest police-involved shootings of unarmed black men. President Donald Trump has repeatedly condemned the kneeling as disrespectful.\nCruz said he also found the protests to be offensive and added that he believed there are better ways for players to fight injustice. But O'Rourke likened the protests to the civil rights movement and said he supported the players.\nCruz tried to paint O’Rourke as anti-law enforcement and claimed his opponent had called police \"modern day Jim Crow,\" which O'Rourke denied.\nThe candidates also traded barbs when they were asked about the death of Botham Jean, a black Texas man shot at his home by an off-duty Dallas police officer earlier this month.\nCruz accused O'Rourke of not backing law enforcement and rushing to judgment against the officer who shot Jean, calling it a \"troubling pattern\" and charging that his opponent uses \"irresponsible and hateful rhetoric\" against police officers.\nO’Rourke shot back and blasted Cruz for \"slander.\"\n\"This is your trick in the trade, to confuse and to incite fear,\" O’Rourke said.\nThe candidates also discussed the scandal surrounding Kavanaugh, the president's Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault while the two were in high school.\nCruz said that if Ford testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee and there is something compelling in her appearance he would \"absolutely\" not vote to confirm Trump's pick.\nHowever, he slammed O’Rourke for supporting liberal \"activist\" judges who Cruz charged will not follow the Constitution, an attack the Democrat dismissed.\nO’Rourke said that even without Ford’s allegation, he could not get behind Kavanaugh because of the judge's record on issues, such as voting rights and abortion. He added that her claim of assault should be investigated by the FBI before any Senate confirmation vote takes places.\n\"Dr. Ford's allegations should be investigated by the FBI. Full stop,\" O'Rourke said.\nO'Rourke, who boasted that he has visited every county in Texas for his Senate campaign, slammed Cruz for missing days in the Senate while on the campaign trail for president in 2016.\n\"You tell me who can miss half the days at work and then be rehired for the same job going forward?\" O'Rourke said.\nOn another issue, Cruz accused O'Rourke of flirting with legalizing all drugs when the Democratic lawmaker was an El Paso City Council member. O'Rourke denied that, but said he supported legalizing marijuana in the state for medicinal purposes as an alternative to prescription painkillers.\nThe debate also became contentious when the candidates were asked about gun rights, particularly school shootings, such as the Santa Fe, Texas, high school murders in May.\nCruz suggested such shootings are a result of \"removing God from the public square\" and called for armed guards in schools as a deterrent. He charged that O'Rourke was a Hillary Clinton supporter who wanted to toss out the Second Amendment.\nO’Rourke denied he wanted to get rid of the right to own guns but rather sought to make it harder for civilians to access military-grade weapons.\n\"Thoughts and prayers are simply not going to cut it anymore, Senator Cruz,\" he said.\nDuring the debate, O'Rourke repeatedly sidestepped opportunities to attack Trump, saying he would stand up to the president on some issues and work with him on others after Cruz claimed O'Rourke wanted to impeach the president.\nToward the end, the candidates were asked to say something nice about each other. For his part, O'Rourke credited Cruz for being a family man and his public service. Cruz, in turn, offered a backhand compliment by praising O'Rourke for standing up for his beliefs—even if it was for being a socialist like Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\"True to form,\" O'Rourke said under his breath in response.\nThe debate was the first of three that have been scheduled.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Democratic gubernatorial candidate Lupe Valdez has agreed to debate her runoff opponent, Andrew White, on May 11 in Austin.\nPatrick Svitek\nPatrick Svitek was the primary political correspondent for The Texas Tribune.

The city also would not pay to test substances suspected to be marijuana - a key step in substantiating drug charges.\nBoth practices have already been informally adopted in Austin, but advocates want to solidify them at the May ballot box.\n\"The primary effect is that it would make the decriminalization that exists in Austin today actually long term and would put the force of law behind it,\" said Chris Harris, policy director at Austin Justice Coalition.\nAustin law enforcement has met the idea with varying degrees of hostility and indifference in recent years. After the Austin City Council informally asked the police department in 2020 to halt citations and arrests for misdemeanor marijuana charges, then-Chief Brian Manley said the council doesn't have the authority to tell him not to enforce state law. And officers still have latitude to decide whether to make arrests and write citations.\nRELATED: Pot cases down, confusion up after pot law change\nChief Joseph Chacon has been mum on the current proposal. A representative for the Austin Police Department did not return a request for comment Monday.\nAnd the Austin Police Association, the union that represents Austin officers, is staying out of the ballot fight - but not because it's happy with the idea.\n\"We don't support it just because we feel like you should follow state law,\" said Ken Casaday, head of the union. \"They're skirting state law. But the thing is if this makes people in Austin happy, so be it.\"\nAustin's city clerk verified Monday that the campaign collected enough signatures - at least 20,000 - to appear on the May ballot. The city council still must vote to put the measure, which also would formally ban \"no-knock\" warrants, on the ballot.\nBut the measure faces one big obstacle: Although marijuana laws in Texas have loosened somewhat in recent years, the drug remains illegal at the state level.\nPublic support for harsh marijuana laws and prosecutors' willingness to bring charges for minor offenses has waned in recent years.\nThe number of new charges for misdemeanor marijuana possession fell by 59% from 2016 to 2020, according to figures from the Texas Office of Court Administration, as prosecutors in the state's major urban areas have increasingly deprioritized marijuana prosecutions.\nMost Texas voters support decriminalizing marijuana in some form. Three-fifths of Texas voters say at least a small amount of marijuana should be legal, according to a University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll last year.\nThat support cuts across partisan lines. Nearly three-fourths of Democrats and independents think marijuana should be legal. So do 43% of Republicans, a plurality of that group.\nIt's against that backdrop that Ground Game Texas - a progressive group focused on issues of \"workers, wages and weed\" - plans to mount decriminalization campaigns in Killeen and Harker Heights. In San Marcos, another organization is gathering signatures for a similar ballot measure.\n\"This is a very popular issue, even among a lot of Republicans,\" said Mike Siegel, political director for Ground Game Texas.\nIn the past, Gov. Greg Abbott and Republican leaders have sought to punish Austin for adopting left-leaning measures like cutting the city's police spending or allowing homeless encampments in public.\nBut Abbott has signaled openness to some forms of marijuana decriminalization. In May, he signed an expansion of the state's medical marijuana program to include people with cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder. And on Monday, he said he has little appetite for severe punishment for low-level marijuana offenses.\n\"One thing that I believe in, and I believe the state Legislature believes in, and that is prison and jail is a place for dangerous criminals who may harm others,\" Abbott said Monday during a campaign stop in Edinburg. \"Small possession of marijuana is not the type of violation that we want to stockpile jails with.\"\nDespite Abbott's assertion about lawmakers' positions, bills aiming to decriminalize or legalize marijuana haven't gotten through the Legislature in recent years. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a fellow Republican who heads the state Senate, has previously said he's \"strongly opposed\" to loosening punishment for pot possession.\nMORE: What is Delta 8 THC and why is it considered 'legal weed' in Texas?\nPart of Abbott's play is not to alienate moderate voters in the November general election who believe in some degree of marijuana decriminalization, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. His Democratic opponent, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, has regularly backed marijuana legalization on the campaign trail.\n\"The governor doesn't want to be on the wrong side of public opinion on what is otherwise a popular issue towards decriminalizing and, for some, outright legalization for recreational use,\" Rottinghaus said.\nREAD: Entrepreneur creates direct-to-consumer business ahead of marijuana decriminalization efforts\nDisclosure: University of Houston has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

After spending a low-profile first year in office focusing on solidifying his base in Illinois and traveling abroad to buttress his foreign policy credentials as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama spent much of 2006 speaking to audiences around the country and mulling whether to run for president.

Relying heavily on the Internet, the Obama campaign mobilized Obama for America (OFA), a massive grassroots organization of volunteers and donors. (After he was elected, OFA was recast as Organizing for America for the purpose of rousing public support for Obama’s legislative initiatives.) With Axelrod again at the helm, the campaign developed a strategy for winning the Democratic nomination that relied on assembling the same coalition of blacks and white liberals that had enabled him to succeed in Illinois, with an additional focus on young voters. Initially, however, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton opened a strong lead in the polls, even among African American voters and leaders who admired her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and did not think Obama had much of a chance to win. Former Senator John Edwards, the Democrats’ vice presidential nominee in 2004, was also widely regarded at the start of the campaign as a stronger candidate than the inexperienced Obama.\nDrawing on his online base of supporters, Obama initially surprised political pundits by matching Clinton and besting Edwards in campaign fundraising throughout 2007. He became the co-frontrunner in the race by winning the crucial Iowa caucuses on January 3, 2008, defeating both Edwards and Clinton by an 8-percentage point margin. Clinton rebounded to win the New Hampshire primary five days later, edging out Obama by 3 points and crushing Edwards by 22 points. In the next important test, Obama opened up a narrow lead in the nomination contest by defeating Clinton handily in the South Carolina primary, 55 percent to 27 percent, on January 26. Black voters, convinced by the Iowa results that whites would vote for an African American candidate for president, gave him overwhelming support in South Carolina and in subsequent primaries. Edwards finished a distant third in the state where he was born and dropped out of the race on January 30. Other contenders for the nomination, including Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware, and Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, had already dropped out because of their poor showings in the initial round of primaries and caucuses.\nFrom February through early June, Obama and Clinton battled fiercely through the remaining primaries and caucuses. Overall, Clinton won twenty primaries to Obama’s nineteen, including victories in most of the large states, notably California, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Both candidates were bidding to become historic “firsts”—the first African American president or the first woman president.\nBut Obama had three crucial advantages that enabled him to eke out a narrow victory for the Democratic nomination. First, he was able to contrast his consistent opposition to the war in Iraq with Clinton’s vote in 2002 to authorize the war before later turning against it. Second, although there was little difference between Clinton and Obama on the issues, Obama ran on a theme of change and Clinton on a theme of experience. In a year when the economy was steadily deteriorating, change was the more appealing theme, especially among Democratic voters. Third, while fighting Clinton in the thirty-nine primaries, Obama did not overlook the seventeen states and territories that, like Iowa, choose their national convention delegates through caucuses. He strongly out-organized Clinton in those contests, winning fourteen of seventeen caucuses. The delegates Obama won in the caucuses put him over the top. Clinton withdrew from the nominating contest on June 7, 2008.\nAs hard-fought as his victory was, Obama faced only one serious crisis during the entire nomination campaign. In early March, news organizations and websites showed video recordings of some controversial sermons by Obama’s pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, including one in which Wright blamed the United States for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington and another in which he accused the federal government of “inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.” Obama largely defused the crisis by giving a speech in Philadelphia on March 18, 2008, repudiating Wright's statements and thoughtfully outlining his own views on race relations. But he faced continuing difficulties winning white working class votes against Clinton in the primaries, and some doubted that he could win their support in the general election against the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona.\nPartly to expand his appeal to working-class whites, and partly to offset his own modest foreign policy credentials, Obama named Senator Joe Biden of Delaware as his vice presidential running mate on August 22, two days before the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Biden had grown up in blue-collar Scranton, Pennsylvania, and during his thirty-six years as a senator from Delaware, had risen up the seniority ladder to become chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\nIn his acceptance speech on the last night of the convention, Obama outlined the issues of his general election campaign. Among other things, Obama promised to “cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families,” “end our dependence on oil from the Middle East,” “invest $150 billion over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy,” provide “affordable, accessible health care for every single American,” close “corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow,” “end this war in Iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan,” and allow “our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to visit the person they love in a hospital and live lives free of discrimination.”\nObama left Denver on August 29 enjoying a small lead over McCain in the polls. But on that same day, McCain stole Obama's thunder by selecting Governor Sarah T. Palin of Alaska as his running mate. Palin balanced the Republican ticket in some obvious ways: young rather than old (Palin was forty-four, McCain was seventy-two), a woman rather than a man, a governor rather than a senator, and a social conservative rather than a national security conservative. At the same time, Palin's reform record in Alaska reinforced McCain's longstanding image as a political “maverick” who bucked the Washington establishment. Her rousing acceptance speech at the convention helped to propel the Republican ticket into a small lead over Obama and Biden in early September.\nMcCain maintained his narrow advantage in the polls until mid-September, when the nation's financial sector, heavily invested in risky mortgage-backed securities, went into a sudden tailspin. In the three nationally televised debates between the presidential candidates that took place from September 26 to October 15, Obama's calm, confident, and competent demeanor impressed voters who were looking for both reassurance that all would be well and a change in the nation's direction. By eschewing federal campaign funds, Obama was also able to outspend McCain substantially on media advertising and grassroots organizing. In addition, Biden impressed most voters as a much more qualified choice for vice president than Palin, whose unfamiliarity with national and international issues was revealed in a series of television interviews. And, much to his credit, McCain refused to revive concerns about Obama's long association with Reverend Wright for fear of inflaming racial tensions.\nObama was elected handily on November 4, 2008. He defeated McCain by 53 percent to 46 percent in the national popular vote. Exit polls revealed that the two candidates broke even among voters who had participated in the 2004 election. But Obama built his majority among first-time voters who surged to the polls in 2008, many of them young or African American. In the Electoral College, Obama prevailed by a margin of 365 to 173. While carrying all of the traditionally “blue” states in the Northeast, Pacific Coast, and Great Lakes region, Obama built his majority by winning previously “red” states such as Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Colorado.\nElection night inspired gracious oratory by both candidates. “If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible,” Obama told a cheering crowd of supporters, “who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.” Conceding defeat, McCain said, “This is a historic election, and I recognize the significance it has for African Americans and the special pride that must be theirs tonight. We both realize that we have come a long way from the injustices that once stained our nation's reputation.”\nMidterm Election of 2010\nFrom the very start of Obama’s tenure as president, congressional Republicans pursued a strategy of consistent, strenuous opposition to most of his legislative initiatives. Politically, the strategy bore fruit in the 2010 midterm elections. As Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota said, “Their bumper sticker has one word: 'No.' Our bumper sticker has way too many words. And it says: 'Continued on the next bumper sticker.'”\nLooking at the stubbornly high unemployment rate Obama inherited on taking office, many voters refused to accept the president's argument that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act had kept joblessness from rising even higher. Voters who were satisfied with their health insurance continued to worry that Obama’s plan for health care reform would increase the cost and reduce the quality of medical care. The new grassroots conservative Tea Party movement fueled a surge in turnout among Republican voters in 2010 even as participation among Obama's core constituencies in 2008—young and African American voters—declined. On election day, the Republicans gained 6 seats in the Senate, reducing the Democrats' majority in that chamber from 18 (59 to 41) to 6 (53 to 47). The GOP added 63 seats in the House of Representatives, enough to gain control of the House by a 242 to 193 majority in the 112th Congress.\nThe certainty that divided government—a Republican House and a Democratic Senate and president—would prevail for the remainder of Obama's first term persuaded the president and the leaders of both parties to act on a variety of important issues during the post-2010 election “lame duck” session of Congress. With George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts set to expire on December 31, 2010, Obama put aside his opposition to continuing them for families with more than $250,000 in annual income and agreed to allow congressional Republicans to keep the cuts in place. In return, the GOP accepted President Obama's proposal to extend unemployment benefits for jobless workers for a longer period, and both parties embraced a one-year reduction in social security taxes for everyone who pays them.\nIn addition, Congress and the president agreed to abolish President Bill Clinton's “don't ask, don't tell” policy preventing openly gay and lesbian people from serving in the military. Republicans feared that federal courts were about to order immediate integration of homosexuals into the armed services. General Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, persuaded them that the military was prepared to accept the change if allowed to implement it gradually. The lame duck session also saw the Senate ratify the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia by a 71 to 26 vote.\nThe 2012 Election\nPresident Obama entered the 2012 election year with job approval ratings that were dangerously low (roughly 40 percent) and an unemployment rate that was dangerously high (more than 8 percent) for an incumbent seeking reelection. But, like Bill Clinton in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2004, Obama benefited enormously from not having to fight for his party's nomination. Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980, and George Bush in 1992 had to wage such battles, and each of them was defeated by his general election opponent in November. In contrast, Obama was able to use the first eight months of 2012 to raise money, rebuild his campaign organization, develop lines of attack on his likely Republican opponents, and launch his general election campaign from a united, enthusiastic Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Caroline, in September 2012. Following the pattern of reelection-seeking presidents since the 1950s, Obama chose Vice President Biden to run with him for a second term.\nWhile Obama was uniting his party for the fall, the Republicans were waging a fierce intraparty battle to choose their nominee. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney won the nomination, but was subjected to severe attacks by his Republican rivals. For example, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich accused Romney of having “looted” companies during his career as a business consultant and branded him a “vulture capitalist.” Governor Rick Perry of Texas said that Romney had gotten rich by “sticking it to someone else.” Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Representative Michelle Bachman of Minnesota, and businessman Herman Cain were among the other Republican contenders who battered Romney relentlessly for being insufficiently conservative. Romney won the nomination and placated conservatives by choosing the chair of the House Budget Committee, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, as his vice presidential running mate in advance of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida. But only then was he able to focus on raising money for the general election, move toward the more popular political center, and direct his campaign toward defeating Obama.\nThe Supreme Court's 2010 decision in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission opened the floodgates to corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals to spend massive amounts of money in an effort to elect either Obama or Romney, as well as in the congressional elections. By year's end, about $1 billion was spent by or on behalf of each of the two nominees for president, both of whom eschewed federal financing and the spending limits that accompanied that financing.\nIn a closely divided country, both Romney and Obama counted on winning about twenty states and fought the campaign in about ten “battleground” states. Some of them were large such as Florida and Ohio, and some of them were small such as New Hampshire and Iowa, but all of them were neither consistently “red” nor consistently “blue.” Romney's best moment came in the first presidential debate, in which he came across as politically moderate and personally engaging. Obama, like many incumbents, turned in a rusty and therefore ineffective performance. But, chastened by his weak showing, Obama came back strongly in the second and third debates and regained his lead over Romney.\nToward the end of the campaign, the unemployment rate finally dipped below 8 percent, reinforcing Obama's claim that his economic policies had placed the nation on the road to prosperity. He also benefited from his response to Hurricane Sandy, a “super storm” that struck the Northeast in late October. Obama toured the devastated New Jersey shore with the state’s Republican governor, Chris Christie, who praised the president for “springing into action immediately.” In the election day exit poll, 15 percent of voters said that Obama's reaction to the hurricane was the most important factor in their decision, and 73 percent of them voted for the president.\nObama defeated Romney by 51 percent to 47 percent in the national popular vote and by 332 to 206 in the electoral vote. His margin of victory was down slightly from 2008, making him the first president since Woodrow Wilson to be reelected by a smaller majority than in his first election. Also disappointing to Obama, the House of Representatives remained in Republican control, by a margin to 234 to 201. Obama—and Democrats generally—took heart from the party’s success in the Senate elections. Even though twenty-three of their seats were on the ballot in 2012 compared with only ten for the Republicans, the Democrats actually gained two seats in the election, raising their majority in the upper chamber to 55 to 45. Still more important for the long term, Obama ran best among those groups in the electorate that were growing most rapidly: young people, single people, nonreligious people, Latinos, and Asian Americans.\nDespite his victories, Obama began his second term with a very limited mandate. His campaign's one-word theme was content-free—Forward!—and most of his speeches and commercials during the election were devoted to tearing down Romney rather than offering a policy agenda for the second term. The one specific issue Obama did stress on the campaign trail—his continuing desire to raise taxes on wealthy Americans—bore fruit one month after the election, when Congress voted to raise the marginal income tax rate from 35.0 percent to 39.6 percent on households with annual incomes above $450,000. But during the campaign, he deemphasized other issues that were important to him but politically risky, including immigration reform, climate change, and gun control.\nMidterm Election of 2014\nThe 2014 midterm election repeated the pattern of Obama’s first term: success in the presidential election followed by defeat two years later at midterm. As in 2010, voter turnout was considerably lower in 2014 than it had been two years previously: 34 percent in 2014 (the lowest in a national election since 1942) compared with 58 percent in 2012. Because midterm electorates tend to have a higher concentration of the older and more conservative white voters who tend to favor Republican candidates, the Democrats were likely to suffer. Adding to their disadvantage in the Senate elections was that Democrats held 21 of 36 seats on the ballot in 2014, seven of them in states that Obama had lost to Romney.\nRepublicans gained nine seats in the Senate elections, the largest gain for any party since 1980, and took away control of the chamber from the Democrats with a 54-46 majority. In elections to the House of Representatives, the GOP added 13 seats to their majority, increasing it to 247-188, the party’s largest House majority since 1928. The Republicans’ success extended to elections for state office. They added two to their ranks of governors, leaving them in control of the executive in 31 states. They also won majorities in ten additional state legislative chambers, giving them control of 67 of 99. These showings, too, were the GOP’s best since 1928.\nThe 2014 midterm election guaranteed that Obama spent the last two years of his presidency with a Republican Congress. According to Politico, on the morning after the election “he told his staff to take an hour to mope, then get back to work.” Signaling his intention going forward to rely strongly on his executive authority rather than seek legislation from Congress, he added: “We still run the largest organization on the planet, with the largest capacity to do good.”\nPostscript on the 2016 Election\nAlthough the 22nd Amendment barred Obama from seeking a third term as president in 2016, he was intensely interested in seeing a Democrat succeed him, especially because all of the contenders for the Republican presidential nomination promised to seek the repeal of major parts of his legislative legacy if one of them was elected. Obama did not endorse either of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, but he clearly favored Clinton as the most electable and privately discouraged Vice President Biden from entering the contest for fear of dividing his supporters between Biden and Clinton.\nIn the fall 2016 campaign, Obama campaigned ardently in multiple battleground states for Clinton and against the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, whom he described as “temperamentally unfit to be president.” Of Clinton, Obama declared, “There has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than Hillary Clinton.” Two days after Donald Trump won the election, however, Obama met with him at the White House publicly told him, “We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.”\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        |\nIn 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore launched their economic strategy: (1) establishing\nfiscal discipline, eliminating the budget deficit, keeping interest rates low, and spurring private-sector\ninvestment; (2) investing in people through education, training, science, and research; and (3) opening foreign\nmarkets so American workers can compete abroad. After eight years, the results of President Clinton's economic\nleadership are clear. Record budget deficits have become record surpluses, 22 million new jobs have been\ncreated, unemployment and core inflation are at their lowest levels in more than 30 years, and America is in the\nmidst of the longest economic expansion in our history.\nPresident Clinton's Record on the Economy: In 1992, 10 million Americans were unemployed, the\ncountry faced record deficits, and poverty and welfare rolls were growing. Family incomes were losing ground\nto inflation and jobs were being created at the slowest rate since the Great Depression. Today, America enjoys\nwhat may be the strongest economy ever.\n-\nStrong Economic Growth: Since President Clinton and Vice President Gore took office, economic growth has\naveraged 4.0 percent per year, compared to average growth of 2.8 percent during the Reagan-Bush years.\nThe economy has grown for 116 consecutive months, the most in history.\n-\nMost New Jobs Ever Created Under a Single Administration: The economy has created more than 22.5 million jobs\nin less than eight yearsthe most jobs ever created under a single administration, and more than were\ncreated in the previous 12 years. Of the total new jobs, 20.7 million, or 92 percent, are in the private\nsector.\n-\nMedian Family Income Up $6,000 since 1993: Economic gains have been made across the spectrum as family incomes\nincreased for all Americans. Since 1993, real median family income has increased by $6,338, from $42,612 in\n1993 to $48,950 in 1999 (in 1999 dollars).\n-\nUnemployment at Its Lowest Level in More than 30 Years: Overall unemployment has dropped to the lowest level\nin more than 30 years, down from 6.9 percent in 1993 to just 4.0 percent in November 2000. The unemployment\nrate has been below 5 percent for 40 consecutive months. Unemployment for African Americans has fallen from\n14.2 percent in 1992 to 7.3 percent in October 2000, the lowest rate on record. Unemployment for Hispanics\nhas fallen from 11.8 percent in October 1992 to 5.0 percent in October 2000, also the lowest rate on record.\n-\nLowest Inflation since the 1960s: Inflation is at the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, averaging\n2.5 percent, and it is down from 4.7 percent during the previous administration.\n-\nHighest Homeownership Rate on Record: The homeownership rate reached 67.7 percent for the third quarter of\n2000, the highest rate on record. In contrast, the homeownership rate fell from 65.6 percent in the first\nquarter of 1981 to 63.7 percent in the first quarter of 1993.\n-\n7 Million Fewer Americans Living in Poverty: The poverty rate has declined from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 11.8\npercent last year, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. There are now 7 million fewer\npeople in poverty than there were in 1993.\nEstablishing Fiscal Discipline and Paying off the National Debt\nPresident Clinton's Record on Fiscal Discipline: Between 1981 and 1992, the national debt held by\nthe public quadrupled. The annual budget deficit grew to $290 billion in 1992, the largest ever, and was\nprojected to grow to more than $455 billion by Fiscal Year (FY) 2000. As a result of the tough and sometimes\nunpopular choices made by President Clinton, and major deficit reduction legislation passed in 1993 and 1997, we\nhave seen eight consecutive years of fiscal improvement for the first time in America's history.\n-\nLargest Surplus Ever: The surplus in FY 2000 is $237 billionthe third consecutive surplus and the\nlargest surplus ever.\n-\nLargest Three-Year Debt Pay-Down Ever: Between 1998-2000, the publicly held debt was reduced by $363\nbillionthe largest three-year pay-down in American history. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush,\nthe debt held by the public quadrupled. Under the Clinton-Gore budget, we are on track to pay off the\nentire publicly held debt on a net basis by 2009.\n-\nLower Federal Government Spending: After increasing under the previous two administrations, federal government\nspending as a share of the economy has been cut from 22.2 percent in 1992 to 18 percent in 2000the\nlowest level since 1966.\n-\nReduced Interest Payments on the Debt: In 1993, the net interest payments on the debt held by the public were\nprojected to grow to $348 billion in FY 2000. In 2000, interest payments on the debt were $125 billion lower\nthan projected.\n-\nAmericans Benefit from Reduced Debt: Because of fiscal discipline and deficit and debt reduction, it is\nestimated that a family with a home mortgage of $100,000 might expect to save roughly $2,000 per year in\nmortgage payments, like a large tax cut.\n-\nDouble Digit Growth in Private Investment in Equipment and Software: Lower debt will help maintain strong\neconomic growth and fuel private investments. With government no longer draining resources out of capital\nmarkets, private investment in equipment and software averaged 13.3 percent annual growth since 1993, compared\nto 4.7 percent during 1981 to 1992.\nTo Establish Fiscal Discipline, President Clinton:\n-\nEnacted the 1993 Deficit Reduction Plan without a Single Republican Vote. Prior to 1993, the debate over\nfiscal policy often revolved around a false choice between public investment and deficit reduction. The 1993\ndeficit reduction plan showed that deficit and debt reductions could be accomplished in a progressive way by\nslashing the deficit in half and making important investments in our future, including education, health care,\nand science and technology research. The plan included more than $500 billion in deficit reduction. It also\ncut taxes for 15 million of the hardest-pressed Americans by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit; created\nthe Direct Student Loan Program; created the first nine Empowerment Zones and first 95 Enterprise Communities;\nand passed tax cuts for small businesses and research and development.\n-\nNegotiated the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. In his 1997 State of the Union address, President\nClinton announced his plan to balance the budget for the first time in 27 years. Later that year, he signed\nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a major bipartisan agreement to eliminate the national budget deficit, create\nthe conditions for economic growth, and invest in the education and health of our people. It provided\nmiddle-class tax relief with a $500 per child tax credit and the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax\ncredits for college. It also created the Children's Health Insurance Program to serve up to 5 million\nchildren and made landmark investments in education initiatives including educational technology, charter\nschools, Head Start, and Pell Grants. Finally, it added 20 more Empowerment Zones and 20 more rural Enterprise\nCommunities, included the President's plan to revitalize the District of Columbia, and continued welfare\nreform though $3 billion in new resources to move welfare recipients to private-sector jobs.\n-\nDedicated the Surplus to Save Social Security and Reduce the National Debt. In his 1998 and 1999 State\nof the Union addresses, President Clinton called on the nation to save the surplus until the solvency of\nSocial Security is assured. He also repeatedly vetoed large Republican tax cut bills that would have\njeopardized our nation's fiscal discipline. The President's actions led to a bipartisan consensus on saving\nthe surplus and paying down the debt.\n-\nExtended Medicare Solvency from 1999 to 2025. When President Clinton took office, Medicare was\nexpected to become insolvent in 1999, then only six years away. The 1993 deficit reduction act dedicated\nsome of the taxes paid by Social Security beneficiaries to the Medicare Trust Fund and extended the life of\nMedicare by three years to 2002. Thanks to additional provisions to combat waste, fraud and abuse and\nbipartisan cooperation in the 1997 balanced budget agreement, Medicare is now expected to remain solvent until\n2025.\n|\nClinton-Gore Economic Policy Has Dramatically Improved the Economy\n\"My colleagues and I have been very appreciative of your [President Clinton's] support of the Fed over the\nyears, and your commitment to fiscal discipline has been instrumental in achieving what in a few weeks will be\nthe longest economic expansion in the nation's history.\"\nAlan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, January 4, 2000, with President Clinton at\nChairman Greenspan's re-nomination announcement\n\"The deficit has come down, and I give the Clinton Administration and President Clinton himself a lot of\ncredit for that. [He] did something about it, fast. And I think we are seeing some benefits.\"\nPaul Volcker, Federal Reserve Board Chairman (1979-1987), in Audacity, Fall 1994\nOne of the reasons Goldman Sachs cites for the \"best economy ever\" is that \"on the policy side, trade,\nfiscal, and monetary policies have been excellent, working in ways that have facilitated growth without\ninflation. The Clinton Administration has worked to liberalize trade and has used any revenue windfalls to\nreduce the federal budget deficit.\"\nGoldman Sachs, March 1998\n\"Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion over five years,\nsparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and systems that\nbrought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity.\"\nBusiness Week, May 19, 1997\n|\nOpening World Markets to American Goods and Providing Leadership on Globalization\nPresident Clinton's Record on Trade and Globalization: In 1992, 10 million Americans were\nunemployed, new job creation was slow, and wages were stagnant. Other nations' high trade barriers limited the\nability of American businesses and farmers to sell their goods abroad and hampered economic recovery. Our trade\npolicies failed to reflect our values by failing to take into account the responsibility to protect our\nenvironment, eliminate child labor and sweatshops, and protect the rights of workers around the world.\nBut today:\n-\n300 Trade Agreements: President Clinton has opened markets for U.S. exports abroad and created American jobs through nearly 300 free and fair trade agreements.\n-\nThe Most U.S. Exports Ever. Between 1992 and 2000, U.S. exports of goods and services grew by 74 percent, or nearly $500 billion, to top $1 trillion for the first time.\n-\n1.4 Million More Jobs due to Exports: Jobs supported by American exports grew by 1.4 million between 1994 and 1998, with jobs supported by exports paying about 13 percent to 16 percent above the U.S. national average. Jobs related to goods exports pay, on average, 13 to 16 percent higher than other jobs.\n-\nLowest Inflation since the 1960s: Inflation is at the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, in part because global competition has kept prices low. It has averaged 2.5 percent under this Administration, down from 4.6 percent during the previous administration.\nTo Create Trade Opportunities and Expand the Benefits of Globalization, President Clinton:\n-\nWon Ratification of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, creating the world's largest\nfree\ntrade zone of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. U.S. exports to Mexico grew 109 percent from 1993 to 1999, while exports to the rest of the world grew by 49 percent.\n-\nWon Approval of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. In 2000, Congress ratified permanent normal trade relations with China. The agreement will integrate China into the world economy through entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), open Chinese market to U.S. exports, slash Chinese tariffs, and protect American workers and companies against dumping.\n-\nSuccessfully Completed the Uruguay Round. The 1994 Uruguay Round transformed the world trading system, opening markets in a wide range of industries, enabling the U.S. to enforce agreements more effectively, and applying the rules for the first time to all WTO members (now 138 in total).\n-\nFought for the First-Ever African and the Caribbean Basin Trade Bills. The African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 will support increased trade and investment between the United States and Africa, strengthen African economies and democratic governments, and increase partnerships to counter terrorism, crime, environmental degradation and disease. The legislation will also create incentives for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin to continue reforming their economies.\n-\nPromoted Trade Opportunities for High Technology. The Clinton Administration completed series of trade agreements on technology, including the WTO's commitment to duty-free cyberspace, keeping the Internet free of trade barriers, in 1998; the global WTO agreements on Financial Services and Basic Telecommunications in 1997; the global WTO agreement on Information Technology in 1996; and a series of bilateral agreements on intellectual property, high-tech products, services and other sectors. These efforts are the building blocks of the New Economy.\n-\nSecured Historic Debt Relief. In March 1999, President Clinton presented a plan to a U.S.-Africa Summit in Washington that became the basis for the G-7 agreement in Cologne, Germany (known as the Cologne Debt Initiative). The plan would triple the amount of debt relief available for poor countries, reducing their debt by about 70 percent ($90 billion), in return for firm commitments to channel the benefits into improving the lives of all their people. In September 1999, the President announced that the U.S. would unilaterally exceed the terms of the G-7 initiative and entirely cancel the $5.7 billion in U.S. government debt owed by qualifying countries. In November 2000, President Clinton won $435 million from Congress for U.S. participation in the Cologne Initiative.\n-\nDramatically Expanded U.S. Efforts to Fight Child Labor and Expand Basic Education. In June 1999, the President traveled to the International Labor Organization (ILO) conference in Geneva, Switzerland, to urge adoption of an historic international convention banning the worst forms of child labor. He won $30 million for ILO enforcement of child labor laws and is fighting for a new initiative to promote basic education in areas of the world where child labor is widespread. In 2000, at U.S. urging, the G-8 countries endorsed the goal of universal basic education. President Clinton brought other issues to the forefront of the international economic agenda, including incorporating labor and environmental considerations in the work of major international economic institutions, increasing U.S. support for global efforts to fight HIV-AIDS and infectious diseases, and closing the digital divide.\n-\nDefused International Economic Crises. In 1995, after Congress refused to act, President Clinton made $20 billion in emergency loans to Mexico to stabilize the country's financial markets. Mexico repaid the loans in full, with interest, three years ahead of schedule. Following the Asian and Russian financial crises in 1997 and 1998, the Clinton-Gore Administration led a global effort to re-capitalize the International Monetary Fund to allow it to more effectively deal with these problems. President Clinton also insisted that the G-7 develop a set of measures to restore confidence in the world financial system.\n-\nPromoted U.S. Competitiveness. The Clinton-Gore Administration has made key investments in education and training for American workers and research and development. It has also maintained federal fiscal discipline, helping to reduce interest rates, encourage private-sector investment, and keep productivity high.\nRewarding Work and Empowering Communities\nPresident Clinton's Record on Rewarding Work: In 1992, unemployment reached 7.5 percent, the\nhighest level in eight years. Unemployment and poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanics were\nalarming: unemployment reached 14.2 percent for African Americans and 11.8 percent for Hispanics, and poverty\nrates for both groups were nearly 30 percent. But today:\n-\nHigher Incomes at All Levels: After years of stagnant income growth among average and lower-income families, all income brackets have experienced double-digit income growth since 1993. The bottom 20 percent saw the largest income growth at 16.3 percent.\n-\nLowest Poverty Rate in 20 Years: Since Congress passed President Clinton's Economic Plan in 1993, the poverty rate declined from 15.1 percent to 11.8 percent last year, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. There are now 7 million fewer people in poverty than there were in 1993. The child poverty rate has declined more than 25 percent, the poverty rate for single mothers is the lowest ever, the African American and elderly poverty rates dropped to their lowest level on record, and the Hispanic poverty rate dropped to its lowest level since 1979.\n-\nLowest Poverty Rate for Single Mothers on Record: Under President Clinton, the poverty rate for families with single mothers has fallen from 46.1 percent in 1993 to 35.7 percent in 1999, the lowest level on record. Between 1980 and 1992, an additional 2.1 million households headed by single women were pushed into poverty.\n-\nSmallest Welfare Rolls Since 1969: Under the Clinton-Gore Administration, the welfare rolls have dropped\ndramatically and are now the lowest since 1969. Between January 1993 and September of 1999, the number of welfare recipients dropped by 7.5 million (a 53 percent decline) to 6.6 million. In comparison, between 1981-1992, the number of welfare recipients increased by 2.5 million (a 22 percent increase) to 13.6 million people.\nTo Help All Americans Benefit from Prosperity, President Clinton:\n-\nEnded Welfare as We Knew It. In 1996, President Clinton signed legislation requiring welfare recipients to work, limiting the time they can stay on welfare, and providing child care and health care to help them begin work. It also enacted tough new child support enforcement measures proposed by the President. In 1997, President Clinton won the welfare-to-work tax credit to encourage employers to hire long-term welfare recipients and $3 billion in additional resources to help communities move long-term welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs.\n-\nRewarded Work by Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 1993, President Clinton succeeded in winning passage of an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, giving a tax cut to 15 million of the hardest-pressed American workers. In 1999, the EITC lifted 4.1 million people out of poverty, nearly double the number lifted out of poverty by the EITC in 1993.\n-\nCreated Empowerment Zones. The 1993 Clinton-Gore economic plan created nine Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities to spur local community planning and economic growth in distressed communities through tax incentives and federal investment. The President won expansions of the program in 1994, 1997, and again in 2000. To date, the 31 Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities have leveraged over $10 billion in new private sector investment, creating thousands of new jobs for local residents.\n-\nCreated Community Development Financial Institutions. In September 1994, the President signed legislation creating the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, a Clinton campaign proposal to support specialized financial institutions serving often-overlooked customers and communities. The Fund has certified over 400 CDFIs. It has provided over $427 million to match investments in CDFIs and to encourage traditional financial institutions to increase their lending, investment and services in under-served markets.\n-\nStrengthened the Community Reinvestment Act. In 1995, the Administration updated the Community Reinvestment Act regulations to focus on banks' actual service delivery, rather than on compliance efforts. From 1993 to 1998, lenders subject to the law increased mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income families by 80 percentmore than twice the rate they increased mortgage lending to other income groups.\n-\nEncouraged Investment in America's New Markets. In 1999, the President went on two historic \"New Markets\" trips to highlight the continuing need to bring investment to impoverished inner cities, rural communities and Native American tribal lands. In 2000, the President and Congress worked together to pass this bipartisan initiative to stimulate new private capital investments in economically distressed communities and build network of private investment institutions to funnel credit, equity and technical assistance to businesses in America's new markets.\n-\nRaised the Minimum Wage. In 1996, President Clinton and Vice President Gore fought for and won a 90-cent per hour increase in the minimum wage, helping 10 million workers.\n-\nHelped People with Disabilities Work. In 1999, President Clinton insisted that Congress pass the Work Incentives Improvement Act as a condition of the budget agreement. This bipartisan law allows people with disabilities to maintain their Medicare or Medicaid coverage when they work.\nModernizing for the New Economy through Technology and Consensus Deregulation\nTo Capitalize on the Information Technology Revolution, President Clinton and Vice President Gore Have:\n-\nModernized Financial Services Laws. In 1993, the laws that governed America's financial service sector were antiquated and anti-competitive. The Clinton-Gore Administration fought to modernize those laws to increase competition in traditional banking, insurance, and securities industries to give consumers and small businesses more choices and lower costs. In 1994, the Clinton-Gore Administration broke another decades-old logjam by allowing banks to branch across state lines in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. President Clinton fought for and won financial modernization legislation, signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999.\n-\nReformed Telecommunications. In 1996, President Clinton signed legislation to open up competition between local telephone companies, long distance providers and cable companies. The law also requires the use of new V-chip technology to give families greater control over which television programming comes into their homes.\n-\nCreated the E-Rate. With the leadership of Vice President Gore, the Telecommunications Act contained the E-Rate initiative, which provides low-cost Internet connections for schools, libraries, rural health clinics and hospitals. More than 80 percent of America's public schools have benefited from the E-rate, which has helped connect 30 million children and up to 47,000 schools and libraries to the Internet. The percentage of public schools connected to the Internet has increased from 35 percent in 1994 to 95 percent in 1999. The percentage of classrooms connected to the Internet has increased from 3 percent in 1994 to 63 percent in 1999.\n-\nIncreased Resources for Educational Technology by Over 3,000 Percent. President Clinton and Vice President Gore increased our investment in educational technology by over 3,000 percent, from $23 million in FY 1994 to $769 million in FY 2000, including training over 600,000 new teachers to use technology effectively in the classroom.\n-\nPaved the Way for Electronic Commerce. President Clinton fought to eliminate legal barriers to using electronic technology to form and sign contracts, collect and store documents, and send and receive notices and disclosures, while ensuring that consumers on-line have the same protections that they have in the paper world. He signed the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act on June 30, 2000.\n-\nCreating Market Opportunities for Technology Firms. The Clinton-Gore Administration adopted a market-led approach on e-commerce, making spectrum available for digital wireless, and reforming Cold War export controls.\n-\nWorked to Close the Digital Divide. Since 1992, the President and Vice President have tripled funding for Community Technology Centers, which provide access to computers and the Internet to low-income urban and rural neighborhoods. President Clinton also challenged the private sector to develop new business models for low-cost computers and Internet access to make universal access at home affordable for all Americans. The Technology Literacy Challenge Fund has provided $1 billion in federal resources to help schools work with businesses and community organizations to put modern computers, high-quality educational software, and affordable connections to the Internet in every classroom. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created a temporary tax deduction for donations of computers to elementary and secondary schools.\n-\nForged Trade Agreements on High Technology. The Clinton Administration completed series of trade agreements on technology, including the WTO's commitment to duty-free cyberspace, keeping the Internet free of trade barriers, in 1998; the global WTO agreements on Financial Services and Basic Telecommunications in 1997; the global WTO agreement on Information Technology in 1996; and a series of bilateral agreements on intellectual property, high-tech products, services and other sectors; all soon to be capped by the opening of a major networked economy initiative.\nInvesting in Educating and Training the American People\nPresident Clinton's Record on Investing in Americans:\n-\nMore Americans Are Enrolling in College: 66 percent of 1998 high school graduates enrolled in college or trade school the next fall, compared to 60 percent in 1990.\n-\nMore High School Students Are Preparing for College: The percentage of high school graduates who have taken four years of English and three years each of math, science, and social studies increased from 38 percent to 55 percent between 1990 and 1998. Research shows that high-quality academics in high school is key to college success.\n-\nMore Americans Are Earning College Degrees: Over 32 percent of 25- to 29-year-old high school graduates had earned at least a bachelor's degree in 1999, up from 27 percent in 1990. In particular, white and African American women have seen their college opportunities grow.\n-\nAmericans Are Becoming Lifelong Learners: 50 percent of adults participated in formal learning in the year prior to a 1999 survey, up from 38 percent in 1991.\nTo Provide Americans with More, Higher-Quality Education and Training, President Clinton:\n-\nCreated the College Tax Credits, the Largest Single Investment in Higher Education since the G.I. Bill. A $1,500 tax credit for the first two years of college, the Hope Scholarship will pay for nearly all of a typical community college's tuition and fees. The $1,000 Lifetime Learning Tax Credit reimburses families for 20 percent of their tuition and fees (up to $5,000 per family) for college, graduate study, or job training. Starting in 2003, the credit will reimburse families for 20 percent of their costs up to $10,000, for a maximum value of $2,000. This year, 10 million American families will save over $7 billion through the college tax credits.\n-\nDoubled Student Financial Aid. Students will receive over $50 billion in federal grants, loans, and work-study aid this year, up from $25 billion in 1993. President Clinton has consistently supported budget increases for Pell Grants; this year, over 3.8 million needy students receive a Pell Grant scholarship of up to $3,300, a $1,000 larger maximum grant than in 1993. The President won another increase for Pell Grants in the FY 2001 budget, bringing the maximum grant to $3,750. The President also won increases in work-study funding to help one million students pay for college.\n-\nCreated Direct Student Loans and Reduced Interest Rates. In the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, President Clinton won the Direct Student Loan program to improve customer service and compete with guaranteed lenders. It has saved taxpayers over $4 billion so far by eliminating lender subsidies. President Clinton also fought to reduce interest rates and fees in the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 and the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. As a result, students can expect to pay $1,300 less in interest and fees for the average $10,000 loan than they would have in 1992. The student loan default rate is now 6.9 percent, down from 22.4 percent eight years ago.\n-\nCreated New Paths to College through GEAR UP, AmeriCorps, and TRIO. President Clinton won the new GEAR UP initiative in the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 which is already helping 700,000 low-income middle school students prepare for college. Over 150,000 Americans have earned money for college while serving their communities through President Clinton's AmeriCorps program, a campaign promise enacted in 1993. To help disadvantaged youth prepare for and succeed in college, the TRIO programs have grown by $342 million over the past eight years.\n-\nStrengthened Elementary and Secondary Education. In 1994, President Clinton reformed federal education initiatives in the Improving America's Schools Act and the Goals 2000 Act. The President's new approach was grounded in the principles that all of America's students should meet high academic standards and the federal government should make new investments to help them meet those standards. The President has also fought to hire 100,000 teachers, promote educational technology, support charter schools, build K-16 partnerships, and focus on early reading through America Reads.\n-\nPassed the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. In 1992, President Clinton and Vice President Gore proposed to streamline and bring greater accountability to our nation's job training system. In 1998, they won legislation to meet the needs of both America's workers and businesses by encouraging local control of training and employment programs; helping customers locate assistance through one-stop centers; and empower adults to receive the training they need.\nReducing Tax Burdens for Average and Hard-Pressed Working Families.\nThe Clinton Record on Reducing Taxes for Working Families:\n-\nLowest Federal Income Tax Burden in 35 Years: Federal income taxes as a percentage of income for the typical American family have dropped to their lowest level in 35 years.\n-\nHigher Incomes even after Taxes and Inflation: Real after-tax incomes have grown for Americans at all income levels, much faster than they did prior to the Clinton-Gore Administration. Real after-tax incomes grew by an average of 2.6 percent per year for the lower-income half of taxpayers between 1993 and 1997, while growing by an average of 1.0 percent between 1981 and 1993.\nTo Cut Taxes for Working Americans, President Clinton:\n-\nExpanded the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 1993, President Clinton succeeded in expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, giving a tax cut to 15 million of the hardest-pressed American workers. In 1999, the EITC lifted 4.1 million people out of poverty, nearly double the number lifted out of poverty by the EITC in 1993.\n-\nCreated the $500 per Child Tax Credit. In 1997, President Clinton secured a $500 per child tax credit for 27 million families with children under 17, including 13 million children from families with incomes below $30,000.\n-\nWon the Hope Scholarship Tax Credit. President Clinton proposed tax credits for college tuition in 1996 and signed them into law in 1997 as part of the balanced budget agreement. The Hope Scholarship provides a tax credit of up to $1,500 for tuition and fees for the first two years of college, roughly equal to the cost of the average community college. It will save American families $4.9 billion this year.\n-\nWon the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. Also enacted in 1997, the Lifetime Learning tax credit provides a 20 percent tax credit on $5,000 of tuition and fees (to be raised to $10,000 in 2003) for college and graduate students and adults taking job training. It will reduce the cost of college and job training for American families by $2.4 billion this year.\n-\nEstablished Education IRAs. The 1997 balanced budget agreement also created Education IRAs. For each child under age 18, families may now deposit $500 per year into an Education IRA in the child's name. Earnings in the Education IRA accumulate tax-free and no taxes will be due upon withdrawal if the money is used to pay for college. The law also allowed taxpayers to withdraw funds from a traditional IRA without penalty to pay for higher education for themselves or their spouse, child, or even grandchild.\n-\nCreated Empowerment Zones. President Clinton created Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in 1993 and expanded them in 1994, 1997 and again in 2000 to spur economic growth in distressed communities through tax incentives and federal investment. To date, the 31 Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities have leveraged over $10 billion in new private sector investment, creating thousands of new jobs for local residents.\n-\nSimplified Pension Rules. In 1996, President Clinton signed the SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) plan into law, simplifying and expanding retirement plan coverage for small businesses.\n-\nSimplified Tax Laws and Protected Taxpayer Rights. President Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to simplify the tax laws and enhance taxpayers' rights. The law has saved families and businesses millions of hours be simplifying and reducing paperwork, such as allowing a tax exclusion for income from the sale of a home.\n-\nClosed Tax Loopholes. To ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share, the Clinton Administration addressed the use and proliferation of corporate tax shelters by proposing several remedies to curb the growth of such shelters by increasing disclosure of sheltering activities, increasing and strengthening the substantial understatement penalty, codifying the judicially-created economic substance doctrine, and providing consequences to all parties involved in an abusive sheltering transaction.\n|\nPRESIDENT CLINTON'S ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE\nTrade Expands Opportunity for American Workers\n\"Harley-Davidson is growing rapidly, and sales to other countries is one reason why. President Clinton's efforts to open foreign markets have made a difference and helped create jobs at Harley-Davidson.\"\nBobby Ramsey began working at the Harley-Davidson York plant in 1972 and is now responsible for inspecting all incoming motorcycle parts prior to the assembly process. Since 1995, Mr. Ramsey has also been his union's Chief Shop Steward, which entails handling all second step grievances of workers and helping represent his co-workers to management. U.S. exports of motorcycles and parts have grown by 15 percent a year from 1987 to 1998, reaching one-third of industry sales. Harley-Davidson will export 22 percent of the motorcycles produced in Mr. Ramsey's plant. By 2003, Harley-Davidson expects to double production from 1996 levels largely because of exports, creating new jobs for American workers.\n\"Kodak and its employees have experienced significant gains because of NAFTA. The NAFTA has enabled Kodak to realize considerable tariff savings and to make production decisions based on rational economic grounds rather than on tariff considerations. For example, the agreement has enabled Kodak to transfer a high-cost sensitizing operation for color negative film from Mexico to Rochester, New York. In all, NAFTA has been a win-win-win for Kodak's operations in Canada, Mexico and the United States.\"\nDan Carp, President and CEO of the Eastman Kodak company, credits NAFTA with Kodak's rapid growth in export sales. Eastman Kodak manufactures high technology imaging products for sale in 160 countries. Under NAFTA, Mexican duties on film and photo paper have been reduced from 15 to 30 percent to 6 to 9 percent, and they will be eliminated by 2004. Kodak's exports to Mexico have more than doubled since 1993, creating greater stability and more job opportunities for Kodak's 54,000 employees.\nMaking the Dream of Homeownership a Reality\n\"I feel true independence in owning my own home. To those who think it's impossible: It is possible. Don't let anyone talk you out of it.\"\nLucy Vocu, a teacher and single mother. Lucy Vocu has lived on the Pine Ridge reservation all her life. In 1985, Lucy got her GED, and in 1994, she graduated from Oglala Lakota College with a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. She currently works for the Shannon County school system at Wolf Creek School. Her children, Grace, 15, and Jacob, 7, spend a lot of time using their computer. Jacob recently tracked tornadoes on the Internet. Lucy is a first-time homeowner. She moved from a two-bedroom rental house into this new three-bedroom home, which offers more privacy. Lucy is excited about being a new homeowner and, if her budget allows, she hopes to add to her new home a swing set for Jacob and a basketball net for Grace.\n|\n|\n\"The social workers at Marion House, which has received funding from HUD's homeless grants, helped me get back on my feet. They counseled me on how to find a job and helped me learn the skills I would need to stay employed. Today I am newly married, and I have been working the last four years as a secretary for a social service agency. And I am delighted to say . . . I am a homeowner. Because of your leadership President Clinton, and because of your commitment to providing funding for homeless programs across the country, there will be hope and optimism in place of despair.\"\nChrista Spangler, of Baltimore, MD, December 23, 1998. Christa Spangler was a formerly homeless woman who hit rock bottom in 1994 when she was forced to live in her car. Previously, she had lost custody of her children, and spent eleven years in and out of halfway houses, rehab clinics, and hospitals. She found her way to Marion House, a Catholic transitional housing program for homeless women and children. Christa is now married, working as a receptionist and living in her own home. Federal resources pay 25 percent of the Marion House budget.\nEmpowerment Zones Are a Potent Weapon Against Poverty\n\"I am living proof that the Empowerment Zone works! If it wasn't for the Empowerment Zone, I would have never have had the chance to buy this building or to expand my business. We are fighting the war against poverty throughout our neighborhoods and cities, but we have a very potent weapon the Empowerment Zones. And we will use that weapon to win this war because, after all, our future and our children's future depends on it. We must never give up hope.\"\nNancy Santana, 37, is a single mother of three who lives in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She used resources and a loan she obtained through her local Empowerment Zone to move from welfare to start her own business, Nancy Santana's Cleaning and Maintenance Services. Four years later, her business employs over 25 people, many of whom she recruited off of welfare.\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions Expand Economic Opportunity\n\"President Clinton's efforts have been very helpful to me. I had trouble getting funding from other sources. The Enterprise Corporation of the Delta has worked with me and people in my community, helping us improve our position in life. Now, I can get into this business, where otherwise I could not have.\"\nEphron Lewis co-founded Lewis & Sons Rice Processing the only African-American-owned rice processing company in the country with his father. The construction of his plant was made possible by a loan and technical assistance from the Enterprise Corporation of the Delta, a community development financial institution supported by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He now farms roughly 3,000 acres, producing rice, wheat and soybeans.\n|\n|\nEncouraging the Growth of Small Businesses\n\"I started my small consulting and legal firm with the principle that everyone should have a shot at the twin American dreams of owning your own business and owning your own home. I look for the dreamers, the ones who want to be a part of this country in the best way, but who don't have the tools and information they need. I hope to be an instrument of growth and change in Brooklyn's Latino community through increased business opportunities. This SBA loan will allow me to set up an office outside my home, close to where I can make the most of the services I have to offer.\"\nEnealia Nau, Small Business Owner from Brooklyn, NY. Enealia Nau is a first-generation American who operates a small business consulting firm from her home in Brooklyn. After putting herself through college and law school, Ms. Nau started her consulting firm that focuses on the legal and financial needs of the minority communities from which she draws her clients. Ms. Nau helps families from minority communities realize the American dream through starting their own businesses from beauty shops to corner stores and buying their first homes. She has seen many clients start from nothing and build prosperous lives for their families through small businesses, including one client who started with a small \"bodega\" and now owns one of the largest grocery stores in Brooklyn.\nExpanding Economic Opportunity by Closing the Digital Divide\n\"Bridging the technology gap in Indian Country is a major challenge, and I am grateful for the attention that the Clinton Administration has given to this critical issue. The National Congress of American Indians is building on the initiatives announced during the President's Digital Divide tour stop at the Navajo Nation in April 2000 through its Tribal Leaders Digital Divide Task Force, funded through the AOL Foundation. Through the Task Force, we are actively working with industry, federal officials, and others to forge a new tribal-based partnerships and policy recommendations to close the technology gap.\"\nSusan Masten, President, National Congress of American Indians, and Chairwoman, Yurok Tribe. Susan Masten has served as a strong advocate for the betterment of Native communities on a local, state and national level for 22 years.\n\"Community technology centers provide low-income individuals with skills training and the ability to produce their dreams. They are also an important entryway to the technology industry. We think of President Clinton as our first angel investor; his Administration's work has been fundamental to Plugged In and to the community technology center movement.\"\nMagda Escobar, Executive Director, Plugged In, East Palo Alto, California. East Palo Alto, a low-income community, is located in Silicon Valley, the epicenter of the technological revolution. Plugged In trains teenagers and employs them in a web design business; provides a creative arts and technology studio and after-school program; and provides community members with access to computers and telecommunications equipment to increase their employment opportunities\n|\n|\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Bill Clinton: Campaigns and Elections\nThe Campaign and Election of 1992:\nBill Clinton easily defeated the leading Democratic contenders in the 1992 primaries, despite charges about having avoided the Vietnam draft and his rumored affairs with women. He dealt with the infidelity issue on national television in an interview in which he admitted to having caused \"pain\" in his marriage. Although he said he had smoked pot as a college student, he added that he \"didn't inhale,\" which struck his critics as disingenuous. Most voters seemed unconcerned with his private life or his stand on a war that had ended many years before. His opponent, President George H.W. Bush, ran a lackluster campaign that failed to convert his great successes in foreign affairs into a convincing argument to reelect him. Republican die-hards never forgave Bush for having broken his 1988 promise to not raise taxes. Middle-class Americans, moreover, had grown increasingly upset over Bush's refusal to act on the economic recession that had settled on the nation.\nClinton pounded hard on the advantages given to the rich by the Reagan revolution, the Reagan-Bush $300 billion deficit, and the dire economic prospects that faced America's younger generation. His campaign handlers, led by political strategist James Carville, posted a sign at Clinton headquarters that sprightly summarized the Clinton message: \"It's the economy, stupid.\"\nThe Bush campaign was not helped by the emergence of billionaire Ross Perot's independent candidacy, which Perot personally financed. His \"United We Stand, America\" citizens group promised a White House dedicated to patriotism, candor, honesty, and a balanced budget. Dissatisfied voters of all stripes flocked to his call, creating one of the most powerful third-party movements in American history. Although Perot drew support from both Republicans and Democrats, he probably hurt Bush disproportionately more than Clinton, owing to his harsh attacks against the incumbent and the timing of both his departure and re-entry into the 1992 campaign. But ultimately Perot's candidacy was damaged beyond repair by his own inconstant commitment to running—a posture that benefited the Clinton challenge.\nOn November 3, Clinton received more than twice the number of Electoral College votes than did Bush. Perot drew support from both parties, winning approximately 19 percent of the popular vote but no electoral votes. Clinton had delivered on his promise to do well in traditional Democratic strongholds, to win back large numbers of Reagan Democrats, and to attract middle-class Republicans. However, when his vote is compared to the combined Bush and Perot totals in 1992, it is clear that Clinton was a minority President. On the other hand, a larger percentage (55 percent) of the electorate voted in 1992 than in 1988, 1984, and 1980. And when the Clinton and Perot popular vote totals are combined (62 percent), the 1992 election amounts to a dramatic vote for change.\nThe Campaign and Election of 1994\nMidway through his first term in office, Clinton's reelection prospects were dim, given the stunning victory of Republicans in the 1994 off-year elections. For the first time in forty years, both houses of Congress were controlled by Republican lawmakers. And almost everyone blamed Clinton. His campaign promise to reform the nation's health care system was soundly defeated. His controversial executive order lifting the ban against homosexuals in the military enraged conservatives and failed to generate significant public support. Clinton's work on behalf of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) split the Democrats, many of whom feared the loss of jobs to Mexico and Canada.\nAdditionally, a barrage of political and personal scandals plagued the Clinton administration in its first term. The most damaging issue surrounded charges that the Clintons had illegally profited from their involvement with a failed savings and loan that had dealings in Arkansas real estate on the Whitewater River. Charges swirled fast and furious, specifically linking the White House to a cover-up of the Whitewater affair and the suicide of Vincent Foster, a top White House aide and close friend of Hillary Clinton. Moreover, the administration was negatively affected by allegations of suspicious commodity dealings by the First Lady (she had turned a $1,000 investment in commodities into a $100,000 profit), and the rumored sexual escapades of President Clinton while governor of Arkansas (including allegations that he had sexually harassed an Arkansas state employee, Paula Corbin Jones).\nRepublican Contract with America\nAlthough only 39 percent of the electorate voted in the 1994 congressional elections, the Republicans swept to victory. The well-organized right-wing of the Republican Party, under the leadership of Georgia congressman Newton (\"Newt\") Gingrich and assisted by the rise of conservative talk-radio (Rush Limbaugh, Oliver North, and G. Gordon Liddy), trumpeted their \"Contract with America\" to spectacular electoral response. The Contract, tested in focus groups around the nation, promised to complete the dismantling of the New Deal state that had been started under Ronald Reagan. (See Reagan biography, Domestic Affairs section, for details.) Gingrich became the Speaker of the House and Senator Robert Dole of Kansas became the Senate majority leader. Republicans controlled the House of Representatives 230 to 204 and held 53 Senate seats to the Democrats' 47 seats. Pollsters and political commentators predicted the end of the Clinton presidency—indeed, had the United States operated with a parliamentary system of government, Clinton would have been driven from office. Clearly, the 1994 election had been a dramatic political repudiation of the President.\nWithin two years, however, the Republican ascendancy and Contract with America was in a shambles. In January 1996, President Clinton delivered a State of the Union address that waxed eloquently about the future. His ratings were on the rise, and it looked as if the Comeback Kid stood a good chance to do what no Democrat had accomplished since FDR: serve two consecutive elected terms to the presidency. What had happened?Part of the answer rests with the over extension of the Republican charge. House Republicans had used the Contract as an inflexible governing plan when in fact American voters had never clearly endorsed its particulars. By 1996, Gingrich's no-holds barred attack on government programs had frightened many moderate Republicans. Americans began to wonder about the long-range consequences, for example, of dismantling environmental protection programs. Most importantly, when the Republicans proposed drastic cuts in Medicare expenditures coupled with a tax-cut disproportionately pegged to benefit the wealthy, an anti-Gingrich backlash began to roll across the nation. Americans grew weary of the nonstop personal attacks on Clinton and the First Lady by conservative ideologues they linked to the House Republicans. Millions of Americans began to identify the Republican majority in the House with a fringe \"mean streak\" in politics that offended their sense of fair play.\nFinally, the Republican majority stumbled badly when it decided to force a government shut down unless Clinton signed its budget. Clinton, sensing the opportunity to show his mettle, vetoed Republican-passed spending bills in the fall of 1995, citing proposed cuts in education and Medicaid as being unfair. The U.S. government closed its doors twice, first for six days in November and again for twenty-one days in December 1995. Three-quarters of a million federal workers were caught in the middle of this political jousting just before Christmas, left to wonder whether they would be paid during the holiday season. Angry Americans, faced with locked government offices and closed national parks, blamed the Republicans, forcing them to back down and pass a temporary measure to reopen the government on January 5, 1996. Voters who had once urged the Republicans onward in their attacks on big government now applauded Clinton for protecting their interests.\nRepublican Challenger Robert Dole\nFor most of the time after 1994, Senator Robert Dole was the hands-down front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. The only serious question was whether retired general Colin Powell would run. But Powell removed himself from contention, in 1995, leaving Dole as the man to beat. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, millionaire publisher Steven Forbes, and right-wing gadfly Patrick Buchanan squared off in the early primaries. Buchanan did well in New Hampshire, and Forbes's expensive commercials (in which he advocated a universal \"flat tax\") forced Dole to spend precious dollars in response. Nevertheless, Dole took the key South Carolina primary on March 2, which positioned him to win enough delegate votes to sew-up the nomination by April.\nMindful of the disastrous Republican convention in 1992, Dole's handlers tried hard to distance the candidate from the far right without losing its support. In his nomination acceptance speech, he promised a 15 percent tax cut and announced his commitment to a \"fairer, flatter tax\"—a clear attempt to appeal to Forbes supporters. Moderate Republicans worried that the nominee's acceptance of a tax cut and a flat tax meant his conversion to Ronald Reagan \"supply-side\" economics, a sharp contrast to Dole's traditional interest in balancing the budget. When he announced that New Yorker Jack Kemp, a conservative, tax-cutting former congressman and member of the Bush administration, would be his running mate, Dole's moderate supporters feared the worst. A high point at the convention came with an informal and chatty speech by Dole's wife, the popular Elizabeth Dole, who went right into the audience, imitating the style of television talk-show hosts.\nDole headed into the campaign significantly behind Clinton in the polls. Although Dole received high marks for his integrity, his age (seventy-three), speaking style, and excessively dry wit worked against him. Dole tried hard to play up his combat record in World War II (during which he had lost the use of an arm) and his experience in office. But he seemed out of touch with a more youthful America. At one point, he criticized Hollywood and its amoral values. But instead of giving him a boost, the pitch came across to many as the ramblings of an old man. Most voters were fully aware that Dole would most likely be the last presidential candidate to have fought in World War II, a war that seemed like ancient history to the \"baby boomers\" (those born just after the war) of Clinton's generation.\nThe Ross Perot Candidacy\nAs with the 1992 election, Ross Perot again jumped into the fray, using his newly organized Reform Party to mount an independent bid for the presidency. The former governor of Colorado, Richard Lamm, challenged Perot for the Reform Party nomination but lost badly. Similar to his 1992 campaign tactics, Perot attacked both major party candidates. However, he failed to capture the public's attention to the same degree as in 1992. His selection of the little-known Washington author Pat Choate as his running mate did not help his campaign. Neither Clinton nor Dole agreed to debate Perot, and when the federal courts denied Perot's suit for a place in the debates, the third party candidate remained largely on the sidelines.\nEngineering a Presidential Comeback\nStarting in 1995, after Clinton defeated the Republicans in the budget battles, he engineered one of the most impressive comebacks in presidential campaign history. Clinton moved decisively to emphasize his earlier commitments to reforms aimed at the middle class. To that end, Clinton brought Dick Morris back into his strategy team. As the President's old friend and political consultant who had helped engineer his gubernatorial comeback in 1982, Morris quickly identified the key issues where Clinton could preempt the Republicans: crime, welfare reform, the federal budget, and affirmative action. Morris came up with a strategy in which Clinton distanced himself not only from radical Republicans but also from the liberals in his own Democratic Party.\nClinton embraced much of what Morris recommended. Seeking the public endorsement of police associations, Clinton supported a crime bill, claiming it would put 100,000 new police officers on the streets; he also championed anti-assault weapons measures. In addition, the President promoted the goal of a two-year limit on how long a person could remain on welfare—a stance that angered many in his party. He also focused on tax policies which targeted the middle class while shifting the burden to the upper class.\nAlong with his shift in strategy away from health care to more acceptable middle-class goals, Clinton capitalized on various opportunities during 1995 to improve his public standing. He delivered a stirring eulogy for government workers who had died when home-grown terrorists destroyed a federal building in Oklahoma City. He sprang to the defense of religious congregations whose churches had been burned in what appeared to be racially motivated arson attacks. The President's much-criticized decision in August of 1995 to authorize air strikes against the Serbs in Bosnia had unexpectedly produced a cease-fire within a month, giving Clinton the image of competence in foreign affairs.\nMeanwhile, the Republicans seemed to be dooming themselves. The public soured on the political zeal of Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, especially evident in his complaint over seating arrangements on Air Force One en route with the President to the funeral of assassinated Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin. Then, when the Senate investigation (headed by Senator Alphonse D'Amato of New York) into the economic activities of the Clintons in Arkansas yielded little tangible evidence linking them to any criminal activity, the whole Whitewater investigation looked more and more like a partisan gambit. (This investigation ran parallel to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's Whitewater probe.) Most importantly, the economy had rebounded in the previous five months, allowing Clinton to take credit for low interest rates, a low unemployment rate, and a dramatic decline in the federal budget deficit. Thus, for Clinton, the harmonious August 1996 Democratic convention in Chicago, in which he won renomination without any opposition, was a vindication of his first term and reflected his successful strategy of offering centrist issues to the public.\nOn the Campaign Trail\nAs the campaign unfolded, it looked as though Dole would go down to certain defeat. Clinton offered the public more of the same, including \"McIssues\" such as school uniforms and after-school programs for teenagers, none of which constituted major policy initiatives, but all of which preempted the Republican attempt to portray Democrats as dangerous radicals. Instead, Clinton became the candidate of \"family values\" and successfully won the suburban family vote, especially that of the \"soccer Moms.\" The one negative for Clinton proved less than fatal. Press reports broke a story alleging improper contributions to the President's campaign war chest. The story embarrassed the Democratic campaign but failed to turn public support to Dole. The seventy-three-year-old senator from Kansas had announced his resignation from the Senate to focus on the campaign, and then he barnstormed the country nonstop to demonstrate his energy. While both tactics won him great respect, they did not change the outcome of the election.\nThe Democratic Clinton/Gore ticket won more than twice the number of electoral votes than the Republican Dole/Kemp ticket. Perot captured no electoral votes and garnered less than half of his 1992 popular vote. California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and the Republican strongholds of Florida and Arizona were among the thirty-three states Clinton won. The President failed, however, to win his desired mandate with a popular majority, and thus he remained a minority President. Still, the victory for the \"Comeback Kid\" was especially impressive in view of his predicted demise in 1994.\nAlthough Clinton had won a personal victory, his party remained in deep difficulty. Republicans continued to control the House and Senate, proving that their congressional victory in 1994 had been no fluke. Moreover, Republicans maintained their recent gains in state legislative seats and in governorships, particularly in the South. In 1993, Clinton's first year in office, there had been 30 Democratic governors; that number fell to 17 entering 1997. Moreover, almost all the large states had Republican governors, and the Republicans had achieved parity in a long-time Democratic stronghold: state legislatures. The electorate was about evenly divided in party identification. In the South, a large majority of whites were now firmly aligned with the Republicans. During Clinton's two terms, the President failed to stem the slow but steady disintegration of the New Deal coalition toward a realignment favoring Republicans and independents.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

While the number of people who fall into the coverage gap has declined as more states implemented the expansion, 1.4 million uninsured individuals remain in the coverage gap in the ten states that have not expanded Medicaid.\nLimited Medicaid eligibility in non-expansion states leaves many adults without children, people of color, and those with disabilities without coverage. Most adults in the coverage gap are in working families, though about one in six have a disability that requires ongoing health care and may limit their ability to work. Using data from 2023, this brief estimates the number and characteristics of uninsured individuals in these ten non-expansion states who could gain coverage if Medicaid expansion were adopted.\nThe future of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion is uncertain as Congress considers significant changes to Medicaid financing. Some proposals under consideration would eliminate the enhanced 90 percent federal matching rate for the expansion population or make other changes to federal payments to states for this group. Any cuts in federal funding for expansion enrollees would likely lead a number of states to rollback coverage for this population and would increase the number of people who fall into the coverage gap and become uninsured.\nHow many people are in the coverage gap?\nThe coverage gap exists in states that have not adopted the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Under the ACA, Medicaid was expanded to cover adults ages 19 to 64 with incomes up to 138% FPL (or $21,597 for an individual in 2025). This income threshold applied to parents and to adults without dependent children who were previously not eligible for Medicaid. While the ACA intended to require all states to implement the Medicaid expansion, a 2012 Supreme Court ruling made expansion optional for states. As of February 2025, 41 states, including the District of Columbia, have adopted Medicaid expansion (Figure 1).\nIn the ten states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion, an estimated 1.4 million individuals remain in the coverage gap. These adults have incomes above their state’s Medicaid eligibility threshold but below the poverty level, making them ineligible for ACA Marketplace subsidies (Figure 2). Because the Medicaid expansion was expected to be mandatory for states, the ACA did not provide eligibility for subsidies in the Marketplaces for people below poverty.\nMedicaid eligibility remains limited in states that have not expanded their programs. All non-expansion states, except Wisconsin (which provides coverage through a waiver), do not offer Medicaid to adults without children, regardless of their income (Figure 3). As a result, 80% of the individuals in the coverage group are adults without dependent children.\nUninsured rates in states without Medicaid expansion are nearly twice as high as those in expansion states (14.1% vs. 7.6%). People without insurance have more difficulty accessing care, with almost one in four uninsured adults in 2023 not receiving needed medical treatment due to cost. Uninsured individuals are also less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and treatment for major health conditions and chronic diseases.\nWhat are the characteristics of people in the coverage gap?\nNearly three-quarters of adults in the coverage gap live in just three Southern states. Texas accounts for 42% of individuals in the coverage gap, the highest share of any state, while Florida and Georgia account for an additional 19% and 14%, respectively (Figure 4). Overall, 97% of those in the coverage gap live in the South. Of the 16 states in the region, seven have not adopted Medicaid expansion.\nNearly six in ten people in the coverage gap are in a family with a worker and over four in ten are working themselves. (Figure 5). However, these individuals work in low-wage jobs that leave them below the poverty level and often work for employers that do not offer affordable job-based insurance. Over half (53%) of workers in the coverage gap are in the service, retail, and construction industries, with common jobs including cashiers, cooks, servers, construction laborers, housekeepers, retail salespeople, and janitors. In non-expansion states, even part-time work can make parents ineligible for Medicaid.\nAbout one in six (16%) people in the coverage gap have a functional disability. The share of people in the coverage gap with disabilities increases with age (Figure 6). Over a quarter (26%) of adults ages 55 to 64 in the coverage gap have a disability compared to one in ten adults under age 25. Adults ages 55 to 64, who often face increased health care needs, account for 17% of all people in the coverage gap. Despite these challenges, many of these individuals do not qualify for Medicaid through a disability pathway, leaving them uninsured. Research shows that uninsured people in this age group may delay necessary care until they become eligible for Medicare at 65.\nPeople of color make up a disproportionate share of individuals in the coverage gap. Six in ten people in the coverage gap are people of color, a higher share than among adults in non-expansion states (49%) and nationwide (44%) (Figure 7). These differences in part explain persisting disparities in health insurance coverage across racial and ethnic groups.\nHow many uninsured could gain coverage if all states adopted the Medicaid expansion?\nApproximately 2.7 million uninsured adults would gain coverage if all states adopted Medicaid expansion. This includes 1.4 million people in the coverage gap and 1.3 million uninsured adults with incomes between 100% and 138% of the FPL, most of whom are eligible for Marketplace coverage but not enrolled (Figure 7 and Table 1). While many of these adults above poverty qualify for zero-premium Marketplace plans, Medicaid generally provides more comprehensive benefits with lower out-of-pocket costs. The potential number of people who could gain coverage through expansion varies by state.\nSammy Cervantes, Clea Bell, and Jennifer Tolbert are with KFF. Anthony Damico is an independent consultant.\nAppendix Tables\nData And Methods\nThis analysis uses data from the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS provides socioeconomic and demographic information for the United States population and specific subpopulations. Importantly, the ACS provides detailed data on families and households, which we use to determine income and household composition for ACA eligibility purposes.\nMedicaid and Marketplaces have different rules about household composition and income for eligibility. The ACS questionnaire captures the relationship between each household resident and one household reference person, but not necessarily each individual to all others. Therefore, prior to estimating eligibility, we implement a series of logical rules based on each person’s relationship to that household reference person in order to estimate the person-to-person relationships of all individuals within a respondent household to one another. We then assess income eligibility for both Medicaid and Marketplace subsidies by grouping individuals into household insurance units (HIUs) and calculate HIU income using the rules for each program. For more detail on how we construct person-to-person relationships, aggregate Medicaid and Marketplace households, and then count income, see the detailed Technical Appendix A.\nUndocumented immigrants are ineligible for federally-funded Medicaid and Marketplace coverage. Since ACS data do not directly indicate whether an immigrant is lawfully present, we draw on the methods underlying the 2013 analysis by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and the recommendations made by Van Hook et. Al.1 ,2 This approach uses the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants to develop a model that predicts immigration status for each person in the sample. We apply the model to ACS, controlling to state-level estimates of total undocumented population as well as the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center. For more detail on the immigration imputation used in this analysis, see the Technical Appendix B.\nIndividuals in tax-filing units with access to an affordable offer of Employer-Sponsored Insurance (ESI) are still potentially MAGI-eligible for Medicaid coverage, but they are ineligible for advance premium tax credits in the Health Insurance Exchanges. Since ACS data do not designate policyholders of employment-based coverage nor indicate whether workers hold an offer of ESI, we developed a model that predicts both the policyholder and the offer of ESI based on the Current Population Survey (CPS). Additionally, for families with a Marketplace eligibility level below 250% FPL, we assume any reported worker offer does not meet affordability requirements and therefore does not disqualify the family from Tax Credit eligibility on the Exchanges. For more detail on the offer imputation used in this analysis, see the Technical Appendix C.\nAs of January 2014, Medicaid financial eligibility for most adults ages 19-64 is based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). To determine whether each individual is eligible for Medicaid, we use each state’s reported eligibility levels as of May 2024, updated to reflect 2025 Federal Poverty Levels. Some adults ages 19-64 with incomes above MAGI levels may be eligible for Medicaid through other pathways; however, we only assess eligibility through the MAGI pathway.3\nAn individual’s income is likely to fluctuate throughout the year, impacting his or her eligibility for Medicaid. Our estimates are based on annual income and thus represent a snapshot of the number of people in the coverage gap at a given point in time. Over the course of the year, a larger number of people are likely to move in and out of the coverage gap as their income fluctuates.\nStarting with our estimates of ACA eligibility in 2017, we transferred our core modeling approach from relying on the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the American Community Survey (ACS). ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates as well as longer trend analyses. Since our methodology excludes a small number of individuals whose poverty status could not be determined, our ACS-based population totals appear slightly below CPS-based totals and some ACS population totals published by the Census Bureau. This difference is in large part attributable to students who reside in college dormitories. Comparing the two survey designs, CPS counts more of these individuals in the household of their parent(s) than ACS does.\nTechnical Appendix A: Household Construction\nIn KFF’s estimates of eligibility for ACA coverage, income eligibility for both Medicaid and Marketplace subsidies is assessed by grouping people into “health insurance units” (HIUs) and calculating HIU income according to Medicaid and Marketplace program rules. HIUs group people according to how they are counted for eligibility for health insurance, versus grouping people according to who they live with (e.g., “households”) or are related to (e.g., “families”). HIU construction is an important step in assessing income as a share of the federal poverty line (FPL) because it impacts whose income is counted (and thus the total income for the unit) and how many people share that income (and thus the corresponding FPL to use for comparison, since FPL varies by family size). Our HIUs are designed to match ACA eligibility rules for both Medicaid and Marketplaces. Below we describe how we construct HIUs for this analysis. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nPerson to Person Relationships\nWe construct spousal and parent-to-child person-to-person linkage variables within each household of the microdata. The American Community Survey (ACS) includes only the relationship of each person in a household to one central reference person. Using the household reference person’s known relationships to all other individuals within each household, we iterate through every pair of individuals present in each household to determine probable person to person links for possible mother, father, and spousal pairs. Our approach to determining probable family interrelationship linkages closely follows the construction documented by IPUMS-USA with the notable exception of unmarried partner relationships.4 We intentionally diverge from IPUMS-USA because the presence of an unmarried partner relationship does not impact federal program eligibility. Among individuals designated as married with a spouse present in the household, our constructed spousal pointer matches the IPUMS SPLOC variable 99% of the time in the 2013 microdata. Our construction of mother and father pointers match the IPUMS MOMLOC, POPLOC, MOMLOC2, and POPLOC2 variables for more than 99% of all person-records.\nFamily Aggregation\nSeparate from person-to-person linkage variables, we assemble individual records into family units reproducing the Census Bureau’s Family Poverty Ratio (POVPIP) variable. Although the Census Bureau does not include a unique family identifier on the ACS microdata, we approximate the groupings used to generate the ACS income-to-poverty ratio variable with the following steps:\n- Both non-relatives of the household reference person (RELP of 11-17) and all individuals in non-family households (HHT of 4-7) are categorized as single-person families.\n- Married couples and other family households without subfamilies (PSF of 0) are categorized into single-family households.\n- Married couples and other family households with subfamilies (PSF of 1) are categorized based on their subfamily number (SFN).\nThis family identifier is used in estimating family-wide statistics, such as the percent of the uninsured Americans in a family below poverty or the count of Medicaid-enrollees with one or more workers in their family. This family aggregation matches the groupings used to determine the income-to-poverty ratio variable, and estimates of health insurance presented by family poverty categories align with Census Bureau publications based on the ACS.5 Since many family members obtain health coverage separately from one another (for example, an elderly parent cohabiting with their working-age child might hold Medicare coverage and Employer Sponsored Insurance, respectively), descriptive statistics focused on family attributes rely on this family identifier but Medicaid and Marketplace eligibility determinations do not.\nOverview of KFF-HIUS\nWe construct two different HIUs for everyone in the sample: a Medicaid HIU and a Marketplace HIU. We use two HIUs because the rules for counting families and income differ between the two programs. For example, in Medicaid, children with unmarried parents have both parents’ income counted toward their income, whereas under Marketplace rules, only the income of the parent who claims the child on his/her taxes counts. In another example, certain tax dependents (e.g., a parent) are treated differently for Medicaid eligibility than they are for Marketplace eligibility. To account for these rules, we developed an algorithm for sorting people into HIUs. We construct HIUs and HIU incomes separately for each person in a household and take into account the family relationships and income of the other people in the person’s household. People in the same household or in the same family may not have the same HIU composition or income for determining either Medicaid eligibility or eligibility for tax credits.\nIn simplest terms, the HIU algorithm sorts people into tax filing units. For all people in the data set, the algorithm assesses whether they are likely to be a tax filer themselves and, if so, who they are likely to claim or, if not, who is likely to claim them. It also captures whether someone is neither a tax filer nor claimed as a dependent by someone else. Importantly, the HIU construction considers all relationships for each person within the household. This step is particularly important in correctly classifying people in non-nuclear families (e.g., households with more than one generation, with unmarried partners, or with relatives outside the nuclear family such as an aunt or uncle), which may contain either one or multiple tax filing units.\nIn counting income for both Medicaid and Marketplace HIUs, we use modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), corresponding to the ACA rules. MAGI differs from total income in that some sources of income (e.g., cash assistance payments from TANF or SSI) do not count toward MAGI. We calculate HIU income as a share of poverty using the Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.6\nFor a small number of people, Medicaid HIU income as a share of poverty does not match Marketplace HIU income as a share of poverty due to the different rules between the programs. This analysis first calculates Medicaid HIU and classifies anyone who meets Medicaid eligibility into that category (including most individuals below 138% FPL in the Medicaid expansion states). We then calculate Marketplace HIU; anyone meeting subsidy eligibility is grouped into that category (above Medicaid and also above 100% FPL up to 400% FPL for most individuals). This approach follows the eligibility rules in the ACA, which specify that people are eligible for tax credits only if they are ineligible for Medicaid.\nSteps in Calculating KFF-HIUS\nBefore we group people into HIUs, we first calculate annual MAGI for each respondent. We compare each person’s income to IRS filing requirements for being a tax filer7 and for being a qualifying relative claimed by someone else.8\nWe then group people into HIUs. We begin this process by grouping everyone within a household who is related into “cohabitating families.” Cohabitating families include all family relations; they also include unmarried cohabitating partners and relatives of each cohabitating partner.\nWithin each cohabitating family, we assess whether any individual is eligible to claim any other individual as a tax dependent. People are eligible to claim others as tax dependents if their income is above the IRS filing threshold for a head of household or, if married, for a married couple. People are eligible to be claimed by others if (a) they are a child (under age 19 or, for tax credits, 23 if a full-time student), and someone else in the cohabitating family has at least twice their income, or (b) they are below the limit to be a tax filer, have income below the qualifying relative limit, and someone else in the cohabitating family has at least twice their income. Within each cohabitating family, we assess who is likely to claim whom, using the assumptions that:\n- People who are claimed by others are more likely to be claimed by close relatives (e.g., a parent) than by others (e.g., a grandparent).\n- Married couples (who file) file jointly\n- If more than one person in a cohabitating family is eligible to claim others within that cohabitating family, the wealthiest person claims the eligible dependents.\nOnce we determine who within the cohabitating family is likely to claim each other, we know the HIU size and are able to apply income rules for the HIU. We apply Medicaid and Marketplace rules for whose income counts in calculating Medicaid HIUs and Marketplace HIUs, respectively.9 People who are filers but are not eligible to claim someone else or to be claimed by someone else are an HIU of 1. People who are not filers and are not claimed by filers have their HIU size and income counted according to Medicaid non-filer rules.10\nInflation Factors\nIn order to determine ACA eligibility during calendar year 2023, we compared tax filing unit income against the most current premiums available, for open enrollment 2025.11 We relied on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (ECI), Private Wages and Salaries to inflate the income of each HIU by approximately 8.0% to align 2023 incomes to 2025 premiums.12 Since most state Medicaid eligibility determinations through the MAGI pathway are calculated as a percent of HHS Poverty Guidelines for that year and not a fixed dollar amount, inflation was not necessary to assess the Medicaid eligibility of individuals.\nAfter inflating 2023 tax filing unit incomes to match 2025 premiums, we similarly inflated 2023 IRS thresholds for both filing requirements13 and for qualifying relative tests14 by the same factor so that these thresholds aligned with the inflated income amounts.\nLimitations\nAs with any analysis, there are some limitations to our approach due to the level of detail that we can obtain from available survey data. Key limitations to bear in mind include:\n- We currently are not able to appropriately group anyone who lives outside the household with a household that claims them as a tax dependent. For example, we are not able to connect students living away from home or children with a non-custodial parent with the people who may be claiming them (and whose income should count to their HIU). We are also not able to determine married people who file separately.\n- To group people into tax filing units, we have to make assumptions about how people are likely to file their taxes. We assume that tax filers claim qualifying relatives they are able to claim. We make this assumption based on the fact that Medicaid and Marketplace eligibility rules are determined not by who is actually claimed on the tax return but by who is allowed to be claimed. However, people may sort themselves into different tax filing units than we estimate.\nTechnical Appendix B: Immigration Status Imputation\nTo impute documentation status, we draw on the methods underlying the 2013 analysis by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and the recommendations made by Van Hook et. al..15 ,16 This approach uses the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants to develop a model that predicts immigration status for each person in the sample.17 We apply the model to a second data source, controlling to state-level estimates of total undocumented population as well as the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center.18 Below we describe how we developed the regression model and applied it to the American Community Survey (ACS). We also describe how the model may be applied to other data sets. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nData Sources\nWe used the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants l data to build the regression model. The 2023 Survey of Immigrants dataset contains questions on citizenship and legal status at the person level. The KFF/LA Time Survey of Immigrants19 is a probability-based survey exploring the immigrant experience in the U.S. and draws on three different sampling frames including an address-based sample (ABS), a random digit dial (RDD) sample of pre-paid cell phone numbers, and callbacks to an RDD sample in which the individual did not speak English or Spanish. The survey includes interviews with 3,358 immigrant adults and was offered in ten different languages.\nThe regression model is designed to be applied to other datasets in order to impute legal immigration status in surveys that do not ask about migration status. The code mentioned above includes programming to apply the model to either the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Core files, ACS, or the Current Population Survey (CPS). Because the SIPP Core file contains different survey questions and variable specifications from the ACS and CPS, we create unique regression models to apply the model to each dataset. For the analysis underlying this brief and other KFF estimates of eligibility for ACA coverage, we apply the regression model to the 2013 ACS and then each subsequent year of the ACS.\nDue to underreporting of legal immigration status in survey datasets, in imputing immigration status we control to state and national-level estimates of the total undocumented population and also the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center. Pew reports these estimates for all states and the District of Columbia.20\nConstruction of Regression Model\nWe use the 2023 Survey of Immigrants to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies a respondent as a potential unauthorized immigrant. The dependent variable is constructed based on the following factors:\n- Respondent was not a United States (US) citizen,\n- Respondent did not have permanent resident status or a valid work or student visa, , and\n- Respondent does not have other indicators that imply legal status.21\nWe use the following independent variables to predict unauthorized immigrant status:\n- Year of US entry,\n- Job industry classification,\n- State of residence,\n- Household Income,\n- Ownership or rental of residence,\n- Number of occupants in the household (< or >= six occupants),\n- Whether all household occupants are related,\n- Health insurance coverage status,\n- Sex, and\n- Ethnicity.\nThe regression model was sub-populated to remove respondents who could not be considered unauthorized. People who could not be considered unauthorized include people who are US citizens or have other indicators that imply legal status.\nImputing Unauthorized Immigrants in Other Datasets\nWe use the Pew estimates as targets for the total number of unauthorized immigrants that the imputation generates. We first apply this strategy to the 2013 ACS, which contains health insurance information prior to the ACA’s coverage expansions. We stratify the targets by state and the District of Columbia and by participation in the labor force. We impute immigration status within each of these 102 strata.22\nTo generate the imputed immigration status variable, we first calculated the probability that each person in the dataset was unauthorized based on the 2023 Survey of Immigrants regression model. Next, we isolated the dataset to each individual stratum described above. Within each stratum, we sampled the data using the probability of being unauthorized for each person. After sampling, we summed the person weights until reaching the Pew population estimate for each stratum. The records that fell within the Pew population estimate were considered to be unauthorized immigrants. We repeated the process of sampling using the probability of being unauthorized and subsequently summing the person weights to reach Pew targets five times, creating five different unauthorized variables per record. These five imputed authorization status variables were then incorporated into a standard multiple imputation algorithm, closely matching the imputed variable analysis techniques used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the National Health Interview Survey.23\nWe used this first pass on the ACS 2013 to inform our sampling targets for the latest available microdata (ACS 2023). Looking at the results of our undocumented imputation on the ACS 2013, we calculated the share of undocumented immigrants lacking health insurance within each of those 102 strata prior to the ACA’s coverage expansions and transferred that information into a new dimension of sampling strata for the ACS 2023. We split each of the 102 sampling strata used on the pre-ACA ACS 2013 into uninsured versus insured categories, resulting in 204 sampling strata for subsequent years. We then repeated our imputation on the ACS 2023 with the newly-divided strata, allowing for a small decline in the undocumented uninsured rate based off of the percent drop in the uninsured rate among citizens.24\nTo easily apply the regression model to other data sets, we created a function that applies this approach to a chosen data set. The function first loads the dataset of choice, then standardizes the data to match the independent variables from the 2023 Survey of Immigrants regression model, and finally applies the multiple imputation to generate a variable for legal immigration status.\nTechnical Appendix C: Imputation Of Offer Of Employer-sponsored Insurance\nAn integral part of determining ACA eligibility is assessing whether workers without employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) hold an offer through their workplace that they decline to take up. In most cases, an affordable offer of ESI disqualifies members of the tax filing unit of the worker from receiving subsidized coverage on the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace. The American Community Survey (ACS) does not ask about employer offers of ESI; however, the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) includes questions about whether each worker received an offer of ESI from his or her employer at the time of interview. We use the CPS-ASEC offer of ESI variable to inform a regression-based multiple imputation of whether each tax filing unit constructed in the ACS had at least one offer at work, and also assess affordability for the employee and, separately, for any potential dependents within the unit. Since the health insurance coverage variables available in the CPS-ASEC 2024 capture sources of coverage at any point during calendar year 2023 (versus at the time of survey, as with the offer rate variable), a subset of sampled individuals had a change in their employer-based coverage status across the two distinct time periods.25 Therefore, among workers who potentially experienced a shift in offer status across the two time periods, we recoded or imputed offer rates in 2023 using the offer status in 2024. After constructing this revised offer variable for workers in CPS, we aggregated the results at the tax filing unit level to create a prediction model to apply to the ACS. Below we describe these recodes and imputation. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nRecoding and Imputing Offer Rate Data in the CPS\nAs a first step in our analysis, we divided CPS-ASEC survey respondents into five distinct groups:\n- All individuals who did not work during 2023 and also did not hold an offer of ESI in 2024 were assumed not to have an offer in 2023.\n- All individuals who reported being an ESI policyholder (that is, anyone reporting having taken-up their offer of ESI) during 2023 and also reported holding an offer of ESI during early 2024 were assumed to have an offer in 2023.\n- All workers in 2023 who held their own ESI policies during 2023 but then reported not holding an offer during 2024 were re-coded as holding an offer of ESI in 2023.\n- All non-workers during 2023 who reported holding an offer during 2024 were re-coded as not holding an offer of ESI in 2023.\n- Some workers during 2023 who did not report being ESI policyholders but did report holding an offer of ESI during early 2024 were imputed to not have an offer of ESI during 2023.\nFor many groups, including those in groups (1) and (2) listed above, the offer status did not change across the two time periods. In contrast, we recoded offer status for people in groups (3) and (4): every non-offered worker in group (3), which includes people who held ESI policies in their own name in 2023, were considered to have an offer of ESI in 2023, and offered workers in group (4), which includes people who did not work themselves in 2023, were considered to not have their offer of ESI in 2023. Last, we implemented a probability-based random sample imputation of offers of ESI for people in group (5), described in more detail below. Only a subset of the group was re-coded from holding an offer in 2024 to not holding an offer in 2023.The number of workers selected from this population was equal to the population size of (3) subtracted by the population size of (4), thereby assuming an unchanging offer rate for the total worker population across the period.\nImputing Offer Rates for CPS Respondents with Ambiguous Offer Rate Status\nThe CPS-ASEC worker-level regression model was designed to be applied to a single dataset where ESI offer status is known at one point in time but not another. The code mentioned above includes programming to apply the model to the Current Population Survey (CPS-ASEC) (for years 2014 on). For the analysis underlying KFF’s current estimates of ACA eligibility, we apply the regression model to workers in the 2024 CPS-ASEC.\nWe use the 2024 point-in-time worker offer variable provided by the US Census Bureau26 to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies a respondent as a recipient of an offer of employer-sponsored insurance at his or her workplace in early 2024. The dependent variable was constructed at the worker-level based on individuals not holding their own ESI policy at time of interview and also reporting an ESI offer or eligibility to be covered that was then voluntarily declined.\nWe use the following independent variables to predict offer status in 2023 among workers not covered by their own ESI during both 2023 and early 2024 but potentially holding an offer of ESI in 2023:\n- Any public coverage,\n- Any nongroup coverage,\n- Worker earnings among all jobs,\n- Full-time versus part-time status,\n- Age of worker,\n- Work within the construction industry.\nThe regression model was sub-populated to remove respondents already covered by their own ESI and also to remove non-workers. Since this imputation does not account for the affordability of the offer or whether it meets the minimum value test, we included an assumption that workers in tax filing units with a MAGI below 250% FPL do not hold affordable offers of ESI and therefore might be eligible to purchase subsidized coverage on the Exchanges.27\nAs mentioned above, we assume an unchanging offer rate for the total worker population across the two time periods. We determined the needed size of the population to impute by subtracting the population of (4) from the population of (3) to ensure an equivalent number of offers were gained and lost. This left only workers who reported holding an offer of ESI during early 2024, since (3) represented a larger count of workers than (4). We then calculated the probability that each worker in the dataset was offered ESI during calendar year 2023 based on our 2024 CPS-ASEC regression model. Next, we selected workers within the potential population (5) using the sampling probabilities resultant from our model.\nConstruction and Application of ACS Regression Model\nFor the analysis underlying KFF estimates of ACA eligibility, we construct a prediction model of having an offer of ESI using the 2024 CPS-ASEC and then apply this regression to tax filing units in the 2023 ACS to estimate who has an ESI offer in ACS.\nWe aggregate the worker offer variables constructed the 2024 CPS-ASEC as described above to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies each tax filing unit as either holding or not holding an affordable offer of employer-sponsored insurance.\nWe use the following independent variables to predict offer status among tax filing units:\n- Any senior citizen in the household,\n- Oldest member of the tax-filing unit,\n- Any member of the tax-filing unit has employer-sponsored insurance coverage,\n- Any member of the tax-filing unit has nongroup coverage,\n- Any uninsured individuals in the tax filing unit,\n- Share of adults working full-time and part-time, and\n- Highest worker earnings.\nSince the imputation of documentation status (discussed in Technical Appendix B) required a multiply-imputed approach, this secondary imputation and subsequent worker sampling was only conducted once per implicate, keeping the number of ACS implicates to five.\nEndnotes\n- State Health Access Data Assistance Center. 2013. “State Estimates of the Low-income Uninsured Not Eligible for the ACA Medicaid Expansion.” Issue Brief #35.

We allow the undocumented rate to drop slightly after 2013. We base the percent drop in the uninsured rate among the undocumented on the drop for citizens (half the scale of the drop for citizens) each year until 2023, resulting in the final undocumented uninsured rate of 51% in calendar year 2023. Prior to implementing this new sampling dimension, we found unrealistic drops in the uninsured rate of the undocumented population that we largely attributed to our prediction model’s inability to discern this group from legally-present non-citizens, many of whom are eligible for assistance under the ACA’s coverage expansions. Although a few states have implemented programs that allow for coverage of the undocumented population, these programs are state-funded and relatively small in scale compared to the nationwide coverage expansions accompanying the ACA. ↩︎\n- For example, anyone who did not work during 2023 who then held an offer of ESI in early 2024 would appear incongruous in our CPS-based eligibility model.

During the pandemic, the coverage expansions put in place by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including Medicaid expansion and subsidized Marketplace coverage, served as a safety net for people who experienced economic and coverage disruptions. Gains in Medicaid and Marketplace coverage contributed to significant declines in the uninsured rate through 2022. Although states began the process of unwinding continuous enrollment in Medicaid in April 2023 and resumed disenrolling people from Medicaid, the full effect of Medicaid disenrollments were not felt in 2023. In addition, the enhanced Marketplace subsidies, which were extended through 2025, remained in place. Both these factors contributed to maintaining most of the coverage gains experienced during the pandemic period in 2023.\nThis issue brief describes trends in health coverage in 2023, examines the characteristics of the uninsured population ages 0-64, and summarizes the access and financial implications of not having coverage. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), this analysis examines changes in health coverage from 2022 to 2023 and compares data for 2023 to data for 2019 to report on coverage trends during the pandemic and through the start of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision. Because of disruptions in data collection during the pandemic, the Census Bureau did not release 1-year ACS estimates in 2020. The analysis focuses on coverage among people ages 0-64 since Medicare offers near universal coverage for people ages 65 and older, with just 457,000, or less than 1%, of people over age 65 uninsured.\nKey Takeaways\n- How many people are uninsured: Despite the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision that began in April 2023, the number of people ages 0-64 who were uninsured held steady at 25.3 million in 2023. However, the number of uninsured children increased from 3.8 million in 2022 to 4.0 million in 2023. Compared to 2019, the number of people who were uninsured declined by 3.6 million.\n- Who is uninsured: Most uninsured people are in low-income families and have at least one worker in the family. Reflecting the more limited availability of public coverage in some states, adults ages 19-64 are more likely to be uninsured than children. Despite gains across groups over time, racial and ethnic disparities in coverage persist.\n- Why are people uninsured: Many uninsured people cite the high cost of insurance as the main reason they lack coverage. In 2023, 63% of uninsured adults ages 18-64 said that they were uninsured because the cost of coverage was too high. Many uninsured people do not have access to coverage through a job, and some people, particularly poor adults in states that have not expanded Medicaid, remain ineligible for financial assistance for coverage. Although over half of people who are uninsured may be eligible for Medicaid or subsidized coverage in the Marketplaces, they may not be aware of these coverage options or may face barriers to enrolling. In some cases, even with subsidies, Marketplace coverage may not be affordable.\n- How does not having coverage affect health care access: People without insurance coverage are less likely to access care and more likely to delay or forgo care because of costs. Although difficult to establish direct causality, research has linked Medicaid expansion to improved health outcomes, including lower mortality rates from cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and maternal mortality.\n- What are the financial implications of being uninsured: Uninsured people often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. Nearly half (49%) of uninsured adults say they have difficulty affording health care costs, more than double the share of those with private insurance (21%). These costs can quickly translate into medical debt since most people who are uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings. More than six in ten (62%) uninsured adults report having health care debt compared to over four in ten (44%) insured adults.\nAlthough coverage rates for the overall population ages 0-64 held steady in 2023, future changes to Medicaid and Marketplace coverage could have a significant impact on health coverage. Proposals that would alter how Medicaid is financed or that would impose work requirements on certain adults enrolled in the program would likely lead to a loss of Medicaid coverage. Moreover, the temporary enhanced Marketplace subsidies will expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. Without a permanent extension, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the number of uninsured people will increase by 3.8 million, on average, in each year from 2026 to 2034. The combined Medicaid and Marketplace coverage losses could lead to a sizable increase in the number of people who are uninsured. In turn, the loss of coverage could have implications for access to care and financial stability associated with having health coverage and could lead to a worsening of disparities in health outcomes.\nHow many people are uninsured?\nAmong the population ages 0-64, both the number of uninsured (25.3 million) and the uninsured rate (9.5%) remained at historic lows in 2023. A continued decline in the number of uninsured adults ages 19-64 was offset by an increase in the number of uninsured children. Compared to 2019, prior to the start of the pandemic, the number of uninsured and the uninsured rate for the population ages 0-64 were both significantly lower in 2023. Nearly all groups experienced coverage gains, but American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) and Hispanic people had larger gains than their White counterparts and low-income individuals and those in working families had bigger gains than those at higher incomes and those without a worker in the family.\nKey Details:\n- In 2023, 25.3 million people ages 0 to 64 were uninsured, and the uninsured rate for this population was 9.5%, both statistically unchanged from 2022. While the uninsured rate held steady from 2022, it was lower than in 2019 (10.9%) prior to the start of the coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1).\n- From 2019-2023, the uninsured rate declined by 1.4%, driven primarily by gains in Medicaid and Marketplace coverage because of pandemic-era coverage protections. The Medicaid continuous enrollment provision required states to keep people enrolled in Medicaid during the pandemic in exchange for enhanced federal funding and enhanced ACA Marketplace subsidies, first enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and renewed through 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Although the enhanced Marketplace subsidies remained in effect in 2023, Medicaid continuous enrollment ended on March 31, 2023, and states resumed disenrolling people from Medicaid, though the full effects of the disenrollments were not felt in 2023. During this time period, employer coverage declined by 0.5% (Figure 2).\n- While there was no change in the uninsured rate for the overall population ages 0 to 64 in 2023, the share of children 18 and younger without insurance increased from 5.1% in 2022 to 5.3% in 2023. At the same time, the uninsured rate for adults ages 19 to 64 decreased to 11.1% in 2023 from 11.3% the previous year (Figure 2). An increase in Medicaid coverage for adults 19-64 from 16.3% to 16.5% in 2023 drove the decline in the uninsured rate for this group. Despite the uptick in the uninsured rate for children in 2023, the share of children without health insurance coverage was still lower in 2023 compared to 2019.\n- Although nearly all groups experienced coverage gains during the pandemic-period, they were largest for AIAN and Hispanic people and individuals in low-income families. From 2019 to 2023, the uninsured rate for AIAN people fell 3.0 percentage points (from 21.7% to 18.7%) and the uninsured rate for Hispanic people decreased by 2.1 percentage points (from 20.0% to 17.9%), although these groups remain more likely to be uninsured than their White counterparts. Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) people did not experience a significant decline in the uninsured rate during this period, which may, in part, reflect the smaller sample size for NHPI people, which limits the power to detect statistically significant differences. While the uninsured rate dropped for people at all income levels, individuals in low-income families1 experienced the largest declines. From 2019-2023, the uninsured rate for poor individuals dropped 2.2 percentage points (18.0% to 15.8%) and 2.7 percentage points for individuals with income 100-199% FPL (18.2% to 15.5%, Figure 3).\n- From 2022 to 2023, the uninsured rate for the population ages 0 to 64 fell in six states (Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, North Dakota, and Oregon) but increased in two states, Iowa and Idaho (Appendix Table A). At the same time, the uninsured rate for children increased in six states (Alabama, Idaho, New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington). While these changes occurred in both expansion and non-expansion states, the uninsured rate was lower in expansion states (7.6%) compared to non-expansion states (14.1%) in 2023 (Figure 6).\nWho is uninsured?\nMost of the 25.3 million people ages 0-64 who are uninsured are adults, in working low-income families, and are people of color. Reflecting geographic variation in income and the availability of public coverage, most uninsured people live in the South or West. In addition, most who are uninsured have been without coverage for long periods of time. (See Appendix Table B for detailed data on characteristics of the uninsured population.)\nKey Details:\n- In 2023, of the total uninsured population ages 0 to 64, nearly three in four (73.7%) had at least one full-time worker in their family, and 11.2% had a part-time worker in their family (Figure 4). More than eight in ten (80.9%) uninsured people were in families with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level, and nearly half (46.6%) had incomes below 200% FPL. White people made up 37.1% of the uninsured, and the remaining 62.9% included Hispanic (41.1%), Black (12.5%), and Asian (3.7%) people and people of other racial or ethnic backgrounds (Figure 4). Most uninsured individuals (74.2%) were U.S. citizens, while 25.8% were noncitizens. Almost three-quarters (73.9%) of uninsured people lived in the South or West.\n- Adults ages 19 to 64 are more likely to be uninsured than children. In 2023, the uninsured rate for children was 5.3%, less than half the rate for adults at 11.1%.\n- Uninsured rates in the U.S. still show clear racial and ethnic disparities. In 2023, 17.9% of Hispanic people and 18.7% of AIAN people ages 0 to 64 were uninsured—more than two and a half times the rate for White people (6.5%). Asian individuals had the lowest uninsured rate at 5.8%.\n- Noncitizens are more likely than citizens to be uninsured. Nearly one-third of noncitizen immigrants were uninsured in 2023, while the uninsured rate for U.S.-born citizens was 7.5% and 8.9% for naturalized citizens. (Appendix Table B).\n- Uninsured rates vary by state and by region; individuals living in non-expansion states are more likely to be uninsured (Figure 6). Six of the ten states with the highest uninsured rates in 2023 were non-expansion states (Figure 5 and Appendix Table A).\n- Nearly two-thirds (64%) of people who were uninsured in 2023 have been without coverage for more than a year.2 People who have been without coverage for long periods may be particularly hard to reach through outreach and enrollment efforts.\nWhy are people uninsured?\nLack of access to affordable health coverage is the main reason many people say they are uninsured. A majority of working age adults in the U.S. obtain health insurance through an employer; however, not all workers are offered employer-sponsored coverage or, if offered, can afford their share of the premiums. Medicaid covers many low-income individuals, especially children, but Medicaid eligibility for adults remains limited in most states that have not adopted the ACA expansion. Marketplace subsidies make coverage more affordable for many, but even subsidized Marketplace coverage can be unaffordable for some, and few people can afford to purchase private coverage without financial assistance.\nKey Details:\n- Cost is the most commonly cited reason for being uninsured. In 2023, 63.2% of uninsured adults ages 18-64 said they were uninsured because coverage is not affordable (Figure 7). Other reasons included not being eligible for coverage (27.0%), not needing or wanting coverage (26.6%), and signing up being too difficult (23.9%).\n- Not all workers have access to coverage through their job. In 2023, 64.7% of uninsured workers worked for an employer that did not offer them health benefits.3 Among uninsured workers who are offered coverage by their employers, cost is often a barrier to taking up the offer. From 2014 to 2024, total premiums for family coverage increased by 52%, outpacing wage growth, and the worker’s share increased by 31%.4 Low-income families with employer-based coverage spend a significantly higher share of their income toward premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses compared to those with income above 200% FPL.5 Particularly among people working for small employers , premium contributions for dependents can be unaffordable.\n- Medicaid eligibility varies across states and eligibility for adults is limited in states that have not expanded Medicaid. As of December 2024, 41 states including DC had adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion. Two states implemented the expansion in 2023—South Dakota in July and North Carolina in December. In states that have not expanded Medicaid, the median eligibility level for parents is just 34% FPL and adults without dependent children are ineligible in most cases. Additionally, in non-expansion states, millions of poor uninsured adults fall into a “coverage gap” because they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits.\n- Many lawfully present immigrants must meet a five-year waiting period after receiving qualified immigration status before they can qualify for Medicaid. States have the option to cover eligible children and pregnant people without a waiting period, and as of May 2024, 37 states have elected the option for children and 31 states have taken up the option for pregnant individuals. Lawfully present immigrants, including those who are not eligible for Medicaid because they have not met the five-year waiting period, are eligible for Marketplace tax credits. However, Some states have taken steps to provide fully state-funded coverage to some or all immigrants who are not eligible for federal coverage.\n- Though financial assistance is available under the ACA to many of the remaining uninsured, not everyone who is uninsured is eligible for free or subsidized coverage. Nearly six in ten (14.5 million) uninsured individuals in 2023 were eligible for financial assistance either through Medicaid or through subsidized Marketplace coverage (Figure 8). However, over four in ten uninsured (10.9 million) are outside the reach of the ACA because their state did not expand Medicaid, they have an ineligible immigration status, or they were deemed to have access to an affordable Marketplace plan or offer of employer coverage.\nHow does not having coverage affect health care access?\nHealth insurance makes a difference in whether and when people get necessary medical care, where they get their care, and ultimately, how healthy they are. Uninsured adults are far more likely than those with insurance to postpone health care or forgo it altogether because of concerns over costs. The consequences can be severe, particularly when preventable conditions or chronic diseases go undetected.\nKey Details:\n- Uninsured adults are more likely to forgo needed care than their insured counterparts. In 2023, nearly half (46.6%) of uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 reported not seeing a doctor or health care professional in the past 12 months compared to 15.6% with private insurance and 14.2% with public coverage. Part of the reason for not accessing care among uninsured individuals is that many (42.8%) do not have a regular place to go when they are sick or need medical advice (Figure 9). But cost also plays a role. Over one in five (22.6%) adults without coverage said that they went without needed care in the past year because of cost compared to 5.1% of adults with private coverage and 7.7% of adults with public coverage. A KFF survey that asks about cost barriers for individuals and their family members reports higher percentages of both uninsured and insured people delaying or forgoing needed care due to cost.\n- Uninsured children were also more likely than those with private insurance or public insurance to go without needed care due to cost in 2023 (9.5% compared to 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively). Furthermore, over a quarter (27.4%) of uninsured children had not seen a doctor in the past year, compared to 4.8% of children with public coverage and 3.7% of those with private coverage (Figure 9).\n- Studies repeatedly demonstrate that uninsured individuals are less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and services for major health conditions and chronic diseases.6 ,7 ,8 ,9 Because people without health coverage are less likely than those with insurance to have regular outpatient care, they are more likely to be hospitalized for avoidable health problems and to experience declines in their overall health. When they are hospitalized, uninsured people receive fewer diagnostic and therapeutic services and also have higher mortality rates than those with insurance.10 ,11 ,12 ,13 ,14\n- Research demonstrates that gaining health insurance improves access to health care considerably and diminishes the adverse effects of having been uninsured. A review of research on the effects of the ACA Medicaid expansion finds that expansion led to positive effects on access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population.\n- More recent research generally shows Medicaid expansion is associated with improved health outcomes, although establishing direct causality between health insurance and health outcomes is complex. For example, Medicaid expansion is associated with increased early-stage diagnosis rates for cancer, lower rates of cardiovascular mortality, and increased odds of tobacco cessation.15 ,16 Medicaid expansion has also been linked to lower mortality rates, including those from cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and maternal mortality.17 ,18 Evidence suggests it also aids long-term recovery for substance use disorders and improves treatment management for conditions such as diabetes and HIV.\n- Public hospitals, community clinics and health centers, and local providers that serve underserved communities provide an important health care safety net for uninsured people. However, safety net providers have limited resources and service capacity, and not all uninsured people have geographic access to a safety net provider.19 ,20 ,21 High uninsured rates contribute to rural hospital closures and greater financial challenges for rural hospitals, leaving individuals living in rural areas at an even greater disadvantage to accessing care.22 ,23 Research indicates that Medicaid expansion is associated with reductions in uncompensated care costs and improved financial performance for rural hospitals and other providers.\nWhat are the financial implications of being uninsured?\nUninsured individuals often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. These bills can quickly translate into medical debt since most people who are uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings.\nKey Details:\n- Those without insurance for an entire calendar year pay for almost 40% of their care out-of-pocket.24 In addition, hospitals frequently charge uninsured patients higher rates than those paid by private health insurers and public programs.25 ,26 ,27 ,28\n- Uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 are much more likely than their insured counterparts to lack confidence in their ability to afford usual medical costs. Nearly half (49%) of uninsured adults said they or a family member had problems paying for health care compared to 21% of insured adults, and over eight in ten (84%) uninsured adults said they worried that health care costs would put them in debt or increase their existing debt, compared to 71% of adults with insurance (Figure 10).\n- Unaffordable medical bills can lead to medical debt, particularly for uninsured adults. More than six in ten (62%) uninsured adults report having health care debt compared to over four in ten (44%) insured adults. Uninsured adults are more likely to face negative consequences due to health care debt, such as using up savings, having difficulty paying other living expenses, or borrowing money.29 ,30 ,31\n- While federal and state laws require certain hospitals to provide some level of charity care, not all eligible patients benefit from these programs. Consequently, charity care costs represent a small share of operating expenses at many hospitals.\n- Research suggests that gaining health coverage improves the affordability of care and financial security among the low-income population. Multiple studies of the ACA found declines in trouble paying medical bills and reductions in medical debt in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. More recent research found that Medicaid expansion decreased catastrophic health expenditures and was associated with greater increases in income among low-income individuals.\nAppendix\nSupplemental Tables\nEndnotes\n- The Federal Poverty Level was $ 24,526 for a family of three in 2023. ↩︎\n- Cohen RA and Sohi IS. “Demographic Variation in Health Insurance Coverage: United States, 2023”, National Center for Health Statistics.
