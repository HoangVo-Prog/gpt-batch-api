Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object. The json object must have exactly the following keys:\n    - \"statement\": repeat the input statement text.\n    - \"speaker\": the speaker name.\n    - \"context\": the context text.\n    - \"label\": one of the six labels: \"TRUE\", \"mostly-true\", \"half-true\", \"barely-true\", \"FALSE\", or \"pants-fire\".\n    - \"justification\": a short explanation that cites evidence from the search results.\n\n    Return only this json object and nothing else.\n\n    The field \"Search Results\" below contains text snippets extracted from the top Google Search results related to the statement.

B., in a dispute of his confession made during a North Carolina theft investigation.[152] Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that \"This case presents the question whether the age of a child subjected to police questioning is relevant to the custody analysis of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). It is beyond dispute that children will often feel bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the same circumstances would feel free to leave. Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that commonsense reality, we hold that a child's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis.\"\n- On March 19, because of the continuing attacks on Libyan rebels by Gaddafi forces, there was a military intervention authorized under UNSCR 1973.

The ruling involves the class-action status of a sex discrimination case against Wal-mart containing 1.6 million litigants. The court ruled in favor of Wal-mart, only on the class action status of the dispute of the women's claims. The ruling rejects the lower courts lowering of standards in class-action status certification.[156][157] Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia said that \"We are presented with one of the most expansive class actions ever. The District Court and the Court of Appeals approved the certification of a class comprising about one and a half million plaintiffs, current and former female employees of petitioner Wal-Mart who allege that the discretion exercised by their local supervisors over pay and promotion matters violates Title VII by discriminating against women. In addition to injunctive and declaratory relief, the plaintiffs seek an award of backpay.

The ruling involves the US$1.6 billion estate of J. Howard Marshall Jr. between Anna Nicole Smith and Pierce Marshall. The court ruled in favor of the estate of the deceased Pierce Marshall and the Texas Probate Court versus the estate of the deceased Vickie Lynn Marshall (a.k.a. Anna Nicole Smith) and the California Bankruptcy Court.[162] Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said that \"... the Texas state decision controlled, after concluding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked the authority to enter final judgment on a counter claim that Vickie brought against Pierce in her bankruptcy proceeding. 1 To determine whether the Court of Appeals was correct in that regard, we must resolve two issues: (1) whether the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority under 28 U. S. C. §157(b) to issue a final judgment on Vickie's counterclaim; and (2) if so, whether conferring that authority on the Bankruptcy Court is constitutional ... We conclude that, although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter judgment on Vickie's counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional authority to do so.\"\n- June 24\n- New York becomes the sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage.[163]\n- Pixar Animation Studios' twelfth feature film, Cars 2, the sequel to 2006's Cars, is released in theaters.\n- June 27\n- The U.S. Supreme Court makes a 7–2 decision that strikes down a California law enacted in 2005 that bans the sale of certain violent video games to children without parental supervision. The Court upholds the lower court decisions and revokes the law, ruling that video games were protected speech under the First Amendment as other forms of media. The ruling involves a freedom of speech case by The Entertainment Merchants Association against a California law. The court ruled in favor of The Entertainment Merchants Association, only on the overly broad status of the statute's wording of the minors' rights.[164][165] Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia said that \"We consider whether a California law imposing restrictions on violent video games comports with the First Amendment...Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny—that is, unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 395. The State must specifically identify an \"actual problem\" in need of solving, Playboy, 529 U. S., at 822–823, and the curtailment of free speech must be actually necessary to the solution, see R. A. V., supra, at 395. That is a demanding standard. \"It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.\" Playboy, supra, at 818. California cannot meet that standard...And finally, the Act's purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive. Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who care whether they purchase violent video games.\"\n- Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich is found guilty of 17 of the 20 counts against him, including trying to sell President Barack Obama's Senate seat.[citation needed]\n- June 28\n- In baseball, a judge in the U.S. state of Delaware authorizes the Los Angeles Dodgers to enter into a $150 million bankruptcy financing deal after the club addresses concerns of Major League Baseball.[166]\n- Richard Poplawski is sentenced to death in the murder of three Pittsburgh police officers in April 2009.\n- June 29 –Transformers: Dark of the Moon is released in theaters as the third film in the Transformers film series.\nJuly\n[edit]- July 1\n- The New York Times sexual assault case against former International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn is on the verge of collapse due to concerns over the credibility of the alleged victim's testimony.[167] A judge releases him from house arrest as prosecutors said that the maid had made false statements.[168][169]\n- Owners in the North American National Basketball Association start a lock out after failing to reach a new collective bargaining agreement.[citation needed]\n- The Minnesota government shuts down after budget talks fail between Democratic governor Mark Dayton and the Republican-controlled Minnesota Legislature.[170][171][172]\n- According to a 2012 U.S. Census Bureau estimate, for the first time, the majority of children under one year old are minorities.[173]\n- Leon Panetta is sworn in as the new Secretary of Defense, succeeding Robert Gates.[174]\n- July 2 – ExxonMobil workers attempt to contain an oil spill on the Yellowstone River in the U.S. state of Montana.[citation needed]\n- July 3 – A tourist boat sinks in the Gulf of California off the coast of Baja California in Mexico with 23 people missing.[175][176]\n- July 5\n- The US city of Phoenix, Arizona is hit by a large dust storm leaving thousands of people without power and grounding flights at Phoenix Airport.[177][178]\n- Casey Anthony is found not guilty of first degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her daughter Caylee, but found guilty of four misdemeanor counts of giving false information to police.[179]\n- July 7\n- The U.S. Supreme Court makes a controversial 5–4 decision that Humberto Leal García, a Mexican national, should be executed in the US state of Texas despite concerns over whether the circumstances of his execution would breach international law.[180][181]\n- Casey Anthony is sentenced to four years for lying to law enforcement regarding the death of her child Caylee in the U.S. state of Florida but after credit for time served, will be released on July 17.[182]\n- Seven people are shot dead by Rodrick Dantzler in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[183]\n- July 8 – STS-135: In an added flight, Space Shuttle Atlantis of the U.S. Space Shuttle program is launched for its final time.

The Supreme Court denied Vernor's petition for certiorari – the action affirms the lower court of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale it was, in fact, not a \"sale with restrictions on use\", giving rise to no right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The Ninth Circuit's decision means that the policy considerations involved in the case might affect motion pictures and libraries as well as sales of used software.

{"custom_id": "3_extracted-4825.json", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "gpt-5", "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert in detecting and analyzing fake news. Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object. The json object must have exactly the following keys:\n    - \"statement\": repeat the input statement text.\n    - \"speaker\": the speaker name.\n    - \"context\": the context text.\n    - \"label\": one of the six labels: \"TRUE\", \"mostly-true\", \"half-true\", \"barely-true\", \"FALSE\", or \"pants-fire\".\n    - \"justification\": a short explanation that cites evidence from the search results.\n\n    Return only this json object and nothing else.\n\n    The field \"Search Results\" below contains text snippets extracted from the top Google Search results related to the statement. These snippets are partial web page texts returned by search. Use them as factual evidence to support your evaluation. If fewer than three snippets are provided, use whatever is available.\n\n    \tStatement: House Republicans are ramming through legislation ... to classify pizza as a vegetable for the purpose of school lunches.\n        Subject(s): education,public-health\n        Speaker: democratic-national-committee\n        Speaker's Job Title: \n        State Info: \n        Party Affiliation: none\n        Barely-True: 8\n        False: 2\n        Half-True: 10\n        Mostly-True: 8\n        Pants-Fire: 0\n        Context: an e-mail message\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        -\nhttps://clinton.presidentiallibraries.us/files/original/bff2844763dc3584e752a34161c9bbeb.pdf\n4f5a91d45bb7a5deb409c859300910aa\nPDF Text\nText\nFOIA Number:\n2006-0885-F\nFOIA\nMARKER\nThis is not a textual record.

The Republican leaders are'\n.desperately trying to find something\nthey can offer to satisfy the North\nDakotans. .Whether they succeed or\nnot. it will have nothing to do with\nactually balancing the budget.\nIf this sounds like the triumph of\npolitics over subsiance, it is. The\ndebate over the balanced-budget\namendment is now and always has\nbeen almost entirely a question of\npolitical positioning. Republicans and Democrats alike\ngenuinely believe-ihat the Federal\n• deficit threatens the economic future of the. next generation and that\nthe budget should be put on a direct\npath toward.balance. But that is not\ntheir highest pnority.\nFor most Republicans, low taxes\narc more important. This is why\nevery Republican in the Senate and\nHouse voted in 1993 against President Clinton's five-year plan to lower\nthe deficit by $500 billion by reducing\nspending and raising taxes. And it is\n'why Republicans in the House of\nRepresentatives are determined to\nCommued on Page BS, Column 5\nAs a practical matter, if the Social\nSecurity surplus is disregarded, balancing the budget by 2002, as the\nconstitutional amendment would\ntheoretically require, would be near\nimpossible.\nIncluding the surplus, the Congressional Budget Office has calculated, it would require some combination of spending reductions and\ntax increases totaling $1.2 trillion to\nbring Federal expenditures in line\nwith Federal receipts in seven years.\nThe advocates of the constitutional\namendment have not offered a clue\nas to how they intend to bridge that\ngap.\nThe current surplus of Social Security revenue over payments is so\nlarge that if this money were excluded from the calculation^, another\n$636 billion would be needed to balance the budget by 2002, an amount\nfar beyond what even the most ardent budget slashers can find.\nTo entice Senators Conrad and\nDorgan, the Republicans have suggested that they could agree to exclude Social Security from the deficit\ncalculations required by the coristitulional amendment sometime early\nin the next century.\nThat is what the Democrats fear\nmost. According to current reckoning, the Social Security system will\nbegin running a deficit in 2013. Presumably some steps will be taken\nbetween now and then to rectify the\nproblem. But if not, there are only\ntwo possibilities: Social Security retirement payments will have to be\nabandoned, or the Government will\nBoth sides see\nan impending\neconomic crisis\nfor the next\ngeneration.\nhave to borrow to finance them.\nAs for the Republicans, they continue to maintain that they have no\nintention of reducing Social Security\nbenefits. Maybe not. But they also\nsay they will balance the budget\nwithout raising taxes or cutting military spending. Hardly anyone who\nhas run the numbers believes all\nthose promises can be kept.\nAs if all this were not confusing\nenough, the balanced-budget amendment was further complicated. on\nTuesday when, in an effort to peel off\na couple of Democratic votes, Republicans agreed to this stipulation\nthat Federal courts would have no\njurisdiction to enforce the amendment.\nSo what would happen if the time\nfor balancing the budget arrived.and\nthe ledger w a s still out of whack?\nWell, said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of\nUtah, the Republican floor leader,\nthe political,pressure would be such\nthat Congress would act to close the\ngap. .\nThat was as close as anyone in .the.\nSenate has come this week to ac-^\nknowledging that politics is what the\nwhole debate is about.\n\"<\no\nS3\n•\ntn\nC\nO\na\n;\nc\nS3\nl/>\ns\nI\n30\nO\n•a\n/ .•\n�1\nBALANCED BUDGET ;\n•'•' Late today, Mr. .

It was easy to understand\nwhy Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, fell that he could nol\nafford lo let the amendment go down\nto defeat on Tuesday night, when he\ntook the extraordinary step of postponing the long-expected vote.\nThe balanced-budget amendment\nis, of course, the centerpiece of the\nRepublican Congressional agenda\nand a powerful cause at the grass\nroots. It is also the first high-profile\nlegislation Mr. Dole has shepherded\nthrough Ihe newly Republican Sen-\nThe Republicans continued their\nquest into.the night for the final, 67th\nvote necessary to send the amendment to the stale legislatures for\nratification. But their agonizing impasse at 66 favorable votes raised\nthe possibility that they had simply\npushed too hard and too long, aniagomzing the Democrats in the middle\nthat they needed to woo, and creatinp problems for themselves in managing the Senate in the future.\nate as a contender for his party's\n1996 Presidential nomination.\nFor the Democrats, a majority of\nwhom opposed the amendment, the\nequally chilling fear was of winning\na legislative victory on Thursday\nwhile creating a nightmarish issue\nfor the next campaign; Bill Mclntui lf. a top Republican pollster, assericd lhal every Democrat who\nNobody expected it to be as easy in\nthe Senate as it was in the House.\nRepublicans mounted a-tough and\ntighily coordinated campaign: they\naired\ntelevision\ncommercials\nagainst wavering Democrats, muscled down Democratic amendments,\nand kept their own troops rigidly in\nA place where the\nmajority must nod\nto the minority.\nO\nS\nDIARY\nw\nZ\nHi\nDevelopments in Washington\nSENATE Still looking (or |ust one more vote to win passage, Senate ReDunicans agreed to a showdown today on the balanced budget\namendment. The vote is scheduled for 2 P.M., and the Republican maloni, leader. Bob Dole, pledged that it it failed, he would revive the issue al the height of the 1996 election campaign. He attacked several\nDemocratic opponents for what he called a \"stunning flipflop\" on a\nmeasure they voted for a year ago, and other Republican senators criticized President Clinton's opposition, as well. On Tuesday, Mr. Dole\nsuddenly postponed ihe vote on the amendment when it became clear\nthat he had just 66 of the 67 votes needed. The decision to have the fi-,\nnai vole today came alter apparently unsuccessful attempts to reach a\ncompromise that would-keep Social Security trust funds off limits to\nbudget cullers There is no reason a balanced budget-amendment\ncoma nol pass with nearly 80 votes in a matter of a few mjnutes — if\nthey're willing lo prolecl Social Security,\" said Senator Harry Reid. a\nNevada Democrat\n1 he latest New York Times/CBS News Poll found that 79 percent of\nAmericans said they favored a constitutional amendment that would require the Federal Government to balance the budget 2002, but only 32\npercent said they were in favor if it would require cuts in Social Security\nHOUSE Under intense pressure from Republican governors. House Republican leaders partly reversed themselves and agreed to let some\nstates use Federal food stamp money to feed poor people in any way\nmat state officials wanted Under the agreement, Ihe states could set\ntheir own eligibility criteria and benefit levels, replacing the uniform national standards in the food stamp program. Low-income people now\"\nreceiving food stamps would not necessarily be entitled to food assistance under the new programs. The agreement represents the second\nmajor change on the issue by House Republican leaders in less than a\nweek\nThe House-passed Ihe Regulatory Reform and Relief Act. a noncontro- .\nversial portion of the Republican agenda for regulatory change. It is intended to make regulations affecting small businesses more flexible\nThe VO'E: '•'••as 415 lo 15 .\nline. Even today, Haley Barbour,\nchairman of the Republican National Committee, was visiting the last\nRepublican holdout against the\namendment, Senator Mark 0. Hatfield of Oregon, pleading for his support for \"a must piece of legislation.\nfor the Republican Party,\" according to Mr. Hatfield. (The Oregon\nRepublican said he did not relent.)\nBut Democrats asserted that Mr.\nDole crossed the line when he stalled .\nthe proceedings on Tuesday night —\n— and warned that he will pay in the\nfixture. At issue was the kind of\nagreement that is widely used by\nparty leaders in the Senate to set\nforth a rough schedule for debating\nand voting on legislation; in this\ncase, Democrats had agreed for a\nseries of voles on their amendments\non Feb. 28, followed by a vole on the\noverall constitutional amendment itself.\nThe Senate Parliamentarian noted\nthat the agreement did not specify\nthat the main vole would come immediately on Tuesday night without\nany intervening business. But Democrats cried foul. \" I thought that a\ndeal was a deal,\" said Senator Tom\nDaschle, ihe Democratic leader. \" I\nthought that our word was our\nbond.\" Analysts said that without the\nunderstanding that such agreements\nwould be honored, it would be veryhard to get much done in the Senate.\n\"They are central and indispensible,\" said Ross K. Baker, a scholar\non the Senate at Rutgers University.\nThis fallout carries real danger\nfor Mr. Dole: a majority can get\nthings done in a bitterly partisan\nHouse; it can get blocked at every\nturn in a bitterly partisan Senate.\n1\nDemocrats, for their part, faced\ndangers of their own. If they win the\nlegislative struggle on Thursday,\nthanks in part to the parliamentary\nskills of Senator Robert C. Byrd,\nthey could still lose the political war.\nSome Republicans, in fact, argue\nthat their party can'only profit by\nDemocrats blocking legislation that\nis supported by three-fourths of the\nAmerican people.\nThat explained the careful positioning under way in a series of news\nconferences today, when Democrats\nmade the point again and again that\nthey do not oppose balancing the\nbudget, only balancing it with a bad\nly flawed amendment that puts Social Security at risk.\nMr. Byrd spoke with great disdain\nthis week of a world ruled by \"talk\nshows, public opinion polls, bumpersticker slogans and a so-called political Contract With America.\" But\nDemocrats with more unsettled\nseats than Mr. Byrd's were paying\nattention to the polls. In fact, Republicans appear to have calculated that\nthis apprehension, in the end, would\nturn the final Democrats to their\ncause.\nIf this week showed anything,\nthough, it showed thai simple political calculations are a poor predictor\nof the United States Senate.\n1\n�t: •'\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES, THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1995\nTHESPEAKER\nUrging Students to Read With a Little Cash\nSince then, several people around\nthe country have started similar programs.

Interest rates on 28-day treasury\ncertificates fell 9.3 percentage\npoints, to 49.7 percent, suggesting\nsome modest relief from Mexico's\nsoaring interest rates.\nInterviews with several Govern-,\nment officials and statements by the\nBank of Mexico indicate that the\nZedillo administration was persuaded by the nation's business leaders\nand bankers to drop its original plan\nto let the peso float freely and instead simply to adjust its rate downward by 15 percent against the dollar.\nBefore this, the peso was worth\nnearly 29 cents. The devaluation, on\nthe first day of the crisis brought it\nto just above 25 cents. Today, the\npeso is worth less than 17 cents.\nThe Bank of Mexico, the central\nbank, acknowledged that the Government's Exchange Rate Commission decided on Dec. 19 that Mexico\nhad no choice but to abandon a fixed\nexchange rate because its international reserves had dropped below\n$11 billion; which was considered insufficient to fight off an attack by\ncurrency speculators. The reserves\nhave since been reinforced by an\ninternational rescue package that includes $20 billion in American loans\nand guarantees.\nMembers of Mr. Zedillo's Govern- .\nment confirmed that the businessmen opposed any floating exchange\nrate at the meeting on Dec 20.\n\"We went to them with the idea of\na floating rate and they got absolute- •\nly scared,\", said one Government\nofficial, referring to the business\nleaders and bankers. \"But eventual-,\nly they convinced us that a free float\nwasn't the right way to go.\"\nOnce the Bank of Mexico had disclosed to the bankers and businessmen that it lacked; sufficient reserves to protect the peso, many\nwent out after the meeting to convert\npesos into dollars. By the evening of Dec. 21, the Government Exchange\nRate Commission was forced: to let\nthe peso float freely.\nMany American investors have\ncomplained that the Mexican Government had either wittingly or unwittingly given Mexican investors\ninside information about currency\nreserves that allowed them to safeguard their positions before the peso's fixed exchange rate, was abandoned. Mr.\" Salinas's remarks appear to corroborate their suspicions.\nLuis R. Luis, head of research for\nScudder,,Stevens & Clark of Boston,\nsaid that so much money left Mexico\nin those two days of December that\nit \"weakened the last hope the central bank had of having a fixed peso\npolicy.\"\nBut Mr, Luis did not believe that\nthe economic crisis, which has cost\nMexico hundreds of thousands of\nJobs and lowered almost everyone's\nstandard of living/ was caused solely\nby the mistakes made in December.\n\"The seeds for the crisis,\" Mr.\nLuis said; \"were planted much earlier.\"\n�%\n'v\nSalinas's Accused Brother: Mexico Searches for a Motive •\nchose as his successor.\n\"\"-.''\n.

But nonbelievers view revaluation as a recipe for disaster. For unless foreign\ninvestors are miraculously inspired to flood Mexico with dollars, the crunch on Ihe supply of money\nas pesos are exchanged at the central bank for\nforeign currency would cut deep into consumption\nand invest ment.\n' . Wages and prices would eventually fall, easing\nthe. Cash crunch, making Mexican exporis competitive and putting Mexicans back to: work. Or\nmaybe nol: A long, bitter recession would surely\ntempt the ruling party's old guard to play the\nnationalism card, jettisoning the economic and\npolitical reforms that have given Mexico a shot at\njoining the affluent industrial world.\nSupply-side recipe: restore\nMexico's old exchange rate.\nW\nITH the wounded Mexican peso trading\nat roughly six to the dollar, why are\ninfluential Congressional Republicans\nstill talking about a return to the pre-crisis exchange rate of 3.5 pesos to the dollar?\nA plausible explanation is that the talk is a\n- political freebie, a way to capitalize on the Whitie\nHouse's embarrassment over the collapse of the\npeso without appearing to sabotage efforts to\n, cope with Mexico's financial meltdown. But like\n|;many ideas from \"supply side\" conservatives,\n• there is just enough common sense to give a life of\ni its own to the notion that currency devaluation\n; ;only worsens badly managed economies.\n.; Mexico apparently got into trouble because its\n• Government did not respond to investors' loss of\n; confidence in the economy last year after the\n; Chiapas revolt. Indeed, Ihe Salinas administra: lion concealed the fact that Mexico's central bank\n'. was spending billions of dollars a month last fall\nlo prop up the peso while failing to prevent the\nsurging growth of the domestic money supply.\nThe dam burst when the ceniral bank ran out of\n. foreign currency to buy back the pesos it had been\nbusily pumping into the economy to keep interest\nrates down and business booming. The exchange\n, value of the peso has since fallen by almost half.\nreducing living standards in an economy accus. lomed to cheap imports and leaving businesses\n; thai owed money in dollars near ruin:\nMainstream economists, including many with\n. impeccable conservative credentials, view depreciation of the peso as pari of the solution. If\ninflation can be kept in check — a.big \" i f \" — they\nargue Ihat Ihe new exchange rale will make\nMexican exporis more competitive, as well as\n: making Mexican securities more attractive to\n3'\ns:\n, Ninilaf Asdu\nforeigners. The supply-siders' alternative, using\nMexico's new line of credit from the United Stales\nTreasury and the Internationa) Monetary Fund to\nrestore the old exchange rate, is seen by Steve\nHanke of Johns Hopkins Univeriity as \"complete\nmadness\" — and the very opposite of prudent\npolicy.\nBut that has not stopped prominent Republicans including Jack Kemp and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, from wondering out loud why\nMexico cannot be held to its old promises never lo\ndevalue. Nor has it stopped Jude Wanniski, the\ndoyen of supply-side ideologues, from labeling\ndevaluation as \"a nitwit idea that comes deep\nfrom the heart of Keynesian philosophy.\"\nMr. Wanniski argues Ihat devaluation is a\nbreach pf trust with the Mexican middle class,\nundermining both their savings and confidence in\nfree markets. And he dismisses efforts lo make\nexports cheaper by depreciating Ihe currency as\na failed nostrum lhal leads to inflalion and more\ndepreciation. His solution for Mexico (and oiher\ncountries bullied by \"the evil death star known as\nthe International Monetary Fund\") is lo lei il\nclaw its way back to the pre-crisis exchange rale.\nWhile mainstream economists are thus uniled\nin the opposition to revaluation of the peso, they\ndon't agree on much else. Mr. Hanke argues Ihat\nthe most plausible way . to restore the peso's\ncredibility is to put monetary policy on automatic\npilot. He favors the creation of a \"currency\nboard\" Ihat would exchange the peso for dollars\nat a fixed rate to all comers — and lack the power\nto bail out either the Goviemtnent budget or the\nbanking system.\nThis approach worked in Europe's colonies in\nthe 19th century, he says. And il is now working in\nArgentina, allowing that nation to shed a centuryold reputation for currency-mismanagement.\nWhy not try the same in Mexico?\nJeffrey Sachs, an economist at Harvard, concedes lhal currency boards are a plausible last\nresori, but argues that the idea of pulling the peso\nin a ''straitjacket\" is premature. Carefully modulated austerity combined with a new honesty and\niransparcncy in currency mailers, he says, could\ndo the job with less pain.\nHe had betlcr be right. For Ihat is plainly the\ndirection the While House is pushing Mexico, and\nCongress is not about lo provide the cash for yet\nanother rescue allnmpl.\n3\nin\ns\nI\nO\n�{'\n';\n...\n'I.\n\\ ..\nI'.\n,.·\n., .\n./\"\n·\n.....\n..\n,'I\n'•·:\n'\n. ·~~ .,\n.'\n.\n'\n,\n\"\n,I\n.\n. t·'\n•\nTIMES, .THURSDAY; .M~RtJ.rLJ~Ps·\nTHE NEW· YORK\n}•\n~ !\n<l\n'\n•\n'\n.\n'.,l\n,.\nI\n•\n','\n',:1\nI\n~\n'\n··.·.\n0\nI'\n,.

Yeltsin has\nst ned a series of decrees intended\nir increase fiscal discipline and red :e widespread corruption, Russi n officials said today.\nThe monetary fund is in the last\nst go of negotiating a $6.2 billion\nsi ndby loan Ihat is contingent on\nN iscow's commitment to stabilize\nit economy and keep its budget defici within agreed limits in an effort\nt(| rut inflation here.\n[ because Russia's 1995 budget\nhi ges on the loan, the fund and\ne< momic reformers within the Govei iment have unusual leverage over\npi icy. Even once the loan is granted\ntl fund will insist on disbursing the\nn mey in installments — the first of\nw ich could arrive in April — and\nt j rig them to Moscow's perform-\nance, Western diplomats said.\nThe decrees give Mr. Yeltsin unprecedented control over Governmem spending and tax exemptions,\nsuggesting a new commitment to\nself-discipline by the President, who\nin Ihe past has signed budget-busting\ndecrees favoring special interests.\nNow much will depend on the degree of compliance with Mr. Yeltsin's decrees, on ihe ability of Government reformers to influence Mr.\nYeltsin over lime, and on Mr. Yeltsin's own ability to say no to powerful friends and lobbies.\nThe decrees are intended to help\nRussia keep its budget deficit tp less\nthan 8 percent of its gross domestic\nproduct. The swelling of (he deficit in\n1994, when ihe Government broke its\npromises to restrain spending, produced inflation (his January alone of\n17.8 percent.\nReduced spending in ihe last\nmonths of 1994 has led (o an estimated inflation rate in February of 13\npercent, First Deputy Prime Minister Anaioly B. Chubais, the Government's senior reformer, said today.\nInflalion is expected to drop again in\nMarch and April, but to remain far\nabove the 3 percent a month goal\nthai Ihe Government had promised\nto reach by the enfl of 1994.\nThe decrees, as announced today\nby Mr. Chubais and Aleksandr Y.\nLivshits, a presidential adviser, affect all spending not mandated in the\n1995 budget passed by Parliament.\nIn effect, the decrees will allow Mr.\nYeltsin and a credit commission that\nincludes Mr. Chubais to oversee\nspending decisions made by other\nparls of the Government like Ihe\nSecurity Council — expenditures\nthai often come as unpleasant surprises to the Finance Ministry.\nThe decrees should also help undercut, though by no means eliminate, the rampant favoritism, corruption and heavy lobbying by interesi groups lhal have distorted gov-\nernance here. One decree restricts\nto Mr. Yeltsin's conlrol widespread\nspecial tax and customs exemptions,\nwhich have been a major source of\ncorruption.\nernniL-ni to further reduce Ihe number of prices regulated by the stale,\na source of easy Corruption. Mr. Chubais said the amount of gross domeslie product subject to stale prices\nshould drop from the currenl 24 perAn earlier presidential decree, for cent to about 16 percent. The idea is\ninstance, had exempted the National to regulate those prices set mostly\nSports Fund from paying customs by stale monopolies, to prevent\nduties, excise taxes and value-added them from making unjustified price\ntax on all goods that helped athletes rises.\nparticipate internationally.

Listyev, 38, made his reputalio in the glasnost period when he\nofi n sparred on the air with Mikhail\nS. iorbachev, the Soviet President,\nwh i was striving to remove the\nstifling cloak of official lies that\nsurrounded everything here.\nijlr. Listyev had recently been\nnnftied executive director of the reorganized Oslankino television netwofk, a job with major financial\nresponsibilities. He supported a ban\nen .advertising on the channel that\nwafc announced on Feb. 20 and due to\nln ^in April 1, There was immediate\nsporulalion tonight lhal Mr. Listyev,\nwhj) was shot in the heart and died\ninsjantly, was killed, over profits,\nndfl journalism.\nAleksandr Yakovlev, a former PolitWiro member under Mr. Gorbachev and chairman of the board of\nthfl}channel, told the Itar-Tass news\nagency tonight that he himself had\nbegun receiving telephone threats\nafter the decision to stop, showing\nadvertisements. \" We must \"have got\nin someone's way,\" Mr. Yakovlev\nsaid, expressing shock at Mr. Listyev's killing.\nMr. .Yakovlev said that Russian\npublic television recently changed\nits methods of selling advertisements, creating an in-house agency\nthat multiplied the company's advertising revenues seven times,\nfrom $1.1 million a month to $7.8\nmillion.\n\"The difference must have ended\nup in the pockets of some moguls,\"\nMr. Yakovlev said. \"•\nBut then the company decided to\nsuspend showing advertising altogether.\nMr. Listyev was one of three\npeople behind the hard-hilling news\nprogram, Vzglyad, - or Viewpoint.\nMore recently, he was the- host of\nChas Pik, or Rush Hour, an interview show modeled on CNN's Larry\nKing Live.\nThe last several months brought\nmany changes to Ostankino. the biggest stale television channel that\nre.iches across Ihe entire former So-\nBanning public TV\nadvertising may have\ncreated enemies.\nviet Union. Last November, President Boris N. Yeltsin made Ostankino Channel One into Russian public television, but the state kept a\ncontrpllftig 51-percent share.\nThe remaining shares were offered to a select group of companies\nincluding Itar-Tass, Aeroflot International Airlines and commercial\nbanks including Menatep, Stolichny,\nInkombank and Roscredit.\nBecause of its widespread influence, who controls Russian public\ntelevision\" is considered crucial to\nwinning the parliamentary elections\nscheduled for December and the\npresidenlial vote scheduled for June\n1996. Mr. Yakovlev has spoken in the\npast of intense political pressure,\nsaying: \"Unfortunately, people\nthink that to take the Kremlin, they\nmust first take Ostankino.\"\nIgor Shabdrasulov, a Government\nrepresentative on the board, said the\nban on advertising was intended \"to\ndetermine the proper correlation between advertising on the one hand\nand the interests of economic development and moral criteria on the\nother.\" He said that during Ihe ban,\nlosses would be offset by private\nshareholders.\nThe day after the ban was announced, Mr. Yeltsin announced a\nnationwide ban on advertising tobacco and alcohol products and ads\nfor popular faith healers. But enforcement is likely to be difficult.\nAnatoly Lysenko, director-general\nof Ihe state-owned Russian Radio\nand Television Company, or Channel\n2, warned against the ban, saying\nthat advertising accounts for a third\nof revenue, and companies like Ostankino would be hard-pressed to\ncome up with the lost money.\nTohight, Channel 2 began its newscast with a moment of silence for\nMr. Listyev, with the anchor breaking the silence to ask: \"Who.will be\nnext?\"\n5\ncn\nin\na:\nc\n2\na:\n3\n�THE NEW YORK TIMES, THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1995\nI.M.F. Loan Is Expected for Ukraine\nBy PAUL LEWIS\nIn a development that could have\nimportant implications for economic\nchange in neighboring Russia,\nUkraine is expected to borrow close\nto $1.5 billion from the.International\nMonetary Fund later this month.\nUkraine's representative at the'\nI.M.F. in Washington, Oleh Havryly. shyn, and Anders Aslund, a Swedish\neconomic adviser to President Leonid Kuchma of, Ukraine, confirmed\nin separate interviews, yesterday\nthat the Ukranian, Government\nwould sign a letter this week accepting the l.M.F.'s terms for the loan,\nwhich would be by far the largest the\ninstitution has given any country of\nthe former Soviet Union. Ukraine, a\ncountry of 52 million people, is sand\nwiched between Russia, Poland and\nthe Black Sea.\nThe confirmations came after Mr.\nKuchma announced yesterday the\nresignation of Prime Minister Vitaly\nMasol, a holdover from the, Soviet\nera, and replaced him with. First\nDeputy Prime Minister Yevhen\nMarchuk! who is widely considered\nto be more sympathetic to the President's efforts to create a free-enterprise economy in Ukraine.\n\"This is the beginning of a big\nsurge forward in Ukraine,\" Mr. Havrylyshyn said.\nMr. Aslund, who said the l.M.F.'s\n:\nFrom a $1.5 billion\npact, new pressure\non Russia.\nexecutive board was likely to give\nformal approval to the loan later this\nmonth, described it as \"a stamp of\ninternational approval for Ukraine's\neffort to transform its economy.\"\nHe added that Ukraine had al-.\nready privatized 11,000 state-owned'\nenterprises and planned to sell an\nadditional 8,000 large and mediumsized companies this year. He said it\nhad also cut its inflation rate from\n10,200 percent in 1993 to about 1percent a month and had reducfc'the\nbudget deficit to the equivalent of 5\npercent of the economy's output.\nIn a further show of support for\nMr. Kuchma and his economic policies, the l.M.F.'s managing director,\nMichel Camdessus, will visit Kiev,\nthe capital, next week, officials said.\nThe immediate purpose of the new\nI.M.F. credit is to help Ukraine gather about $6 billion in foreign economic assistance this , year to finance\neconomic development.\nMr. Aslund said he hoped to raise\nthe rest of the money by persuading\nRussia to reschedule $2.5 billion in\nUkrainian debts that come due this\nyear for imports of oil and natural\ngas and to get money from the World\nBank, the United States, Western\nEurope and Japan.\nBut he warned that Ukraine's success in borrowing from the I.M.F.\nmight'make Russia — which is still\nnegotiating for a much larger $6.5\nbillion I.M.F. credit — reluctant to\nreschedule the debts that Ukraine\nowes it. \"The Russians will ask why\nthey should help.Ukraine when they\nare not getting I.M.F. help but\nUkraine is,\" he said.\nMr. Aslund also criticized the Europeans for slowness in assisting\nUkraine, saying that although Germany and the Netherlands were\nsympathetic, France, Italy and\nSpain were more interested in aiding\nAlgeria and other Arab countries of\nNorth Africa in a struggle against\nIslamic fundamentalism.\nHowever,' I.M.F. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said\nthey were reasonably conf ident that\nthey could successfully conclude\ntheir loan negotiations with the Russians within the next few weeks, so\nthat both Russia and Ukraine would\nget their assistance at about the\nsame time.\nMr. Camdessus has already made\ntentative plans to visit. Moscow at\nthe end of the month in anticipation\nof such an agreement, these officials\nsaid.\nThese officials and some private\nexperts also suggest that granting\nUkraine: its loan now will put extra\npressure on Russian ministries, to\ncompromise and accept the l.M.F.'s\nterms. The big stumbling block, they\nsay, is the reluctance of the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Economic Relations to surrender their\ncontrol over Russian oil exports, as\nthe I.M.F. is demanding.\n\"When other branches of the Russian Government see Ukraine is getting I.M.F. money, they will put extra pressure on them to stop blocking the deal,\" said Donald Green, a\nRussian expert with Plan Econ, a\nWashington economic consultancy\nfirm that specializes in the former\nCommunist world.\nIn fact, Mr Green said, the I.M.F.\nis already effectively helping Russia\nby lending to Ukraine and some other parts of the former Soviet Union\nbecause these countries spend much\nof the money buying oil, gas and\nother raw materials from Russia.\n�v •\nclear where police loyalties lay.:T<>\nday the police and gunmen, seemed\nio bel6ng to the faction, of general\nAidid one of the: most powerful clan\nleaders in the country,.'but in. the\npreceding -days rival,'clans' >vere\nfighting near the airport\n.. _ ,\nAt 3 P M G\"eneraliAidid arrived at\nthe airport:^escorted by;six,:iechni-.\ncals, to survey his new. domain.

Two years ago\nand one beach away, 26,000 Americans troops waded aishore in a televised spectacular meant to\nsymbolize a. new humanitarian vocation for the\nUnited States military after the end of the cold war.\nNobody wants to talk about that symbolism\nnow. Somalia, including the'death of 30 Americans,\nhas become a cautionary example of a mercy\nmission gone wrong, cited mainly by those who\nwould keep Americans out of future peacekeeping.\nThe story of international intervention in Somalia is not as negative as conventional wisdom holds.\nYes, with the departure of the last U.N. troops;\nanarchy and civil war are quickly returning. Idealistic assumptions, ill-conceived expansion of the\nmission and fatal confusions over command and\ncontrol marred military operations. They cost the\nlives of 100 peacekeepers and several hundred\nSomalis as the focus shifted from delivering food to\nhunting.down Gen..Mohammed Farah Aidid.\nBut this time, the fighting has not engulfed the\nfood supply, so it is unlikely the deadly starvation\nthat inspired international action 'will'soon, return.\nSome 350,000 Somalis died of hunger before President Bush sent the first American troops in Decern- ,\nber 1992. Perhaps 250,000 more were saved by the\nAmericans and the U.N. forces that followed.\nLessons need to be learned'from the many\nmistakes made by Washington and the United Na-\ntions. But the painful Somalia experience warrants\ntempered pride, not shame. The appropriate conclusion, is to proceed with greater caution in future\nhumanitarian emergencies.\nAmericans want to help when they see people\nstarving. It is a human impulse. Sometimes soldiers\ncan and should provide the help. But the need for\nsoldiers instead of relief workers usually means the\nhumanitarian crisis cannot be solved without subduing military conflict first.\nBefore political leaders send troops into these\nsituations, they need to analyze the risks, define a\nmission that can be accomplished at acceptable\ncosts and then honestly explain the decision to the\nAmerican people and seek Congressional approval.\nNone of that ground was adequately covered for the\nSomalia operation by the Bush Administration,\nwhich launched it, or the Clinton Administration,\nwhich expanded it. American mistakes were compounded by.U.N. Secretary General Boutros Ghali,\nwho allowed the U.N. to become embroiled in local\nclan feuds, compromising its neutrality.\nThe worst errors were made by the U.N. Security Council. With the enthusiastic participation of\nthe United States, it hastily converted a food deliv•ery operation into an ambitious and ultimately\nfutile exercise in nation-building, coupled with a\nsearchand-destroy war against General Aidid.\nBlame for the mistakes of Somalia can be\nwidely shared. But so can credit for the larger good\nthat was done, and now seems all but forgotten.\n:\nMr, Rubin's Sensible Bank Reform\nThe timing was atrocious — coming the same\nweek that reckless trades by a junior employee\nbankrupted the oldest investment bank in Britain.\nYet the regulatory relaxation proposed as a banking reform by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin\nmakes good sense..\nMr. Rubin would wipe away rules dating back\nto the Depression that are unsuited for modern\nfinancial markets. He would allow banks to join\nforces with insurance and securities companies, ,\ncreating a competitive mix that should benefit\ncustomers. The plan would, by diversifying investment opportunities, make banks less risky. — the\nbest way to avoid a taxpayer-financed bailout of\ndepositors. Had banks been allowed to sell insurance and stock, they would not have been bankrupted by the collapse of real estate markets in the\nigso's. •\nCongress forbade banks to sell insurance or\nsecurities in part because it believed that such\nactivities contributed to bankruptcies during the\nDepression. But history and logic suggest Congress\nshould change direction..\nStudies by Prof. George Benston of Emory\nUniversity have shown; that securities activities did\nnot contribute to bank failures in the IQSO's; nor did\nbanks exploit unwitting customers by, for example,\nselling them shares of stock in weak compianies that\nowed the bank money.\nIn recent decades, banks have lost customers\n. as depositors flocked to mutual funds and corporate\nborrowers tapped financial markets directly. By\npermitting affiliation with insurance and brokerage\nfirms, Mr. Rubin would allow banks to find new\ncustomers and, thereby, stabilize revenues. The\n•proposal would protect insured deposits by requiring banks to maintain large reserves and requiring\nregulators to intervene once those reserves dip\nbelow pre-set levels.\nOther reform bills — by Chairman Jim Leach\nof the House Banking Committee and Chairman\nAlfonse D'Amato of the Seriate Banking Committee\n— would take Federal law in the same direction.\nThe bills propose different legal structures and\nsafeguards against misuse of insured deposits.\nSome of these differences are important — for\nexample, Mr. Leach would, indefensibly, insulate\ninsurance agents from competition by banks. Others are petty'— such as ttirf battles over.which\nregulatory agency would reign supreme.\nThe importam point is that for the first time\nkey Congressional committees and the Clinton Administration are pulling in the same direction. That\nwill make it harder for insurance or'Securities\nlobbies to scuttle reform. Nailing down a compromise should not prove difficult if, as the Republican\nagenda unfolds, Congress can keep its mind on this\nvitally important, if unglamorous, topic.\n�THE NEW YORK TIMES, THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1995\nyk Gender-Neutral Tragedy\nLast October an F-14A Tomcat warplane pilots into combat roles prematurely.

Painful as.\nsome of the contemplated cuts are, still more cuts\nare coming, or higher'fares, or both, probably\nbefore year's end. All concerned — City Hall,. Albany and the transit agency's parent, the Metropolitan\nTransportation Authority — need to agree on a new\noverall plan for the next several years, rather than\nripping the system apart mile by mile.\nThe immediate plan has the M.T.A.'s go-ahead\nfor everything but the proposed cuts in service,\nwhich must go through public hearings. The Transit\nAuthority sensibly seeks the biggest savings from\ntrimming bureaucracy .and increasing productivity.\nLess than one-fifth of the total would come from\nreduced bus and subway service, mostly at night or\non lightly used or duplicative routes.\nIt makes sense to cut service during the hours\nwhen it is least used and, as proposed/ to shut a\nsubway station with ohly.94 paying customers a day\nand five times that many fare-beaters. Indeed,\nthere are other stations that could be shut, where\nthe next nearest station is close by. But any such\nmove is politically incendiary; it needs support\nfrom City Hall and Albany.\nThe M.T.A. says the propdsed service cuts\nwould affect only 36,000 of the five million daily\nrides on city buses and sybways; alternative routes\nwould be available, just less convenient, But these\ncuts need the close examination they will get in\npublic hearings. The affected riders are typically\nthe poor, transit cuts hamper their access to jobs\nand schools.\nNew York City sustains 24-hour public transit\nservice unmatched anywhere else. That is one of the\nglories of the city, but within the framework of overall rethinking, there may be room to cut back.\nTransit subsidies are shrinking. There will be less\ncity and state aid, and almost surely less Federal\naid.\nA fare hike should probably be the last resort.\nSome further cuts in service can be handled. Still\nother, less painful remedies are available if other\ngovernmental entities cooperate. Millions could be\nsaved if Washington set less rigid rules for accommodating disabled riders, for conducting largescale random drug testing of employees and for\nbuying American products. It could also benefit if\nAlbany would let the M.T.A. transfer subsidy money\namong its several subdivisions, which also include\ncommuter railroads, bridges and tunnels.\nOne key to the system's gradual recovery from\npast neglect has been its ability to plan ahead, to\nknow how much money there would be and allocate\nil more than a year in advance. The new savings are\nonly a stopgap. Given today's tighter conditions,\nNew York City's transit network needs a new plai..\n�More Money, Not Less\nAo the Editor:\nY 'The Return of Ketchup\" (editorial, Feb. 24), on Repubiican efforts to\nreform Federal food and nutrition\ni programs as pari of bur welfare\nreform proposal, is so inaccurate 1\ncan only conclude thai-it was written\nwithout reading the legislaiioh:\nj take a.back seat to no one in my\ncommitment to child nutrition.

If the mefirst, corporate-cultural sleaziness\nof high leverage and lightning-fast\nshuffling continues to grow, the business of investment banking will gain\na stigma that will shame its practitioners and turn away its customers.\nNext, in overseeing banking and\nsecurities, global exchanges and national regulators need to draw a line\nbetween legitimate risk and reckless\nendangerment.\nThat means getting the Bank for\nInternational Settlements in Basle,\nSwitzerland (central bank for the G10), to sit down with the International Organization of Securities Commissions in Montreal to plan now to\navert a world financial crisis.\nWorking with the exchanges and\nreporting services, these too-sleepy\nbureaucracies could help set standards for managerial monitoring,\npublic disclosure, leverage and\nfirewalls in the interconnected marketplace.

MARCH 2,199J\nPresident,\nDole Divide\nOver Policy\nEmphasis Differs\nOnU.S. World Role\nBy Ann Devroy\na\nt\nWashington Post Stiff Writer\nPresident Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole (RKan.) sketched out competing visions of American foreign policy yesterday, with Dole accusing Democrats of failing to grasp grim global\nrealities and Clinton stemly warning\nof the dangers of \"a new American\nisolationism.\"\nDole, who is seeking the GOP\npresidential nomination and whose\nlong tenure in the Senate has given\nhim more foreign policy experience\nthan the other declared candidates,\nwas clearly partisan, particularly in\nhis attacks on the administration's\nRussia policies. Clinton, speaking\nfrom the same podium only hours\nlater, was presidential and named no\nnames in his references to \"hypo\ncrites\" and isolationists.\nThat was left to White House officials, who earlier said the president\nhad Republicans in mind, particularly\nin the House, when he complained of\na failure to accept, promote and pay\nfor American leadership in the\nworld.\nDole, in remarks built around the\ntheme of \"global realities\" that the\nUnited States must see clearly with\na \"new vision,\" sharply questioned\nthe administration's \"misguided devotion' to Russian President Boris\nYeltsin. He accused it of having a\n\"Russia first\" attitude and chipped\naway at Clinton policies toward Iran,\nIraq, North Korea and on a string of\nother fronts.\nAlthough congressional Republicans have begun drawing lines with\nthe Clinton administration over foreign policy, particularly United Nations peacekeeping operations and\nforeign aid, Dole's address was the\nfirst from a senior party leader and a\n1996 presidential candidate broadly\nto critique the administration's foreign policies. Of the two Republican\nSMPOUCT,A13,COL1\nPOLICY, From Al\npresidential candidates who have\nformally announced, Sen. Phil\nGramm (Tex.) and former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, foreign policy has barely rated a paragraph in their announcement\nThe setting for Clinton and Dole\nyesterday was a conference at the\nNixon Center for Peace and Freedom on \"Defining An American Role\nin an Uncertain World.\" Clinton\nstruck what historically has been a\npresidential theme of the need for\nAmerican leadership and resistance\nto the impulse by Americans to withdraw from that burden.\n• In a barely concealed reference to\nRepublicans, Clinton said the \"new\nisolationists\" would \"eliminate any\nmeaningful role for the United Nations . . . would deny resources to\npeacekeepers and even to our\ntional leader of the reform movement there. U.S. disagreements\nwith Yeltsin, he said, have been\nmade clear.\nClinton used the administration's\nnuclear nonproliferation efforts as\nthe prime example of the need and\nrewards of engagement abroad.\nClinton's speech coincided with the\nstart of an administration push to\nwin an indefinite extension of the 25year-old nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (MPT) at a 172-nation conference that opens in New York next\nmonth.\nTo underscore his commitment to\ncurb nuclear weaponry, the president announced that the United\nStates would remove 200 tons of\nbomb-building material—enriched\nuranium and plutonium—from its\nnuclear stockpiles.\nDole ignored the peacekeeping\nand other immediate battles with\nCongress to concentrate on how\nAmerica should respond to \"a resurgent Russia, asserting its position\naround the globe.\" And even though\nseveral members of the defeated\nBush administration team sat stoically in the audience, Dole did not flinch\nfrom criticizing the Russia policy of\nthe former president.\n\"Just as it was wrong to place too\nmuch focus on [then-Soviet president Mikhail] Gorbachev in 1991, it\nis wrong in 1995 to ignore the fact\nthat President Yeltsin has made serious errors, has moved toward authoritarian rule and has lost the political support of virtually all\nreform-minded Russians,\" Dole said.\nDole has shown consistency in having criticized former President Bush\nfor embracing Gorbachev too closely,\nand now in criticizing Clinton for embracing Yeltsin too closely.\nToday Russia's foreign policy. Dole\nsaid, \"is often in conflict with American interests.\" Yet Clinton, captive of\na \"misguided devotion to a Russia\nfirst policy, which has turned into a\nYeltsin firat policy\" runs an administration that has \"excused, ignored and\nminimized\" Yeltsin's errors, he said.\nReading the lines as if they were an\nindictment. Dole accused Russia of\nmeddling in the U.S.-North Korean\nnuclear agreement, of threatening\nprospective new East European members of NATO whose entry it opposed, of continuing to support Fidel\nCastro in Cuba, and of subverting and\nintimidatingformerSoviet states in\nRussia's so-called \"near abroad.\"\nThe United States, Dole suggested, has looked the other way and\nfailed vigorously to protest, resulting\nin a loss of a \"tremendous opportunity\" to make dear American objections. In the case of Russia's military\naction in Chechnya, Washington failed\nto act \"before thousands were slaughtered,\" he said.\nDole said a \"new realism\" with Russia means not a return to the Cold\nWar but to developing a more honest\nrelationship \"that does not paper over\nimportant policy differences with an\nappeal to personal ties.\"\nBeyond Russia, Dole listed a string\nof other \"globalrealities\"he said the\nUnited States must face, including the\nreality that traditional nuclear nonproliferation efforts sometimes fail\nIraq, Iran and North Korea, he said,\n\"illustrate the failures\" of traditional\ntreaties. He said the nuclear deal the\nUnited States is trying to work with\nNorth Korea \"has little prospect of\nsuccessfully addressing\" the threat;\nsaid a \"cash-hungry Russia\" will give\nIran a leap forward in its nuclear problem; and accused the administration of\n\"timidity\" in dealing with Iraq.\nAlthough\ncongressional\nRepublicans have\nbegun drawing lines\nwith the\nadministration over\nforeign policy,\nVolets address was\nthefirstbroad\ncritique by a senior\nparty official.\n*\ntroops, and squander them on Star\nWars. And they would refuse aid to\nfledgling democracies.\" House Republican leaders have pushed legislation on all those fronts.\n\"New isolationists, some of them\nbeing hypocritical, say we must\ntrumpet the rhetoric of American\nstrength but then argue against the\nresources we need to bring stability\nto the Persian Gulf, restore democracy to Haiti, control the spread of\ndrugs and organized crime, and\nmeet our most elemental obligations\nto United Nations peacekeeping,\"\nClinton said.\n1 \"We must not let therippleof isolationism they have generated build\ninto a tidal wave,\" the president added. \"If we withdrawfromthe world\ntoday, we will have to contend with\nthe consequences of our neglect tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.\nNational Security Adviser Anthony Lake, in a briefing earlier in the\nday, said Clinton's references to isolationism go to House GOP efforts to\ncut severely U.S. contributions to\nU.N. peacekeeping and put restrictions on how the president can use\nU.S. forces, in additional peacekeeping efforts.

The\nFourth Amendment protects people\nfrom unreasonable searches or seizures; it requires police who believe\ncriminal activity is underway to first\nobtain an arrest or search warrant\nBut, overall, yesterday's ruling\nwas narrow, and a majority of the\njustices expressed concerns about\nsafeguards in an en of nationwide\ncomputerized arrest records.\nThe police, of course, are entitled\nto enjoy the substantial advantages\nthis technology confers,\" Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in a statement concurring in the decision.\nThey may not however, rdy on it\nblindly.

The\ncourt has been sharply divided over\ngovernment aid to rehgious entities.\nSome of the more conservative\njustices have said the court should\nreconsider its standards for determining whether a government policy\nunconstitutionally advances religion.\nThey want the court to allow more\ninteraction between government and\nreligious interests, a position that\ncould end up meaning more taxpayer\nsupport, including school vouchers,\nfor church groups.\nThe case began when Ronald W.\nRosenberger of Great Falls and other students were denied funds for\ntheir \"Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia.\"\nThe legal dilemma comes down to\ntwo questions: Whether the Constitution's guarantee offreespeech requires the university to provide student activity funds to religious\nmagazines as it does for nonreligious\npublications and whether the Establishment Clause bars the university\nfrom doing i t\nJeffries, a law professor at the university, said, There is a long tradition in this country offinancialdisengagement between church and\nstate.\" He stressed the university\nwas \"not picking out a rehgious point\nof view and trying to suppress it.\"\nRather, he said, the university was\nmaking basic funding choices. He\nnoted the policy also refuses to subsidize political advocacy. He said student fees may not be used for lobbying or electioneering.\nBut Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\nsaid he did not think those political\nactivities could be compared with\n\"abstract views\" of religion. Kennedy and Justice Antonin Scalia particularly pressed Jeffries on whether a\nreligious activity, or mere viewpoint,\nwas being quashed.\nJeffries said the magazine engaged in \"proselytizing.\"\nJustice David H. Souter suggested\nit would be difficult for universities\nto differentiate between religious\ngroups that merely express rehgious\nviewpoints and those that are more\nactivist Souter seemed to resist the\nidea that public funds should pay for\na religiously oriented magazine.\nJeffries acknowledged the Supreme Court in 1993 had said public\nschools must allow church groups\naccess to empty classrooms on the\nsame basis as nonchurch groups, but\nhe added, \"there cannot be arightof\naccess to the budget.\"\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said\nshe knew of no case allowing direct\npayment to a religious group. But\nScalia asked Jeffries if there was \"a\nmajor step\" between giving access to\na classroom and giving the money to'\nrent one: \"Is that the step off the\ncliff?\" Jeffries said yes.\nMcConnell, a University of Chicago law professor, told the court the\nuniversity should not be in the position of deciding among views students may express.\nThey say they are funding educational activities by students,\" Justice.\nStephen G.

The maneuver left\nthe facility unguarded by international troops for the first time since\nU.S. Marines came ashore in December 1992 to combat Somalia's\ncivil war-generated famine.\nAs if on cue, hundreds of looters\nswarmed onto the airport, scavenging pipes and light fixtures, U.N.\nfurniture and used tires.\nWithin minutes, however, an armada of Aideed's technicals burst\nthrough the airport gates in a melee\nof gunfire that sent U.S. and Italian\ntroops scurrying for cover behind\nsandbag fortifications on the dune\nline.\n\"It's a bad day to be tall,\" Sgt.\nMaj.

There is no substitution\nfor the nationalrecognitionof excellence. . . . If the endowment did not exist today, you would have to invent it\"\nBoth Alexander and Sheldon Hackney, chairman cf the National Endowment for the Humanities, appeared yesterday before the Senate's Interior\nappropriations subcommittee. The\nhearing was a preliminary step toward\napproval of a budget forfiscal1996, and\nChainnan Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) pre:\ndieted that the process wouldn't be\ncompletedformonths. He also warned\nthat agencies under the committee's jurisdiction would have to \"compete\" for\ntheir share of a dwindling pool cf funds.\nThreatened, said Hackney, would be\nthe NEH's historic-preservation projects and teacher institutes.\nLast week a House appropriations\nsubcommittee sliced $5 million from\neach of the endowments' budgets for\nthe currentfiscalyear. The arts endowment was targeted for areductkmerf $1\nmillion in administrative expenses and\n$4 million for individual fellowships.\nIf thoseredsionmeasures are approved, Alexander said, the staff will\nhave to be furloughed for eight days.\nShe added that the unspent funds for\ntheremaindercf the year didn't include $4 million for individual fellowships and that if the endowment must\nmakereductionsin grants, she would\nprefer cutting across the board.\nBut yesterday's hearing veered far\nfrom the subject of appropriations and\ntook on a range of topics, including the\nvalue of regional arts centers, Thomas\nJefferson and political correctness,\nGeorge Washington and history standards and eStism.\nTrying to bhmt charges of cultural\nelitism that have been leveled at the\nendowments, Hackney said: \"I recognize that many people confuse the\nNEH with the NEA, or think that the\nNEH is part of the Humane Society, or\nthat we are somehow involved in humanitarianism. High-profile we are not\nWe are the blue-collar workers of the\ncultural world.\"\nBecause the arts endowment has\nbeen plagued by a political uproar over\nvarious individual grants—and resultant reductions in the agency's budget—Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) demanded to know what reforms had\nbeen introduced to prevent the awarding of questionable grants in the future.\nAlexander described accountability\nmeasures, saying the agency is now receiving interim reports on what projects are being sponsored by organizations with NEA money. \"It sounds\nbetter,\" said Stevens.\n�> 1.\nTHE WASHINGTON POST^\nTHIRSDAV, MARCH\n2,1995\nMARY McGRORY\nA Day of Cloakroom and Dagger\nTimes poll laid it out graphically.\nhe real action on the balanced\nSeventy-nine percent favor a balanced\nbudget amendment took place\nbudget.

Ralph\nRegula (R-Ohio) is warning gallery officials in\nadvance not to airbrush over evidence that it's\nfailing to protect the nation's art treasures.\nLast year, the gallery asked an independent team\nof experts from the Association of Higher Education\nFacilities Officers to assess the safety and security\nof its collection, which includes more than 75,000\nworks of art rangingfromPicasso to van Gogh.\nAlthough, the gallery grumbles at the broad brush\nreview, the evaluation team was \"unanimous in its\nopinion that the conditions of the facilities and the\norganizational problems\" at the gallery \"threaten\nthe security of the collection,\" according to a copy of\nassociation's report. \"If I were them, I would\naddress the issue in my opening statement,\" Regula\ntold our associate Ed Henry. \"And if they don't,\nwe're certainly going to get to it in our\nquestions\nYou can't ignore the concerns\nexpressed in the report.\"\nAt a time when the new Congress is scrutinizing,\narts funding, President Clinton wants to boost the\ngallery's $55 million budget. But Regula, who holds\nthe gallery's purse strings, revealed that the report\nis coloring his early impressions.\n\"We want to know what's happening to the money\nbecause they've been getting a substantial sum\nthrough the budget process plus they have a lot of\nprivate endowment,\" said Regula. Last month, he\nsliced from this year's budget over $400,000 the\ngallery wanted to use to start building a\nmultimillion-dollar sculpture garden.\n\"I think before we start investing in [the garden],\nlet's take care of what we have,\" Regula said of the\ngallery's irreplaceable artwork.\nThe association, a respected nonprofit\norganization, completed the scathing evaluation last\nSeptember. It charged that the gallery's skylights\nand roof \"leak extensively,\" allowing water to seep\ninto the gallery's East and West buildings. The\nbuildings' heating and cooling system was assailed\nforfrequenttemperature and humidity malfunctions\nthat \"could easily exceed poorly trained workers'\nabilities\" to bring the problem under control before\nit damages priceless artwork. Even though the\nA\ngallery commissioned the group's services, gallery\nspokeswoman Ruth Kaplan says the report is\n\"misleading\" because it did not take into view\ncorrective measures that were already combating\nthe problems.\nIn fact, the report noted that \"these conditions\nare recognized by [gallery] staff and plans exist for\ntheir correction.\" But the report added: \"The team\nwishes to state emphatically that steps should be\nundertaken immediately to correct these\ndeficiencies before disaster occurs.\"\nSix months later, the gallery has not taken those\nimmediate steps. Kaplan told us that all of the\nskylights in the modern East Building will be\nreseated by the middle of April, but she confirmed\nthat the building suffered a water leak just last\nmonth after a snowstorm in Washington. There was\nno damage, but 35 paintings were moved to\ntemporary storage as a precautionary measure.\nMeanwhile, a four-year renovation of the\nskylights in the old West Building will not even\nbegin until June 1996. Thanks to a $2 million grant\nfrom the Department of Energy, the gallery vrill\nalso receive a state-of-the-art building automation\nsystem for heating and cooling. But the installation\nwon't start until June and will take more than two\nyears. Malfunctions may relate more to the staff\nthan to the system. The report charged that the\nbuildings' mechanical systems are operated in a\n\"by-the-seat-of-the-pants manner\" and that\ntemperatures in the gallery swing wildly from too\nhot to too cold.\nThe recent selection of retired Air Force Gen.\nMichael P.C. Cams to be the new CIA director\nsurprised no one more than the head of the\npresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.\nFormer defense secretary Les Aspin was\nappointed last year to oversee the 12-member\nboard, which was essentially created to spy on the\nspooks and evaluate the performance of the $28\nbillion-a-year intelligence community. But Aspin has\ncomplained to friends that he had no early\nintelligence about Cams's nomination.\nSue days before the White House announcement,\nAspin spoke to President Clinton and White House\nChief of Staff Leon E. Panetta—and at that point\nCams's name was not even on the \"short list,\"\naccording to sources close to Aspin.\n�THE WASHINGTON POST\nTHIUSDAY, MABCH 2,1995\nFor the Record\n\"O t H F R R e X P A M U P Y Zr From remarks by Sen.

Everyone's\nlooking to you.\nSen. Conrad: Well, my principal concern is that we not loot the Social Security trust fund surplus in order to\nbalance the budget. As I said last\nnight, only in Washington would people think they're balancing the budget\nwhen they're taking trust fund monies,\nretirement fund monies and using it to\nbalance the operating expenses of the\ngovernment....\nQ: Now, a member of your own party, Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana today said, \"Wait a second, Congress\nisn't going to touch that.\" I mean, realistically speaking, Congress won't\ntouch that\nA:... If you read the plain language\nof the amendment, it is very clear that\nthe Social Security trust fund surpluses, in the next seven years—$636 billion—will be used, every penny of it.\nThere won't be a trust fund. It will be\ngone. It will be spent to help balance\nthe operating expenses of the government . . . I think that's wrong....\nAnother very serious concern . . . is\nin the case of economic emergency.\nFor example, we know now the right\npolicy is to balance the budget, to cut\nspending, get this deficit down. But\nthat was exactly the wrong policy 60\nyears ago in the midst of the Depression. Then, raising taxes and cutting\nspending to balance the budget were\nprecisely the wrong options. So, I\nthink we need to have special provision in the case of economic emergency so that we don't put the country\nat risk.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\n'Conflict of Interest'\nIn the Student Loan Program\nIn opposing President Clinton's\nmoney-saving reforms of the student\nloan program [\"Clinton, GOP Split\nOver Student Loans,\" front page,\nFeb. 14|, USA Croup argues that it\nsupports the \"competition\" in the current \"private-public partnership.\"\nIronically, the only things \"private\nsector\" about USA Group are its salaries.\nAs a guarantor responsible for\nhelping to oversee banks' roles in the\nstudent loan program, USAG has no\nprivate investors or contributors.

SCHUSSHEIM\nPresiistlt\nFrfemhofSl. Eluatetlu\nWashington\n�THE WASHINGTON POST\nTHIUSDAY. MARCH\n2,1993\nEdward V. Regan\nCreative Underwriting\nOne d the most frequently voiced arguments in\nfavor of the balanced budget amendment is that 48\nof the states have a balanced budget requirement—35 of them constitutional, 13 statutory—so\nif they can bve with it, why not the federal\ngovernment' But the truth is that governors and\nstate legislators who arefamiliarwith balanced\nbudget strictures know that they don't necessarily\nwork, especially when elected officials don't want\nthem to work, and that in fact such strictures have\ntended to push pubbc officials into manipulative\nactions and outright decepoons.\nAlthough this behavior is usually limited to\nperiods of fiscal stress, states do run deficits,\nsometimes obvious but often disguised. Two recent studies, one from the General Accounting\nOffice and another from the Nelson A Rockefeller\nInstitute at Government, make this point\nGAO reports that of the 21 states that can carry\nover orfinancedeficits despite balanced budget\nmandates, at least 10 have done so one or more\ntimes in 1990, 1991 and 1992. The Rockefeller\nInstitutereportsthat from one to 11 states had\ndeficits in each of the years 1983 through 1991.'\nIndeed, the Department of Commerce's widely\nused national income and product account figures\nshow state and local government expenditures\nexceeding receipts by more than $50 billion in\n1991,1992 and 1993.\nThe potential perversity of a balanced budget\namendment can be seen in states that run de facto\ndeficits (though they are not called that)—mainly\nachieved by dubious practices that temporarily\npaper over actual deficits. Some examples are the\nshifting of expenditures to off-budget accounts,\nborrowingfrompoob of money outside the general\nfund and shifting thefinancingef functions to\nso-called independent agencies or authorities.\nStates can \"tuueT receipt and payment activities:\nThey acceleraterevenuereceipts such as tax\npayments so as to collect them in a year developing\nred ink, or they postpone expenditures to localities\nand school district suppliers, and delay refunds to\ntaxpayers and salary and expense payments to\nemployees—shifting them to the next year. These\nploys mask deficits.\nStatesreducecontributions to pension funds by\nforcing changes in actuarial assumptuos. They use\nthe credit markets. States can borrow repeatedly\nagainst the same assets, byrefinancingthem even\nafter the original debt has been mostlyrepaid,and\nfinally, states sell assets.

MARCH 2. j 995\nJim Hoagland\nClinton's Quagmire\nBill Clinton's determination to support\nMexican ex-president Carlos Salinas de\nGortari turned out to be a bad gamble. The\nAmerican leader's prestige is now unhappily invested more heavily in scandal-plagued\nMexico than in any other spot on the globe.\nSalinas, who helped cover up Mexico's\nfinancial problems in 1994, is now touched\nby revelations of even more sinister coverups involving Mexico's two national political assassinations last year. Late Tuesday,\nSalinas's brother, Raul, was arrested in\nconnection with the slaying of political leader Francisco Ruiz Massieu. A few days\nearlier, it had become clear that Salinas\nhimself had to have been aware of a massive, visible coverup in the earlier murder\nof presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and did nothing to stop the coverup.\nBut over the weekend, Clinton aides\ncontinued to push Salinas for an important\nnew job in the international trade bureaucracy. To do otherwise, it seemed, would\nhave cast doubt on the wisdom of Clinton's\noriginal substantial investment in Salinas.\nRefusing to admit inconvenient truths is\nrisky \"protectkm\" for a president. You\ncould ask Richard Nixon about Watergate,\nor Ronald Reagan about Iran-contra. By the\ntime a president's friends and aides get\nfinished protecting him, there is not much\nleft his enemies need to do.\nSalinas reluctantly bowed to the inevitable yesterday afternoon by saying he would\nno longer seek to become the head of the launched.

Only candor can reestablish\nconfidence now.\nSalinas quietly emptied Mexico's treasury to prop up the peso in 1994 to help\nensure his party's reelection. When the\npeso collapsed in December, administration\nofficials joined by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chainnan, raised an alarm that\nMexico could touch off a global meltdown in\nworldfinancialmarkets. Act now and ask\nquestions later, they urged Congress,\nwhich went along atfirstand then balked.\nIt appeared briefly as if Clinton would\npull ofi Operation Peso Shield, looking as\ndecisive in a financial crisis as George Bush\nhad looked against Iraq. But as the crisis\ndeepens and as new unpalatable revelations\nemerge, Mexico looks more like Clinton's\nquagmire.\n�THE WASHINGTON POST\nTHURSDAY,MARCH 2,1995\nWillard Gaylin and Allan Rosenfield\nMedical Morality: When Consent Is Not Informed\nEvery week seems to bring a new undocumented assault on the character of Or. Henry\nFoster, the U.S. surgeon general nominee.\nIn response to the disclosure that in 1974\nFoster performed a \"small number\" of sterilizations on severely retarded women (four\nseems to be the number), Charles Krauthammer asked whether it was \"ethical to perform\nsurgery and permanently sterilise women in\nno position to give consent\" [op-ed, Feb. 17].\nKrauthammer, who is not only a respected\njournalist but also a physician with a wellknown interest in and seusitivity to moral\nproblems in medicine, raised predsety the\nright question. Unfortunately he came to an\nuncharacteristically simpliatic judgment\nMedical ethics in this most individualistic of\n. all modern cultures has been \"autanomy\"-driv. en. Informed consent is at the heart of i t But\nwith the seriously mentally impaired, consent\nitself can be immoral—if not impossible—to\nobtain. For example, one would not allow a\nsignificantly impaired person to sign away her\nfortune and her security. Nor, by the same\ntoken, should she be allowed to make major\ndecisions that infringe on her health and survival. Whether she is to be subjected to an\namputation, a coronary bypass or a sterilization procedure will all be decided by others.\nIn the case q? the mentally impaired, we are\nforced to violate a cardinal principle of medical\nethics: We abrogate her authority to decide\nfor herself, assigning this right to others—the\nfamily or institutions of society and the state.\nSterilizatioa procedures have traditionally\naroused anxiety and distrust, particularly\ntions formed to defend them, which questioned even the definition of retardation.\nMainstreanung became the order of the day.\nOddly enough, this new attitude created an\natmosphere in which such extreme measures\nas permanent sterilization for the retarded\nwere discussed in terms of their beneficence\nand as promoting the rights of the individual.\nThe argument was that they would offer\nretarded persons an opportunity to participate\nin the new sexual freedom, unfettered by fears\nsince the World War D horrors of Nazi \"eugen- of pregnancies and child-rearing, which they\nics\" and the complicity, of German doctors in might not be able to manage.\n- All this is by way of pointing out that what\nracial experiments.

Moral dilemmas\nexist under all these conditions, and the proper resolutions in each case may be entirely\ndifferent.\nIn that debate a distinguished liberal philosopher argued that sterilization of mentally\nretarded persons would be morally mandated\nif it would \"enhance their position in the moral\ncommunity\" by facilitating their living together at home or in small communities outside\ntraditional institutions. We do not have to\naccept that particular argument, but what is\nclear to those of us who were privy to these\ndiscussions is that the moral question was not\nsettled then, as it is probably not settled now.\nIt is particularly unjust tc equate a doctor who\nperforms sterilization procedures for therapeutic reasons—even if you feel he is misguided—with doctors who participated in radiation\nexperiments on unconsenting, unsuspecting\nsubjects during the Cold War years, let alone\nthe obscene Nazi camp experiments.\nKrauthammer argues that \"sterilization of\nthe mentally infirm is a morally problematic\nprocedure\"; with that we heartily concur. But\nit is clearly immoral (nothing problematic\nhere) to impugn the ethical character of Henry\nFoster on the basis of sterilization procedures\nhe has performed or. for that matter,-on\nabortions he has performed.\nPeople of goodwill and good heart are entitled to hold differing views on emotionally\ncharged social issues (in-vitro fertilization,\nassisted suicide, organ transplants, genetic\nengineering or. for that matter, divorce, capital punishment and gun control) without being\ndemonized. For the Senate to form a judgment\non Dr. Foster's character on the basis of his\nhaving performed such procedures would be\nindefensible and indecent.\nWillard Gaylin is professor of psychiatry at\nColumbia University and co-fou nder of the •\nHastings Center.

MARCH 2,1995\nMexico Investigates a Murder\nITH THE ARREST of Raul Salinas,\nbrother of the former president, the\nprofound split in Mexico's government\nparty becomes more open to outsiders' view. Mr.\nSalinas is accused of setting up the assassination\ntest September of the secretary general of the\nInstitutional Revolutionary Party—the PRI. The\nparty has run Mexico with an iron hand that,\nfrom 1929 until very recently, permitted little\nchallenge. The struggle is between the reformers, who are working to turn Mexico into a\ngenuine democracy, and traditionalists determined to preserve the old style of order and\nprivilege.\nThe murdered party leader was a reformer.\nAnother was the party's then-candidate for presi\"dent, assassinated similarly last spring. Another\nis the man who succeeded him, the current\n'president, Emesto Zedillo. The movement to•ward free elections is being led from the top, but\nsupport is far from unanimous.\nMexico is hardly the only country that has\nbegun the transition to democracy in recent\n' years, but it faces a far more difficult passage\n'..than most. Unlike, say, Argentina or Chile, Mexi,co-is not merely replacing a bloody-handed military junta that had become bitterly unpopular—\nand the PRI has been in power much longer than\nthe juntas, long enough to form all of the'country's political institutions in its own image. Unlike\nw\n:\n:\nthe former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe,\nthe Mexicans are not throwing off foreign domination, and there is no surge of nationalism to\nhelp their democracy.\nA closer parallel is Spain and its evolution after\nthe death of the dictator Francisco Franco 20\nyears ago. But Spain had two enormous advantages. The distribution of wealth there was\nrelatively equal, ameliorating social tensions.\nMexico's is among the most unequal in the world.\nThat's what underlies the uprising in Chiapas.\nEqually important, Spain's democrats have had\nstrong and consistent support from their richer\nneighbors to the north. They made it very clear\nthat membership in the Common Market was\nopen only to countries that held fair elections.\nThe United States was never entirely explicit on\nthat point in negotiating the North American\nFree Trade Agreement. NAFTA continues to be\nunder noisy attack from American isolationists on\nthe left, just as the rescue of the peso is currently\nunder attack from the isolationists on the right.\nThe United States cannot greatly influence the\nenormous internal struggle now being played out\nover Mexico's political destiny. But Americans\nshould at least try to avoid undercutting leaders\nlike President Zedillo who are trying to advance\ndemocratic principles.\nOut of the Rubble in Richmond\nONE WAS even a pretense of Old Dominion courtliness at the General Assembly\nsession in Richmond this year. It started\nreal mean—when the legislators wouldn't even\ngive Gov. Allen the time on opening day to\naddress them in the customary fashion—and\nended with parting shots that would have had the\nburgesses blushing. But civility aside, as it was\nthroughout, the outcome proved to be a reasonable standoff that blocked the worst of Gov.\nAllen's bad agenda.\nThe front-page headline in the Richmond\nTimes-Dispatch last Friday carried the gubernatorial understatement of the season: \"Allen adI' niits he may have cut too deeply.\" Too dogmatically as well, if you ask lawmakers of both parties\nwho left him embarrassed with a huge defeat on\n' the budget. It was enough to rally Republican as\nwell as Democratic business leaders, educators\n' and other defenders of the state's higher educa3 d n system, who dynamited not only the gover'. nor's budget but also his notion that Virginians\nwould forsake any programs for a small tax cut.\nWhile conceding that his cuts were perhaps too\ndeep, the governor still isn't sparing the partisan\n\"insults, summarizing his opponents in the legisla. tUjre as contemptuous of Virginians and interest.jedonly in retaining their power and perks. \"They\nJeit they needed to deflate me and tear down my\nideas. They feel threatened from the last election\n'-and the elections this fall.\"\n^ \"that they took a beating last time was clear,\n_and it was underscored during last year's session,\nwhen the Democrats went along with nearly all of\nGov. Allen's major proposals focusing on crime\nG\nand an end to parole. But this year the governor's\ninsults and railroading attempts galvanized the\nDemocrats and made enough members of his\nown party uncomfortable that he suffered some\nhumiliating defeats.\nOnly a compromise on welfare—in which he\nand enough Democrats agreed on a stringent\nproposal for time limits on receiving benefits and\ngetting jobs—could be claimed by Gov. Allen as\nan advance. The plan is to force recipients into\njobs after 90 days and to cut their benefits after\ntwo years. It will affect some 74,000 poor women\nand their children across the state and deny\npayments for additional children bom to aid\nrecipients. The test here will be in how the state\nhandles the transitions of those who have long\nbeen out of work to the availability and obligations of work.\nThough he didn't do well during the regular\nsession, Gov. Allen isn't ready to surrender to\nthe legislature yet. He has a line-item veto to test\nopposition at an April 5 session and then will tum\nto the voters in November, when all 140 legislative seats are up for election. Republicans must\npick up three seats in each chamber to become\nthe majority. With Gov. Allen able to use his\noffice to assist the campaigns of Republican\ncandidates, the Democrats may find themselves\non the defensive in some parts of the state. But\nas some of the most nervous Northern Virginia\nRepublicans during this session noted, politics is\nstill local, and Gov. Allen may not be all that\nhelpful.\n�THE W S I G O POST\nA HN T N\nTHIRSDAV. MARCH 2,1995\nMaking a Bad Amendment Worse\nHE SENATE keeps trying to fix the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The fixes only make it worse. To pick\nup a couple of needed votes, the sponsors agreed\nto limit the authority of the courts to interpret\narid enforce the amendment. To pick up a final\nvote, they are being asked to put Social Security\nout of harm's way as well. The bidding for votes\nonly underscores the basic hypocrisy of the\nexercise. This is an effort once again to let\nmembers parade in favor offiscalresponsibility\n\\yhile deferring the means of achieving it. If in\nthe process they trivialize the Constitution and\ndestabilize the traditional balance of powers,\nwell, that's tomorrow's problem for someone else\nto solve.\nThe balanced budget amendment's sponsors\nhave never been able to answer the enforcement\nquestion. The rule would be that Congress could\nadopt unbalanced budgets only by three-fifths\nvotes of both houses. What if it cheated, as it has\ndone so often in the recent past, and achieved the\nrequisite balance only by fudging thefiguresor\ndeclaring some spending \"off budget\" and not\npart of the official accounts? The normal procedure would be to take an unconstitutional act of\nCongress to court, but an unelected judiciary\nought not to be writing the budget. So rightly\nSaid Sam Nunn and other waverers; to win them\nover, the sponsors have added language that \"the\njudicial power of the United States\" shall extend\nfo this amendment only insofar as Congress may\nlater allow.\nNowhere else in the Constitution is there such\nlanguage. The courts have themselves decided\nthat under the Constitution they should defer to\nthe other branches in certain circumstances, but\nin those cases it was the courts that were doing\nthe deciding; the fundamental principle that the\njudiciary interprets the Constitution was not\nbreached. Nor does the language that too easily\nsatisfied Mr. Nunn solve the enforcement prob-\nT\nIK*-\" I\nlem; it only papers it over. If the courts can't\ndiscipline an errant Congress except with Congress's consent, to whom does that job fall? Why\nwon't a future president say it's up to him to\nimpound unconstitutional spending? Then you are\nback where you started; the contours of the\nbudget are once again a political issue for the\nelected branches to fight over in the usual way.\nAs with the courts, so also with the Constitution:\nIt should not be invoked to solve a political\nproblem to which it is not suited.\nThe second of the current issues, having to do\nwith Social Security, is the perfect illustration of\nwhy this is so. Some of the senatorial holdouts\nsay they will vote for the amendment only if\nSocial Security is protected. But why should it\nbe, except for the fact that a seventh of the\npopulation receives the benefits? They want to\nexempt it even though they also want to balance\nthe budget largely by spending cuts, and it\naccounts for a fourth of all spending for other\nthan interest on the debt. Is it special because it's\nso important? Why not, then, exempt defense and\nlaw enforcement and the budget of the Internal\nRevenue Service and who knows what else—perhaps spending to stave off hunger and provide\nhealth care—as well? Or perhaps it's exempted\nbecause it has its ownfinancingsource, but then\nso does much of Medicare and the highway\nprogram.

Its members went to the\nsame schools. They worked their way up\nthrough government ranks together. They\niiyed in the same areas and aie liii sanv.\nrestaurants. They married one another's\nsisters. They protected each other, even\nwhen someone committed a crime.\nBut the new president, who was never\nmore than an adopted orphan in that\npolitical family, has\nsaid that Mexico\nnow will be ruled by\nlaws and institutions and not by the\npersonal connections built up over\nthe years within the\nruling elite.\nActually, Mr. Zedillo had been saying such things\nsince he became the\nruling party's accidental candidate for\nEmesto Zedillo\npresident, thrust\ninto the job when his predecessor was\nassassinated last March. It is just that now\npeople are beginning to believe him.\n\"Zedillo has just changed the rules of\nMexican politics for the first time in 66\nyears,\" said Raymundo Riva Palacio, a\npolitical commentator whose cousin is an\nambassador. He cited the 1929 formation of\nthe ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) as the last change of similar\nmagnitude.\nIf President Zedillo can make the\nchanges stick, the result will be a far more\ndemocratic country. Mexico would also be\nmuch more understandable to foreign investors, who, not having grown up exposed\nto the political family, have often found it\nhard to figure out who had an in with\nwhom.\nBut it will be tough going for the new\npresident, a 43-year-old economist inexperienced in politics. He already is facing an\neconomic crisis that he set off with his Dec.\n20 devaluation of the peso, which has\nsapped the strength of his support among\nMexicans. In addition, powerful political\nfactions have a vested interest in maintaining the old, familial system because of\nthe corruption it allowed.

While refusing to\nconcede defeat is ahead, he acknowledged\nRepublicans had not won over the hTth vote\nthat would provide the two-thirds margin\nfor approval.\n�Social Security Provision Appears\nTo Be Key to Senate Controversy\nContinued From Page A2\nmanly that they seek a more honest accounting of the government't books.\nThis is about whether we will be\nhonest and true to our word on creating\ntrust funds for future generations,\" said\nSen. Dorgm\nSupporters of the provision also say\nthat by completely separating the S 5\n32\nbillion in Social Security funds from the\nrest of the SI.6 trillion budget. Congress\nwouldn't be tempted to tamper with the.\nretirement program in an effort to lower\nthe deficit.\nOthers, however, see their demand as a\nbackdoor method of killing the amendment.\n\"This is crazy,\" says Martha Phillips of\nthe Concord Coalition, an advocacy group\nthat favors lower deficits and a balancedbudget amendment. \"It's a sheer political\nact. They are letting the misguided idea of\nthe best get in the way of the good. They\nare hurting the cause of deficit reduction.\"\nBudget experts also agree that provision would greatly hinder chances for\nratification by the states. \"We all know\nwho is going to pay first for cutting the\nbudget - the states.\" says Joseph White, a\nbudget expert at ther Brookings Institution. \"With this included, it makes it much\neasier for people to say \"it's just not worth\nit,\" he said.\nHere's how the provision would work:\nCurrently, Social Security each year\npulls in more money than it pays out in\nbenefits. This extra money is invested in\nj U.S. Treasury bills, which reduces the\ni amount of money the Treasury has to\nborrow from private investors. While this\nsurplus cannot be spent on anv other\ngovernment program-and must be held in\nreserve - the goverment's bookkeepers\ncount it as part of the total federal income\nin making their budget calculations. In\nshort. Social Security's surplus helps mask\nthe size of the government's deficit! But\nthe surplus funds would also eventually be\nused to pay out benefits when Social\nSecurity's outlays exceed revenues, starting in the year 2019,\nIf Social Security were exempted from\nthe overall budget calculation for 1996, the\ndeficit would be S 3 billion larger than\n7\ncurrently estimated. Over the next seven\nyears, fully exempting Social Security's\n;\nsurplus would add S 3 billion to the defi66\ncit.\nEven without the Social Security exemption, the task of those who seek to\nbalance the budget is monumental. \"Any\nincrease to that deficit,\" says Mr. White,\n\"would make balancing the budget virtually impossible.\"\nRepublican congressional leaders\nechoed that appraisal. \"They are trying to\nmake it impossible in the short run to\nbalance the budget,\" said House Budget\nCommittee Chairman John Kasich (R.\nOhio).\nEven so. Democrats who have seized on\nthe issue are emerging from this week's\nSenate drama energized by their appearance as saviors of Social Security. \"It's a\nbig victory for Democrats and Social Security,'' House Democratic Leader Richard\nGephardt boasted yesterday.\nThe emphasis on Social Security has\nhelped solidify the resistance to the\namendment, resistance that includes several members of the Democratic leadership who have previously supported the\nmeasure. Crossing generational lines, this\nbloc includes Minority Leader Thomas\nDaschle of > South Dakota as well as his\nwhip and second-in-command, Sen. Wendell Ford of Kentucky. And looming behind\nlike some masterful stage manager is the\nformer Democratic Senate leader, West\nVirginia Sen. Robert Byrd, who clashed\nheatedly with Senate Majority Leader\nRobert Dole Tuesday night.\nAlthough most attlention has focused on\nMessrs. Dorgan and Conrad, Republicans\ndespaired yesterday of getting their votes.\nInstead, attention turned to a Democrat\nfacing re-election next year, Sen. John\nKerry of Massachusetts, and Democrats\nDianne Feinstein of California and Harry\nReid of Nevada.\n-David Rogers contributed to this article.\n71\n>\nr\nr\nz\n>\nr\nH\nx\nc\na\n>\n33\n>\n/I\nClinton Outlines Plan to Lift Export Ban\nOn the Oil From Alaska's North Slope\nBy TIMOTHY NOAH\nStaff Reporter of T H E W A L L STREET JOURNAL\nWASHINGTON - The Clinton administration, in testimony before Congress, outlined its plan to lift the export ban on oil\nfrom Alaska's North Slope.\nSeveral influential members of Congress have long pressed for lifting the\nexport ban - which was a condition imposed by Congress when it approved the\ntrans-Alaska pipeline in the 1970s-and the\nadministration has offered them much\nencouragement. Foremost among oil companies advocating the change has been\nBritish Petroleum PLC.\nBut until yesterday, the White House\nwithheld formal support of any specific\nplan, citing practical problems involving\ntrade and other matters. Now a resolution\nto these problems has been found, according to Deputy Energy Secretary William\nWhite. In testimony before the Senate\nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, Mr. White said the president would\nsupport a bill lifting the ban provided it\ncontained several specific protections.\nAlthough environmentalists voiced\nsome objections, Mr. White's statements\nbefore the committee make it highly likely\nthat the Alaska ban will be lifted this year.\nThe Republican chairmen of the Senate\nEnergy committee and the House Natural\nResources committee - Sen. Frank Murkowski and Rep. Don Young - are both\nAlaskans who strongly favor lifting the\nexport ban.\nMr. White said the bill must permit the\npresident to reinstate the ban should ex-\nport of the oil harm the economy, the\nenvironment or energy security in the\nU.S. He also said the oil must be exported\nin U.S.-flag vessels with U.S. crews (so as\nnot to deprive jobs to U.S. workers, who by\nlaw currently man the ships that bring\nAlaska North Slope oil to the lower 48\nstates). The exports must also be found not\nto cause \"substantial increases to retail\ngasoline or other petroleum product\nprices,\" Mr. White said, or result in crude\nsupply shortages on the West Coast, where\nmost of the Alaska North Slope oil ends up\ntoday.\nPreviously, Mr. White had said the\nadministration was concerned that guaranteeing U.S. crews for ships carrying\nAlaska North Slope oil might violate international trade agreements. But in his\ntestimony. Mr. White said that the administration now views the flag-preference\nrequirement as \"unique\" and that it\n\"shouldn't be viewed as opening further\npossibilities for cargo preference, which\nthis administration strongly opposes.'.' Mr.\nWhite said the administration.wouldn't\nsupport any move to require that the ships\nbe U.S.built.\nA spokesman for Mr. Murkowski said\nthat only one of the conditions proposed by\nMr. White would require further negotiation between the administration and Congress: that before the oil be exported, an\nenvironmental impact assessment be\nmade under the National Environmental\nPolicy Act of 1970. According to the\nspokesman, no such assessment has ever\nbefore been a condition of granting an\nexport license.\n:\n�Charges of Brutality\nMay Place Future\nOf Iditarod on Ice\nContinued From First Page\nand they compared the Iditarod's competitors to Hitler and Stalin.

Peacekeeping Kole\nIs Likely to Gain Steam in House Vote Today\nBy CARLA ANNE ROBBINS\nStaff Reporter of T H E W A L L S T R E E T J O U R N A L\nWASHINGTON - The Republicans have\nfound a target to replace the \"evil empire\": the United Nations. And if they get\ntheir way, the U.N. could be out of the\nbusiness of peacekeeping.\nThe assault on the U.N. is part of a\nbroader challenge to President Clinton's\nforeign policy contained in the National\nSecurity Revitalization Act, which the\nHouse is expected to approve today after\nthe Democrats surprisingly won some revisions last night. The bill, part of the GOP's\n\"Contract With America,\" reflects a deepseated Republican fear that the U.S. is\nlosing its military dominance in the world\nand a deep-seated conviction that the U.N.\nis to blame.\nAt the start of yesterday's tumultuous\ndebate, California freshman Rep. Andrea\nSeastrand summed up Republican anger,\nsaying the bill would \"ensure the U.S. is\nnot a servant to the U.N.\" and that\nAmerican troops \"would not serve in a\n(U.N. I blue beret when they serve the red,\nwhite and blue.\"\nDecline in Standing\nThe U.N.'s standing has declined\nsharply with the U.S. public since 1990,\nwhen Congress insisted President Bush\nfirst seek Security Council authorization\nbefore it would support the Gulf War. And\nalthough the world body has had some\ngenuine successes in recent years-including Cambodia and Mozambique - spectacular failures in Somalia and Bosnia have\npersuaded many Americans that the organization isn't just wasteful, but actually\ndangerous. Defenders say the U.N., at\nboth its best and worst, is almost always a\nservant of the Security Council, most\nprominently the U.S.\nPresident Clinton, who came out\nagainst the GOP bill this week, has contributed to the current bash-the-U.N. atmosphere. Mr. Clinton used the U.N. as a\nscapegoat for American over-reaching in\nSomalia-the 1 Army Rangers killed there\n8\nwere under U.S., not U.N. command - and\nhe continues to blame the U.N. for American inaction in Bosnia.\nAt the same time, Mr. Clinton doesn't\nwant to lose the United Nations. In a\nstrongly worded letter to House Speaker\nNewt Gingrich, Mr. Clinton argued that\nthe U.N. is a useful to^l, especially when\nless-than-vital interests are at stake. And\nhe warned that the legislation could \"place\nU.S. forces at greater risk by forcing us\nto act unilaterally or not at all.\" In a flurry\nof news conferences and speeches this\nweek, Mr. Clinton's top advisers sought to\nportray the fight as one between internationalism and isolationism rather than a\ndefense of the U.N. itself.\nWarning of \"Star Wars Redux.\" House\nDemocrats last night managed to defeat a\nkey \"Contract With America\" provision:\nhottest button issue\" for American voters,\nsays GOP Rep. Floyd Spence of South\nCarolina, chairman of the National Security Committee. \"They start screaming\nand clapping whenever it s mentioned.\"\nIt's also largely moot because, in the wake\nof Somalia, Mr. Clinton pledged to keep\nU.S. troops under U.S. command whenever\nthere is a serious risk of combat.\nDemocrats last night also were able to\nstrike a provision that would have required\ncongressional approval before any U.S.\ntroops can join a U.N. peacekeeping mission. Congress historically has shied away\nfrom taking responsibility for sending U.S.\ntroops into battle, a fact that Republicans\nrealized belatedly. They agreed to delete\nU.S. Role in U.N.\nthe provision without debate and on a voice\nPeacekeeping\nvote.\ni us.\nThe administration has focused almost\n1994 assessments for U.N.\nshare\nall of its fire on the bill's funding restricpeacekeeping, in billions\ntions, which it says would \"bankrupt\"\nU.N. peacekeeping accounts.\nDemand for Credit\nCharging that the U.S. is being unfairly\n\"double billed,\" the Republicans are demanding the U.N. credit the U.S. for every\n1994 total military troops and observers dollar Washington spends on Americanrun, U.N.-blessed missions - even when,\nas in the Haiti intervention or enforcing\nsanctions against Iraq, that blessing is\nlittle more than a diplomatic fig leaf for\nU.S. action.

Even as Democrats celebrated the\nunexpected success, administration officials said what most concerned them about\nthe bill was the peacekeeping portion,\nespecially because Senate Majority leader\nRobert Dole has written similar restrictions into his \"Peace Powers Act.\"\nAs written, the House bill would constrain U.N. peacekeeping operations in\nseveral ways. Its ban on deploying American soldiers under foreign command, except under extreme circumstances, is \"the\nresult, she says, is that the U.N. would stop\ndoing peacekeeping, forcing the U.S. \"to\nact alone or not at all.\"\nWith victory in sight, the Republicans\nthis week began to play down the effects of\ntheir own legislation. Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New York, a moderate Republican\nwho is chairman of the House International Relations Committee, says the bill\nisn't intended to kill off peacekeeping but\nonly to ensure that the U.S. pays \"its\nequitable share.\"\nReducing Dues\nAs for what's equitable. Mr. Oilman\ncites a presidential-waiver provision Re\npublicans recently added to the bill that\nhe estimates would have reduced U.S.\npeacekeeping dues by only $227 million last\nyear - rather than the zeroing out predicted by the Democrats. When asked if\nsuch a modest savings was what his party\nand the U.S. public had in mind, Mr.\nGilman suggested future cuts could also\n\"go a lot higher\" , to $ 0 million, $400\n30\nmillion or more.\nWhile $227 million isn't a large savings\nfor the U.S. budget, it would be a \"devastating\" cut for a \"U.N. budget that is\nbasically in deficit.\" says Iowa Rep. Jim\nLeach, one of the organization's few GOP\ndefenders. If the U.N. gets out of the\nbusiness of peacekeeping, he argues,\n\"we'll have to look for much more expensive alternatives\" to solve the world's\nmessiest problems.\nFor now at least, the Clinton administration is pinning most of its hopes on the\ntraditionally more-cautious Senate. It's\nalso hoping that the latest test for the\nU.N.-U.S. partnership, in Haiti, comes off\nwithout a hitch. At the end of March, the\nU.N. will formally take over the U.S.\nmission in Haiti. To maintain control, the\nU.S. will leave a two-star general in command, and 2,400 of the 6.000 remaining\ntroops will be American.\nH\na\n(73\nO\nH\nX\na\no\n>\na\nI\n>\n3\n�House Leaders Agree to Give States\nMore Flexibility With Food Stamps\nBy HILARY STOUT\nS t a f f Reporter of T H E W A L L S T R E E T J O U R N A L\nWASHINGTON - Republican governors, unhappy with the GOP congressional\nleadership's decision to keep food stamps a\nfederal program, have won concessions\nfrom House leaders to give states more\nflexibility in running the $27 billion program.\nThe 31-year-old food-stamp program\nsupplies vouchers to poor people to buy\ngroceries.

He said a state could\ngo so far as to cut off an entire family from\nfood stamps if the adult refuses to go to\nwork.\nMoreover, under the agreement, states\ncould \"cash out\" food stamps for some\nwelfare recipients who go to work in\nprivate-sector jobs, giving certain recipients money that could be spent on items\nother than food. The measure is \"part of\nour effort to make work pay,\" said Mr.\nEngler.

ANDERSON\nS t a f f Reporters of T H E W A L L S T R E E T J O U R N A L\nWASHINGTON - Senate Finance\nChairman Bob Packwood is weighing\nwhether to preserve a tax break for Viacom\nInc. that is critical to the media concern's\nproposed S2.3 billion sale of its cable-television operations.\nThe House voted last month to rescind\nthe break by retroactively repealing a\nFederal Communications Commission program designed to encourage minority ownership of media properties. Under the\nprogram. Viacom would receive a tax\nbreak of S 0 million to $600 million\n40\nbecause it arranged to sell its cable-TV\nsystems to a partnership led by black\nmedia executive Frank Washington.\nSen. Packwood said in an interview\nthat he wants to find out if the Viacom\ntransaction was a \"done deal\" when the\nHouse began to act earlier this year, and\nwhether the deal represents an \"egregious\" abuse of the tax code. He indicated\nhis decision will rest on the outcome of a\nSenate Finance Committee hearing next\nweek.\nThe Oregon Republican expressed concerns that the House appears to be singling\nout Viacom by repealing the FCC program\nas of Jan. 17; the cable-TV deal was\nannounced days later. The company recently said that without the tax break, it\nwould halt the transaction. \"Republicans\nmade a big deal about retroactivity last\nyear,\" Sen. Packwood said. Throughout\nthe last Congress, Republicans upbraided\nPresident Clinton and Democrats for supporting retroactive.tax increases on upperincome individuals.\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Bill\nArcher (R., Texas) said he attempted this\nweek to allay Sen. Packwood's concerns.\n\"This is a transaction,\" said Rep. Archer,\nadding that he put the private sector on\nnotice about his intentions in mid-January.\nTied to Insurance Deduction\nIn the House, lawmakers tied repeal of\nthe FCC program to a popular proposal to\nreinstitute a 25% tax deduction for health\ninsurance purchased by self-employed individuals. Repealing the FCC program\nwould raise SI.6 billion over five years,\nhelping to pay for the deduction, which\nexpired last year and which lawmakers\nwant to revive before the April 17 tax-filing\ndeadline.\nRep. Archer suggested the Senate,\nbogged down on the balanced-budget\namendment, needs to act quickly. \"We're\ngoing to be leaving here after the first week\nin April,\" he said, indicating that the\npopular tax deduction must clear the Senate by then if lawmakers want to meet the\ntax-filing deadline.\nSome senators would like to see the FCC\n;\nprogram repeal split from the tax-deduction measure. While they are eager to\napprove the deduction quickly - 75 senators signed a letter in January backing\nrenewal of the program-they fear igniting\na divisive, protracted debate on affirmative action. House debate on the matter\nlast month was racially charged, with\nliberal black lawmakers accusing GOP\nleaders of taking the first step toward\ndismantling affirmative action. GOP leaders have argued the FCC program is rife\nwith abuse, and said the partnership that\nwants to buy Viacom's cable systems is\nbacked by Tele-Communications Inc., the\nnation's largest cable-TV company.\nThe newest member of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen.

In addition, the\npercentage of suppliers reporting, slower\ndelivery times held steady during the\nmonth, suggesting price pressures aren't\nbuilding.\nGiven Federal Reserve Chairman Alan\nGreenspan's recent remark that the vendor-performance component of the survey\nis an important inflation gauge, the report\nseems to be just what the Fed has been\nlooking for: A sign that the. economy is\nslowing and that material prices, which\nhave been rising fairly significantly in\nrecent months, aren't in danger of overheating.\nRichmond Federal Reserve Bank President J.

The Commerce\nDepartment said the economy grew at a\n4.61 annual rate, not the 4.51 pace reported last month.\nWhile the revision was tiny, the components making up economic growth were\nadjusted significantly, painting quite a\ndifferent picture of what drove the economy in the final phase of last year. Inventories, which many analysts thought had\nbuilt up too quickly in the fourth quarter,\nactually increased only $48.1 billion - less\nthan in the third quarter. Net exports were\nrevised upward by SM.5 billion. There\nwere smaller upward revisions to consumer spending, federal government purchases and residential investment, while\nthe investment in durable equipment was\nrevised slightly downward.\nImproved Inflation Picture\nThe inflation picture also looked better.\nThe implicit price deflator was revised\ndownward to 1.31 growth from 1.61. The\nfixed weighted price index remained the\nsame at 2.61.\nThe purchasing managers report found\nthat production, new orders and employment all grew more slowly in the manufacturing sector last month. Despite a slowdown in jobs, \"a number of purchasing\nmanagers reported tight markets in manufacturing labor in their areas,\" said Ralph\nKauffman, chairman of the survey and.\nmanager of procurement and materials at\nOryx Energy Co.\nIn the latest report, purchasing managers also expressed concern over the\nMexican peso crisis. Export orders slowed\nlast month, and several companies said the\nproblems in Mexico played a role.\nAlso, the Commerce Department said\nconstruction spending fell 0.21 in January\nto S426.3 billion, after adjustments for\ninflation.

Israel - For years, radical Islamic groups in the West Bank and\nGaza Strip have been Israel's Me noir. But\nlately, officials have begun worrying about\nwhether there's a growing Islamic threat\nin the heart of Israel itself.\nAn Islamic movement among Israeli\nArabs is enjoying growing electoral clout.\nIn the most recent municipal elections, its\nmembers won seats on more than a dozen\nlocal councils and captured the mayoralty\nor council chairmanship in seven places.\nIslamic leaders say they may set up a\npolitical party to run for Israeli Parliament\nseats in the 1996 national elections.\nIf Israel's S O O Arab citizens unite\nOO O\n.\n; behind a party backed by the Islamic\nmovement, experts estimate that Arab\nparties can increase their representation\nin the 120-member Parliament from five\nseats to as many as 15, giving the communitv unprecedented leverage in Israeli poli: tics!\nSo great is the perceived threat that the\nopposition Likud party is discussing\nwhether to try to bar the Islamic movement\n• from running in the next elections.\nThe movement's current rise is fueled\nby frustration over the peace process\namong Israeli Arabs, who make up 181 of\nthe Israeli population. Israeli Arabs had\nexpected the peace agreement between\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization to bring about an end to decades of\ndiscrimination in jobs, housing and education. Instead, more than a year after the\n• Israel-PLO deal, many Israeli Arabs feel\nthat Mr. Rabin is making peace with the\ncountry's Arab enemies but continuing\nto neglect the demands for equality by\n. Israel's own loyal Arab population.\n\"We are no longer ready to sacrifice\nour own interests for the sake of the peace\nprocess.\" says Sheik Ibrahim Sarsur, an\nMamie movement leader.\nThe Islamic movement's origins lie in\nthe Family of the Holy War, an underground paramilitary group set up in the\nearly 1980s whose 70 Israeli Arab members\nwere arrested and sentenced to prison\nterms after carrying out a number of acts\nof sabotage, including arson. Since then,\nthe group has been careful to stay within\nthe bounds of Israeli law.\n\"We obey Israeli law, and we accept\nIsrael's right to exist.\" says Sheik Sarsur.\nBut one Israeli official says, \"They\nskate right on the edge.\" and worries that\ntheir unspoken message to followers encourages anti-Israel sentiments. Leaders\nof the Gaza-based Islamic Jihad say some\nIsraeli Arabs have volunteered to lead\nsuicide attacks against Israeli targets.\nThe movement's power comes from the\nvast social infrastructure it has built up\nover the years. Using donations of money,\nIslamic activists also upset the delicate\nbalancing act performed by the current\ncrop of Israeli Arab politicians. Walid\nSadik, an Israeli Arab serving as the\ndeputy minister of agriculture, shares\nmany of the same goals as the Islamic\nactivists but believes the best chance for\nadvancement lies in Arab integration\nwithin existing political parties. The movement's aggressive \"Arab power\" message.\nI\nn many ways, Kafr Bara represents what most\nfrightens Israeli Jews about the Islamic\nmovement.

The trees, flowers and gardens\nthat line the clean streets were planted\nduring annual labor camps sponsored by\nIslamic activists. Volunteers from Kafr\nBara and surrounding villages put in the\nstreetlights, set up the playgrounds,\npainted the schools, laid the sidewalks\nand constructed the sewerage system.\nKafr Bara's 1.700 residents donated cash\nand jewelry to help fund a 5335,000 community center.\nIn many ways, Kafr Bara represents\nwhat most frightens Israeli Jews about the\nIslamic movement. It sets up \"a semiautonomous socioeconomic system.\" says\nElie Rekhess of Tel Aviv University. \"The\nfear is that this could be the first step to a\nsecessionist movement.\"\nKafr Bara's mayor. Sheik Kamel\nRiyan, says Israeli Jews have demonized\nthe movement. But he also declares that\n\"Jerusalem is an Islamic city\" and \"All of\nPalestine is Islamic land,\" statements that\nmake Israeli Jews uneasy about whether\nthe movement's acceptance of a Jewish\nstate in part of Palestine is sincere or\nmerely the pragmatic response of a minority trying to get along with the dominant\nculture.\ncontends Mr. Sadik, may increase the\nnumber of Arab seats in the Parliament in\nthe next elections, but will ultimately scare\nthe ruling Labor Party into the arms of the\nright-wing Likud and result in the creation\nof a national unity government that will\npay even less attention to Arab concerns.\n\" I don't think the Islamic movement\ncan deliver the goods. They see the world\nin black and white.\" says Mr. Sadik.\n\"National politics requires seeing all the\ncolors in the middle.\"\nAnd'yet for all their differences, the\npeace process is narrowing the distance\nbetween moderates like Mr. Sadik and\nIslamic activists. The two sides find common ground on the issue of Israel's\nfundamental identity.\n\"If Israel remains the Jewish state, and\nnot the state of all its citizens,\" says Kafr\nBara's Sheik Riyan, \"then there will\nnever be true equality here.\"\n�i.\"\nTHE WALL STREET JOi t O , ^\nIQO;\nL E G A L BEAT\nEmployers Confront Domestic Abuse\nBy JOSEPH PEREIRA\nS t a f f Reporter of T H E W A L L S T R E E T J O U R N A L\nPatrick Thomas was sentenced to life in\nprison in 1993 for gunning down his former\ngirlfriend at her Houston office.\nThen, the family of 22-year-old Francesia La Rose sued her employer and the\nproperty firm that ran the office building\nfor failing to protect her - even though she\nnotified them that a restraining order had\nbeen issued against Mr. Thomas.

But that's changing, with more\nwomen in the workplace, high divorce\nrates and more antistalking orders against\nabusers.

That left the bond market without a\nclear trend during the session and fueled\ndebate about the market's next move.\n\"The economic data has been mixed,\nand that alone wasn't enough to justify the\nstrength we've seen in this market in\nrecent weeks,\" said Hugh W'helan, vice\npresident of fixed-income at Aeltus Investment Management Inc. of Hartford,\nConn.\nIn late New York trading, the 36-year\nTreasury bond was down less than '*\npoint, or less than SI.25 for, a bond with a\nS.

Yesterday, it dipped as low as 7.42^.\nBond yields, which move in the opposite\ndirection of prices, have fallen because of a\nbelief among market participants that\neconomic growth has begun to slow in\nresponse to seven boosts in key interest\nrates in the past year by the Federal\nReserve.\nHowever, the bond-buying frenzy appears to have ended, and some fear the\nmarket could shed its recent gains. However. Aeltus Mr. Whelan said any declines\nin prices won't be dramatic, and that the\nbond market is more likely to remain in a\nrange while investors and analysts try\nto assess the extent of the slowing in\ngrowth.\nMr. W'helan. who sees the 30-year bond\nyield staying between 72 % and 7.75% for\n.5\nthe time being, said investors shouldn't try\nto \"time\" the market, or sell ahead of an\nTreasury Yield Curve\nYields as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern time\n8 00%\n7 50%\n—\n•\nYesterday\n1 weeK ago\n|_\n4 -.-.•eeks ago\ni\n5.50%\n3\n6\n1\n2 3\n5 7 10\n10\nmos.\n.7'\n'\nr,3i„.-:ies\nx^'/rff ectrn>c3l Cm stendData\nT\nYIELD COMPARISONS\nBasea on -verrill Lvncn Bond indexes.

Testifying in the House Banking\nCommittee, Mr. Rubin warned lawmakers\nnot to set up so many safeguards and\n\"fire walls\" that the benefits of diverse\nfinancial-service entities are thwarted.\n\"While we believe that appropriate\nfire walls can be very helpful, there also is\na real danger that they can become excessive and rigid in nature,\" he said.\nThe administration criticized a pro-\nposal by Rep. Jim Leach (R.. Iowa), chairman of the banking panel, because it\nnesses be set up as separate subsidiaries\nunder a holding company. Mr. Rubin's\nplan would allow a bank to create or\nacquire a securities subsidiary.\nMr. Rubin also took exception to a\nprovision in the Leach bill that would\nrequire the different financial subsidiaries\nto have separate boards. Mixing the directors could be \"appropriate and even beneficial.\" he said.\nThe secretary said financial affiliates\ncould be structured so that losses from a\nsecurities or insurance unit wouldn't affect\nthe capital of the parent bank. Specifically,\nhe said that under the administration plan,\na federally insured bank could set up a\nsecurities affiliate, but not count the capital of that unit as part of the bank capital.\nIn such a situation, he added, \"the subsidiary could get wiped out, but not affect the\ncapital of the bank.\"\nMr. Rubin also stressed that the greatest risk for a bank is a traditional loan, not\na securities underwriting. A bank often\ncarries a loan on its books for years, while\nin an underwriting, the investment bank\nmoves the securities through in a matter of\nhours.\nWhile pushing for the financial deregulation.

Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote. If\na search is unlawful because of a clerk's\nerror, excluding the evidence it yields\nwon't directly affect the behavior of the\nH\na\nofficer on the street, he continued.\nw\nThe chief justice rejected the idea that\ncourt clerks are inclined to undermine the\nFourth Amendment, or that exclusion of\nevidence would deter misbehavior by such\nclerks. Undergirding this whole line of\n50\nreasoning was a 1984 Supreme Court preceM\ndent in which the high court said that\nevidence gathered by police relying in\nCM\n\"good faith\" on a faulty warrant shouldn't\no\nbe thrown out.\nThe majority opinion left open the\nquestion of whether evidence should be\nsupressed if a computer-record error is the\nH\nfault of a police officer, rather than a\nX\na\ncivilian court employee.

BARRETT\nS t a f f Reporter of T H E W A L L S T R E E T J O U R N A L\nWASHINGTON - The Supreme Court,\nin a pro-prosecution decision, ruled that\njudges shouldn't throw out criminal evidence gathered improperly on the basis of\nfaulty computer records.\nThe 7-2 ruling was a reminder that even\nfollowing two appointments by President\nClinton, the Supreme Court remains moderately conservative on many criminal-law\nissues. One Clinton appointee, Justice Stephen Breyer, joined the majority opinion;\nthe other. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\ndissented.\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice\nWilliam Rehnquist cast the decision in\nnarrow terms, shaped by the specific facts\nof the case. Some scholars had anticipated\nthat the high court might use the case to\nmake a broad statement about the application of the Constitution to computer-age\ntechnology in. law enforcement. But the\nchief justice refrained from any such, pronouncements.\nThe ruling concerned the prosecution of\nIsaac Evans, of Phoenix, on drug charges.\nA police officer stopped Mr. Evans in 1991\nfor a routine traffic violation. Using a\ncomputer terminal in his patrol car. the\nofficer discovered a misdemeanor arrest\nwarrant for Mr. Evans.

But his swipe at religious moderates aside. Mr. Reed is simplywrong. Sure, there may be agreement\namong Republicans on much of Newt Gingrich's \"Contract With America.\" But\nwhen Religious Right political groups turn\ntheir focus on curbing reproductive freedoms, pushing organized classroom\n. prayer, defunding public television and depriving gays and lesbians of the basic rights\nof citizenship, Mr. Reed's peace declaration\nwill be about as likely to ward off war in the\nGOP as Neville Chamberlain's umbrella.\nActually, the opening shots were being\nfired-by Mr. Reed himself-even before\nhis Wall Street Journal article appeared.\nJust days before he used your paper to call\nfor \"unity\" and \"civil[ityl in disagreement\" between economic and religious\nconservatives, Mr. Reed was drawing a\nline in the sand over abortion. If either the\n' 1996 Republican presidential or vice presidential nominee favors a woman's right to\nchoose, Mr. Reed vowed to a conservative\ngathering, his supporters would abandon\nthe GOP ticket.\nFor those who may be confused, Mr.\nReed's apparent about-face was just the\nmost recent example of the Christian\nCoalition's good cop/bad cop routine. Good\ncop Reed tells the press he is promoting\nRep. Gingrich's Contract as part of a broad\n\"pro-family\" agenda. But bad cop Reed\ntells his followers that working for the Contract is a tactical maneuver to force Republican Party support for the coalition's\nmore divisive social agenda. Moreover, the\nescalating battle over the nomination of\n•Dr. Henry Foster as Surgeon Generaland Religious Right leaders' increasinglynasty rhetoric-are exposing as fallacy\nMr. Reed's efforts to portray budgetary issues as his constituents' first priority.\nSo let's put the smiley buttons aside and\nlook at the real Christian Coalition agenda,\nwhich is already emerging in Congress.\nMr. Reed backs the effort to junk the\nNational Endowment for the Arts, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the\nLegal Services Corporation even as he\nfails to explain how cutting support for museums, educational children's television,\n. and local music and dance groups would\n• help the families for whom he expresses\nsuch concern. He pushes the discredited\nnotion that public TV viewers are all\nwealthy, and asks why they should be\nspared when single mothers are asked to\n.make sacrifices. Where is all that compassion when Mr. Reed calls for cutting the\nLegal Services lawyers who represent\nthose mothers in seeking child support\nfrom deadbeat dads or challenging mis• managed child-welfare bureaucracies?\nOn education, Mr. Reed says, we need\nto \"shift power and responsibility for educating children away from Washington\nand return it to local school boards and\nparents.\" Sounds reasonable, but the truth\nis that primary responsibility for educating children has never been in Washington; that responsibility overwhelmingly\nrests with parents, local boards and state\neducation officials. The language of\nparental control used by Ralph Reed actually puts a populist veneer on a radically\nantipopulist goal: vouchers that would undermine public education by siphoning its\nWrong Spin on Ruling\ni On Cellular Spinoff\nresources to private religious schools-in\nmany cases to so-called Christian academies originally created to avoid r;:da! ini\ntegration of the public schools.\nFinally, Mr. Reed calls for Congress\nto \"secure religious liberty and freedom\nof conscience for all citizens.\" Once\nagain, he advances a noble-sounding\ngoal to promote something far different.\nThere is no need for a constitutional\namendment to secure religious freedom.\nWe have the First Amendment, which although constantly challenged by Mr.\nReed and his mentor Pat Robertson, still\nis the greatest guarantor of religious liberty in the world today.\nThose of us who are familiar with the\nChristian Coalition's strategy-putting a\nmoderate face before the public while\nreassuring hard-core activists that patience will bring victory' for the extreme\nsocial agenda-are adept at reading between the lines.\nARTHUR KROPP\nPresident\nPeople for the American Way\nWashington\nYour Feb. 2 editorial \"Justice s Air\nBall.\" about our AirTouch decision, is out\nof touch with both the facts and the law.\nFirst, we agreed with AirTouch that\nits new spunoff cellular business should\nbe freed from many of the restrictions of\nthe consent decree that broke up AT&T.\nWe offered to support the company in a\nwaiver request.\nBut AirTouch flatly turned us down and\nchose all-out litigation instead because of\nits objection to being labeled a \"successor\" to Pactel, its Baby Bell parent. Virtually all antitrust decrees contain provisions making them applicable.to \"successors\" in order to prevent easy evasion by\nsimply spinning off a new corporate Entity\nto the same shareholders.\nSecond, our decision does not mean,\nas you imply, that every time a Regional\nBell Operating Company sells a piece of\nreal estate or a cellular tower, the purchaser is subject to the decree. Isolated\nasset sales are not the same as spinning\noff an entire business, as was the case\nwith Pactel's cellular operations.\nFinally, even though we disagreed with\nAirTouch on the applicability of the decree, we indicated we would not seek\nsanctions against it during the time it\nasks the court for a declaratory ruling. In\nshort, we have been more than fair with\nAirTouch. while at the same time carrying out our legal responsibilities to enforce the consent decree.\nWe agree on one thing, however: on the\nneed for federal legislation to set a national policy on telecommunications. But\nthat legislation must also preserve the central role for real competition that motivated the AT&T case and breakup, events\nwhich have helped revolutionize telecommunications markets in the U.S. and kept\nour telecommunications industry ahead of\nthe rest of the world. The administration\nwill be working with the Congress this\nyear to produce such legislation.\n* * *\nMr. Reed has me very confused. Is the\nman who authored this piece the same man\nwho, three days earlier (before a CPAC\nmeeting in Washington), threatened the\nRepublican Party with a \"litmus test\" for\nits national ticket? Did he not say that\n\"pro-life and pro-family voters will not support a ticket that retreats from its noble\nand historic defense of traditional values\nor which has a national ticket or a platform\nthat does not share Ronald Reagan's belief\nin the sanctity of innocent human life?\"\nSeventy-two hours later Mr. Reed was\nsaying it is best to acknowledge disagreements over issues such as abortion\nforthrightly and \"discuss them freely\nwhile stressing unity on the broader\nagenda.\" Mr. Reed would do his membership and registered Republicans nationally a great service by deciding\nwhether he is the angry firebrand or the\nmore moderate party builder.\nThe Christian Coalition is an important\nvoice in a much larger choir. Recent figures show that the Christian Coalition's\nmembership represents only 157c of registered Republicans nationally. And while\nWashington\nthe turnout of self-identified born-again\nevangelicals in the last election was commendable, it was still only 22% of the total\nRepublican turnout.\nSen. Arlen Specter put it concisely\nwhen he said that Mr. Reed's remarks\nmake \"second-class citizens\" out of any\npro-choice Republican who may aspire to\nthe party's nomination. \"The Republican\nParty will not be blackmailed by any special-interest group. Our nominee will be\nselected in the Republican primaries.\"\nI would encourage Mr. Reed to consider\nGov. William Weld's remarks, as quoted in\nthe Associated Press, that it is intellectually dishonest for conservatives to advocate less government \"while keeping a foot\non individual liberty.\"\nANNE K.

In 1990. his development company\nwanted to turn SiO\nacres of prime real\nRestate near Austin,\nTex., into shops and homes.

So Mr. Perot's\ncompany did what just about anybody would do — it chopped down ihe\ntrees as fast as it could.\nAs environmentalists line up to\ncondemn the House Republicans'\nstream of regulatory reform bills,\nthey should bear in mind, that our\ncurrent laws often don't do what\n(hey imend to do.

FEBRUARY 16. 1995\nThe Myth of Deadbeat Dads\nBy STV\\RT A. MILLER\nChild-support collection has' recently\nbecome a big issue in Washington. President Clinton issued an executive nrcler this\nweek requiring all federal agencies \\o facilitate the payment of fathers' debts. And\nHealth and- Human Senices Secretary\nDonna Shalala testified that if we collect\nall of the child support owed by Americans, we would reduce the $200 billion welfare cost by 25^. In fact. Republicans and\nDemocrats alike count on increased child\nsupport collections as a cornerstone of\ntheir welfare reform plans.\nYou don't have to be a member of the.\nworld champion U.S. Math Olympiad team\nto see that there is something wrong with\nthose calculations. Even under the rosiest\nprojections of the government's Annual\nChild Support Report, in 1992 (the last year\nfor which data are available! there was\nabout $10.9 billion in court-ordered child\nsupport owed by all Americans and, of\nthat, a little more than $6 billion was paid.\nThis leaves $-1.9 billion in unpaid child support in 1992-far short of the $50 billion Ms.\nShalala hopes to raise.\nBut it's virtually impossible even to collect the smaller amount of child support\nobligations. We've tried many times over\nthe past 1 years, yet no effort has in0\ncreased the percentage of collections for\nwelfare mothers (the biggest target group)\nby more than r,.\nThis is due to a number of factors.\nFirst, of the 30' > of child support payments\nnot collected, a significant number are\nowed by fathers who are imprisoned. A\nhigh percentage' of prisoners have childsupport obligations, and as many as onethird of the inmates in many county jails\nare there in the first place because of child\nsupport noncompliance.\nMany of the other delinquent fathers are\naddicts, alcoholics, disabled, mentally incapacitated, unemployed, or otherwise unable to pay pre-set child support amounts.\nBut the largest number of all delinquents\nare those who simply don't exist.\nRecently, the Florida Department of\nRevenue, the agency responsible for child\nsupport enforcement in that state, sent out\n7(10.000 notices to allegedly delinquent fathers. The summonses demanded immediate payment or the recipient would be incarcerated. Subsequently, officials acknowledged that probably 500,000 of those\nnotices were sent to individuals who actually did not owe child support. One of those\nrecipients, Daniel Wells, died eight years\nago in a traffic accident, but the state still\nwanted him to cough up $160,000 in pastdue -child support! (About the same\namount of money Florida wasted on\npostage for the notices.)\nNor is this an isolated case. The General Accounting Office found in 1992 that-as\nmany as l-Tc of fathers who owe child support are dead. The report further stated\nthat 66^ of fathers who owe support \"cannot afford to pay the amount ordered.\"\nThe easiest way, then, to increase the\nfigures on child-support collections is simply for the government to make an accurate tally. Until this happens, it's impossible to discuss remedies for the child-support problem.\nOnce a serious discussion gets under\nway, one of the first items on the agenda\nshould be the inherent unfairness in taking something away from people and then\nmaking them pay for it. Most, fathers are\ndeeply committed to their children, yet a\n1991 Census Bureau study found that about\nhalf of fathers receive no court-ordered\nvisitation. When fathers do receive visitation, almost SO'\" pay all of their child support on time.and in full. When fathers receive joint custody, the child-support compliance rate jumps to more than 90'\".\nJoint custody is the cure to the child\nsupport problem and is the closest thing to\na two-parent family that we can give a\nchild. Unfortunately, more than 90': of litigated divorces result in an award of sole\n. custodv to the mother.\nEven when fathers do receive court-ordered access to their children; their visitation attempts are often met with interference by the mothers. Joan Berlin Kelley\nand Judith Wallerstein. in \"Surviving the\nBreak-Up\" (Basic Bonks, IW.JI. fnunci that\nalmost half of all mothers see no value in\nthe father's continued contact with his children following separation or divorce. Sanford Braver, a University of Arizona psychologist, confirmed these figures and\nfound that up to 40'\"' of mothers interfere\nwith the dad's relationship with his kids.\nGiven this documented connection between a father's access to his children and\nthe payment of child support, why d\"es\nWashington seem intent on punishing the\nfather'. What about the mother who creates\na climate encouraging noneumplianee?\nOne way around this problem may be to\nmake child-support obligations more equitable. At'the moment, child support is almost exclusively the burden of fathers.\nThe federal Office of Income Security Pol- ',\nicy found in •1991 that less than :',>)' '. of custodial fathers receive a child support\naward, whereas almost SO'- of custodial\nmothers do. Yet about 47, of those moth- J\ners who are ordered to pay support totally :\ndefault on their obligation. In the interest\nof fairness, if nothing else, policy makers\nshould make an effort to collect child support from both delinquent fathers and\nmothers.\n'\nBut of course the only real long-term :\nanswer is to support the two-parent f.imily-preferably in marriage a-i\\d. if that •\ndoesn't work, through joint custody\narrangements. We need to re-engage lathers in their children's lives. Draconian'\ntransfer-of-wealth schemes will continue\nto be as ineffective in the future as they\nhave proved to be in the past, no matter\nhow aggressively they are enforced.\n1\nr\n1\n.l/r.

True, in\n\"Putting People First.\" Gov. Clinton and\nSen. Gore vowed that they would \"oppose\nracial quotas.\" But Mr. Clinton, like many\nin both parties who say they oppose quotas, never explained precisely what such\nopposition would mean. Nor did he feature\nthis particular promise in his campaign.\nAs president, Mr. Clinton's greatest\nclaim to civil rights fame-meaning the\none he and his associates tout-concerns\nexecutive and judicial appointments made\non the basis of \"diversity,\" the now fashionable word for race and gender. He\nwidely advertised for a female attorney\ngeneral, for example, and persevered\nthrough the ill-fated choices of Zoe Baird\nand Kimba Wood until he finally got one.\nPolitical Correctness\nWithin the administration itself, some\n.of Mr. Clinton's more dedicated subordinates have imposed political correctness\nupon federal workers. Regional administrators for HUD were told last year, for example, that to meet performance standards each should participate \"as un active member of a minority, feminist or\nother cultural organization.\"\nAs for people Mr. Clinton has appointed\nto civil rights posts, Mary Frances Berry,\nhead of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission,\nis on record as saying that \"civil l ights\nlaws were not passed to give civil rights to\nall Americans\" but only to \"disfavored\ngroups\" such as \"blacks. Hispanics and\nwomen.\" The president hasn't appointed a\n\"new Democrat\" critic of affirmative action to a civil rights j o b - i n fact very few\nnew Democi ats labor anywhere in his government.\nWith regard to policy, until late last\nweek. Mr. Clinton had said nothing to suggest that reform of affirmative action even\ninterested him. Given the record of his administration, moreover, the conclusion is\nunavoidable that Mr. Clinton has sought to\nstrengthen and extend, and even revive,\naffirmative action.\nIn 199,'t. Education Secretary Richard\nRiley overturned a Bush administration\npolicy interpreting federal law as prohibiting universities receiving federal dollars\nfrom offering scholarships on the basis of\nrace. Under the new policy, colleges don't\nhave to premise race-exclusive scholarships on a showing of past discrimination\nand can determine for themselves whether\nthere have been instances of racism in\ntheir past. In a law enforcement action in\nkeeping with the new Education policy, the\nJustice Department's Civil Rights Division\nhas defended, so far unsuccessfully, the\nUniversity of Maryland's Banneker Schol-\nilornians favor. Because California is crucial to Mr. Clinton's re-election strategy,\nand because the future of affirmative action is emerging as a major campaign issue, he cannot afford to be complacent\nabout affirmative action as currently practiced, much less defend it in the unyielding\nterms advanced by, say, Jesse Jackson.\nMr. Clinton's new position has thankfully tended to silence defenders ol statusquo affirmative action who (all anyone\nwho proposes to reform or eliminate it a\nracist comparable to Hitler. Hut what is\nthe administration's review likely to produce? Almost certainly another battle for\nMr. Clinton's soul.\nOn civil rights, we have seen such a\nbattle before, in 1993, when the President\nGiven the record of his administration, the conclusion\nis unavoidable that Mr. Clinton has sought to strengthen\nand extend, and even revive, affirmative action.\narships, available only to black students.\nThe Bush administration had stayed out of\nthis case, brought by a student of Costa Rican descent.\nDeval Patrick, the assistant attorney\ngeneral in charge of the civil rights division, recently told the Washington Post,\n\"There is good affirmative action and\nthere is bad affirmative action.\" Hut on his\nwatch there has been no bad affirmative\naction. With respect to education, employment, contracting and voting rights, the\nJustice Department has yet to find a racial\npreference it cannot defend in court. Indeed, the department has even switched\nsides on the appeal of a reverse discrimination case from New Jersey that was\ncommenced by the Hush administration\nand won al Ihe trial level by the Clinion administration in lfW4.\nNow, the reasons for Ihe emergence of\nthis newest Hill Clinton are obvious. In a\nword: California. In Ultlti, Californians will\nlikely vote on an iniliative that would deny\nthe state and local noveniinenls the ability\nto use race or gender either lo prefer or\ndisadvantage citizens in decisions conceruiiig em|iloviiieiit, cilucalion and contracting. Most of Ihe GOV presidenlial contenders already have endorsed the initiative, which surveys show a majority of (\"al-\nhad to decide whether to withdraw the\nnomination of Lani Guinier, his first\nchoice to head the civil rights division. Mr.\nClinton finally sided with his more moderate advisers and withdrew her name, after, he said, he had read Prof. Guinier's\nwritings and concluded he disagreed with\nher. But, pleasing his liberal critics, Mr.\nClinton then proceeded to appoint Mr.\nPatrick. It is hard to imagine how a\nGuinier tenure could have differed significantly from Mr. Patrick's.\nIf the Guinier chapter is any guide,\nthen in the long run the affirmative action\nreformers inside the administration will\nlose. That raises the question of just what\nthe long run is, and whether Mr. Clinton\nintends to make some gestures toward\ntnoderalion as a ploy to win in l'J% so that\nhe can cotilimie the government's current\nracialist policies in liMT.\nThis analysis, Mr. (Minion would say, is\ncynical. So, on ihe chance that ihe president is serious about rethinking affirmative action, how should he proceed':'\nFor one. it will no longer do for him to\nvoice opposition only lo \"(|iiotas.\" He's al\nready clone so, to no effect. The real issue\ncoiiceins whether goveriiiiienl should be\nallowed to make racial dislinctions .iinong\ncilizeiis and, if so, in what context, lor\nH\nwhat imrposes. and fur how long. When\ngovernment contiiiiies to sanction racial\npreferences on an eflectively perpetual basis, for whatever reason, it is hard lo see\nhow we as a society are ever going to (|iiii\njudging people by the color of their skin.\nThat was the gr eat goal of (he original civil\nrights movement, and it reniaius a worthy\none. Race is not a morally legitimate basis\nfor derision-making, whether by government or private entities.\nOnce Mr. Clinton knows his own mind\non this question, the rest becomes easier.\nIf he decides that government should not\nmake race a ground of decision, he can\nthen consider whether to base affirmative\naction on economic disadvantage, as both\nsome Republicans and new Democrats\ncontend.\nA preference on this basis may make\npolitical sense for a Democrat, even a new\nDemocrat, and may even make policy\nsense. The answer to this question, in any\nevent, would not balkanize society or violate the Constitution. It is, therefore, a less\nimportant question than the one involving\nrace-unless, of course, affirmative action\nbased on disadvantage were to be transformed through administration into the\nracially preferential variety.\nExpound and Defend\nIn reforming and eliminating current\naffirmative action. Mr. Clinton can issue\nexecutive orders, rewrite regulations, and\nalso recommend legislation. He can proceed rapidly or slowly in this task, as prudence dictates, but he must proceed. All •\nthe while, of course, it will be necessary for\nhim to expound and defend to the nation,\nover the objections of the predictable critics in his party and indeed his own adininistration, why for ihe sake of all Americans\ngovernment should nol make race a basis\nfor allocating benefits and o|iporlimilies.\n1 Hill Clntlun wauls to pull oil Hie\n1\nequivalent in domeslii policy of Kichanl\nNixon's opeiiiiigto China, that's how lo gel\nthere from here.

So we have to assume\nthat Ernst & Young didn't meet the margin\ncalls, and that the clearinghouses of the\nexchanges are now \"managing\" the Barings positions.\nGenerally speaking, the rules of the exchanges are that when a customer fails to\nmeet a maintenance margin call, his position is sold. And in this case, selling fast is\nall but essential, because the market is not\nlikely to recover much while sp great a\nweight of contracts hangs above it.

Mullins, USA TODAY\nSocial Security has become\nthe biggest program in the federal government, spending\n$336 billion this year, 22% of\nthe entire federal budget, nearly one-fifth of the economy.\nConrad and others oppose\nthe GOP-sponsored amendment because they want to separate the Social Security system from budget-balancing\ncalculations.\nThey are not opposed to any\ncuts in benefits. They acknowledge that adjustments will be\nneeded as the number of retirees grows and the number of\nworkers paying taxes to support benefits declines.\nInstead, they say they object\nto the federal government using Social Security revenues to\nmask the true size of the budg-\net's imbalance, nearly $70 billion this year.\nThe Social Security system\nnow collects more in taxes\nthan it pays out in benefits.\nThat was the intention of the\n1983 Social Security revision\nenacted by Congress and\nsigned by President Reagan. It\ntrimmed future benefits, provided that some retirees be\ntaxed for the first time and\nraised payroll taxes.\nThe idea was that surpluses\nwould be amassed unUl early\nin the next century, when the\nexplosion of retirees would\nstart drawing down the reserves.\nInstead, what's happening is\nthe government is spending Social Security's surplus as quickly as it flows in. The trust fund\nholds government lOUs.\n\"They have a point, which\nwe've known for years,\" says\nNorman Ornstein of the conservative American Enterprise\nInstitute. \"This is an issue with\na substantial history.\"\nWhat Conrad, his North Dakota colleague, Byron Dorgan,\nand others want is an end to\nthe current practice.\nBut moving Social Security\noff the page would make the\nannual federal deficit even\nlarger than it is today and\nmake budget balancing almost\nimpassible.\nAlready, advocates of a balanced budget must find $1.2\ntrillion in spending reductions\nfrom anticipated levels to bring\nthe federal budget into balance\nby 2002. Taking away the So-\nc\ncial Security surplus would add\n$600 billion to that total\nCongress may not be capable of such a task. But the picture may change.\nSocial Security's surplus will\ncome to an end by about 2010,\nwhen demands for benefits\nwill outstrip revenues. Even\nwith the lOUs called in, the\ntrust fund will be bust in another 20 years.\nWithout adjustments in Social Security, the deficit problem of the future will be in that\nprogram, topping $1 trillion a\nyear by then.\nCritics say a Constitution that\nbarred deficits but excluded a\nprogram that far out of balance\nwould be meaningless.\n�Election time\nmay tell winner\nof budget fight\nBy Jessica Lee\nand Judi Hasson\nUSA TODAY\nSenate Democrats brought a\nkey element of the Republican\nrevolution to a halt this week in\na political fight that could either boost their party's fortunes in 1996 or make them\nvulnerable to more election\nlosses.\nDemocrats may have\nslowed the Republicans' legislative juggernaut by refusing\nto hand up the one vote needed\nto pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced\nbudget\nThey accused Republicans\nof refusing to exempt Social Security funds from being used to\nbalance the budget\nAt the same time, Democrats exposed themselves to\nRepublican charges that they\nare tax-and-spend liberals\nflouting the popular will to\neradicate red ink in order to\nprotect big government programs for their constituents,\nlike senior ciUzens.\nSenate Majority Leader Bob\nDole, R-Kan., after a day\nmarked by backroom negotia•ns, name-calling and biameiying. recessed the Senate\nwhen it became clear Wednesiay he was one vote short of\nTHUI SD/ V.

But the\nGOP leaders are one vote short of victory , they need the\nvotes of at least one of North Dakota's two Democratic\nsenators, Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan, who both want the\nSocial Security fund totally divorced from the rest of the\nbudget before they agree to vote for the amendment.\nThat change would protect Social Security benefits from\nthe fiscal pressures that are sure to build in Washington\nin the coming years if the balanced budget amendment is\npassed. Social Security is perhaps the most popular and\nsacrosanct program in the federal government, providing\nretirement, death and disability benefits to 45 million\nAmerican families. Insulating it would help avert the\npotential for a political firefight every time Congress\ndeals with the budget.\nYet it will also keep a huge pot of money out of the\nreach of lawmakers who will be scrambling to bring\nspending and revenues into balance as the amendment's\ndeadline of 2002 approaches. Social Security is the\ngovernment's single biggest program, and slicing it out of\nthe budget-balancing equation would create havoc\nthroughout the rest of the federal establishment. The 1996\nbudget would be $66 billion higher if the surplus in the\nSocial Security trust fund was not available as an offset;\nwithin four years, Social Security will be running annual\nsurpluses of close to $100 billion. Thus, Congress would\nhave to impose far more draconian spending cuts or face\nup to steep tax increases to cover that gap.\nLawmakers would haye to find at least another $558\nbillion over the next seven years on top of the $1.2\ntrillion now estimated to be the total cost of achieving a\nbalanced budget by 2002.\nThe Social Security trust fund is accumulating an\never-growing balance, which now stands at roughly $500\nbillion. That balance is expected to peak at $2 trillion\naround the year 2013.\nBut isolating that trust fund wouldn't necessarily\nprotect Social Security from budgetary gimmicks. Analysts\nwarn that taking Social Security out from under the\nbalanced budget law will increase the incentive for\nCongress to dump unrelated programs into Social Security\nto benefit from its exemption. \"1 could see how we could\nexpand the definition of Social Security in order to cover\nlots of favored spending programs; we could end up with\nwelfare being counted as Social Security,\" argues Henry\nAaron, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in\nWashington.\nBut while Social Security looks like a tempting source\nof funds today and for the near future, ultimately it will\nface an enormous budgetary crisis of its own, one that\nCongress and the public have yet to confront. The\ndemographic bulge that is expected to be caused by the\nretirement of the Baby Boomer generation after the turn of\nthe century will shift the fund from annual surpluses to\nyearly deficits after 2012 or 2013. By 2029 the huge shift\nof boomers from working status to retirement will have\nexhausted the entire $2 trillion balance, the Social\nSecurity Administration predicts. And, if no action is\ntaken before then, the fund will go broke.\nThus, a constitutional amendment that isolates the fund\nmay limit the long-term solutions that Congress can use to\naddress that looming crisis.\nGOP to Propose Tough Work Requirements in\nFood Stamp Program (Washn) By Elizabeth\nShogren= (c) 1995, Los Angeles Times=\nWASHINGTON In an abrupt change of course on welfare\nreform, congressional Republican leaders have decided to\nsubject the government's $27 billion food stamp program to\nthe same kind of stringent work requirements they intend\nto impose on cash benefits, according to congressional\nsources.\nThe plan, details of which will be released later in\nthe week, would also allow states to set time limits for\nfood stamp eligibility that are in accordance with their\ntime limits for cash welfare.\nUnder the overhaul, able-bodied people between 18 and\n50 without dependent children would be required to work\nwithin months of receiving food stamps.\nAlthough food stamps would be retained as a federal\nprogram, states would have authority to impose some of\ntheir own rules, such as eliminating food stamps to\nrecipients who lose their eligibility for cash assistance\nunder Aid to Families with Dependent Children, according to\nthe new rules, which are being drafted by the House\nAgriculture Committee.\nThe development could have far-reaching implications\nfor the federal program, which has been the most generous\nand widely available part of the safety net in America for\ndecades.\nOther welfare programs have been provided only to\ncertain people\nfamilies with dependent children, the elderly or disabled\nbut food stamps are available to any one who is hungry and\npoor. The changes in the food stamp program that have been\nagreed upon by the House leadership would put an end to\nthat.\nThe GOP welfare reform plan attached to the \"Contract\nWith America\" did not call for work restrictions on food\nstamps but envisioned handing control of the program to\nthe states. Republican leaders decided only a few days ago\nnot to follow through with their original plans.\nBy retaining the program at the federal level, House\nRepublicans stressed, they would maintain one program to\nsmooth the transition as states were taking over much of\nthe rest of the safety net for the poor.\nBut GOP congressional aides said Wednesday that the\nfederal food stamp program would be changed to reflect the\nsame philosophies driving the reform of other welfare\nprograms: people should only receive public assistance if\nthey work and Congress should restrict the growth of\nwelfare programs.\nThe GOP food stamp initiative would prevent the costs\nof the program from growing, the aides said. Predictions\nshow that under current law, costs for food stamps would\nexpand from $27 billion to $35 billion.over five years,\nbut congressional aides said the new measure would cut\ncosts from the current level.\nAbout 40 million people use food stamps during the\ncourse of a year, and at any one time about 25 million\npeople receive the benefit. Twenty percent of the\n�households receiving food stamps currently have some earned\nincome.\n(Optional add end)\nAdministration officials said they did not have a\nresponse to the GOP plan to place work restrictions on\nfood stamps, but stressed that the measure represents a\ndramatic departure from the goals of the program first set\nforth by President Kennedy when he created it in 1961.\nWhile income maintenance programs have had combined\ngoals of supporting poor families and helping them get on\ntheir feet again, the only goal of food stamps has been to\nmake sure people do not go hungry.\n\"You measure success of nutrition programs by whether\nthey prevent hunger. It's a different goal,\" said Neil\nFlieger, deputy administrator of the Agriculture ,\nDepartment agency that runs the food stamp program. \"The\npresident's (welfare reform) proposal recognized that\nnutrition programs were the ultimate safety net. Nutrition\nprograms were not part of the package that was subject to\na two-year time limit.\"\nClinton Spares Colombia From U.S. Sanctions\n(Washn) By Norman Kempstei- (c) 1995, Los\nAngeles Times=\nWASHINGTON President Clinton spared Colombia from\nU.S. sanctions against governments implicated in the narcotics\ntrade Wednesday despite what officials called \"pervasive\ncorruption\" of the South American nation's political and\njudicial systems by the cocaine cartels.\nIn his annual report to Congress, Clinton said\nColombia's anti-drug effort fell far short of what is\nrequired but he waived the economic penalties set by U.S.\nlaw because he concluded that it was in the U.S. national\ninterest to continue normal dealings with the country\nincluding flawed but better-than-nothing cooperation\nagainst drug traffickers.\nOverall, Clinton certified that the governments in 18\nof the world's 29 narcotics producing or transit countries\nhave \"cooperated fully\" with international\nanti-narcotics efforts. At the other end of the scale, he\nimposed sanctions on five countries, denying them U.S.\nforeign aid and export-import bank credits and requiring\nWashington to veto loans to them from the World Bank and\nother international lending institutions.\nIn a middle group were six countries in which\nanti-narcotics efforts were found to be inadequate but\nwere the administration decided to withhold penalties. In\naddition to Colombia, the waivers were granted to Bolivia,\nLebanon, Pakistan, Paraguay and Peru.\nMost U.S. aid to Colombia and to the coca-producing\ncountries of Bolivia and Peru is in the form of assistance\nto anti-narcotics programs. So i f the administration\nimposed the sanctions specified by U.S. law, the result\nwould be to further damage already crippled law\nenforcement, programs.\nSanctions were ordered for Afghanistan, Burma, Iran,\nNigeria and Syria. Of those five, Iran and Syria are also\non the State Department's list of countries that support\ninternational terrorism, which imposes the same sanctions\nrequired by the drug law.\nRobert Gelbard, assistant secretary of state for\nnarcotics and law enforcement, was unstinting in his\ncriticism of Colombia although he said the United States\ncannot simply walk away from the pivotal country in the\nadministration's Western Hemisphere narcotics-control\nstrategy. In addition to dominating 80 percent of the\ncocaine market, traffickers in Colombia also control about\n12 percent of the heroin smuggled into the United States.\nOn Capitol Hill, Republican members of the Senate\nForeign Relations Committee called on Clinton to impose\nsanctions on Colombia. Gelbard said the president\ndetermined that such a step would be counterproductive.\n(Optional add end)\n\"We are seriously concerned that there have been no\nmajor drug prosecutions in Colombia,\" Gelbard said. Even\nwhen drug figures are prosecuted, he added, the courts let\nthem off with '' slap on the wrist\" penalties. Moreover,\nhe said Colombia has no adequate law against money\nlaundering and does not take adequate steps.to seize the\nassets of drug traffickers.\n\"We are hopeful that in 1995 we will see better\nperformance by Colombia,\" he said.\nAt the same time, Gelbard said the U.S. government is\n\"aware\" of reports that Colombian President Ernesto\nSamper has close links to the Cali cocaine cartel. He said\nSamper recently apologized to the cartel because police\ninterrupted the birthday party of a cocaine figure, an\nincident that he said provoked \"our very great concern.\"\n\"We have been fundamentally concerned about the ...\npervasive corruption throughout political institutions at\nall levels\" in Colombia, Gelbard said.\nHe said U.S. officials have discussed the issue with\nsenior members of the Samper government in recent weeks\nand \"there can be no doubt in their mind about our\nexpectations.\"\nHigh Quality of -Bases Complicates Choice of\nClosures (Washn) By Richard A. Serrano= (c)\n1995, Los Angeles Times=\nWASHINGTON Decisions this year over which military\ninstallations to save or scuttle \" w i l l be all the more\ndifficult\" because only the best facilities are left\nafter three earlier, grueling rounds of closings, the\nchairman of a special base-closing commission said\nWednesday.\nAlan J. Dixon, head of the independent Defense Base\nClosure and Realignment Commission, said that the\nPentagon's recommendations would close fewer bases this\nyear but larger ones than in the past, providing more\nbudget savings.\nWhile previous closings have provided long-term savings\nof less than $16 billion, officials hope that the new\nround will trim as much as $18.5 billion from the defense\nbudget.\nThe Pentagon is recommending that 33 major military\nbases close their gates this year in the fourth and final\nseries of base closings under the current law. In\naddition, the Pentagon wants to shut down or curtail\noperations at another 113 installations.\nIn all, about 34,200 civilian jobs are on the line. And\nlocal officials around the nation are gearing up to try to\nconvince Dixon and his panel that their communities should\nbe spared.\nBut at the commission's first hearing in Washington,\nDixon and top Pentagon leaders said that the most painful\nclosings must come this year.\n\"What you might call the easy decisions have all been\nmade,\" Dixon said. \"We are down to, for the most part,\nexcellent bases, many with a long and distinguished\nhistory of support for our armed forces. Our decisions\nthis year will be all the more difficult for that\n�reason.\n(Optional add end)\nGen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint\nChiefs of Staff, said the armed services will be about 34\npercent smaller over the decade stretching from the end of\nthe Cold War to the end of this century. He said that the\nmilitary budget will fall by about 40 percent.\nEven so, \"after three rounds of base closures and\nrealignments, our infrastructure is only projected to be\n15 percent smaller.\"\nUnder the law, the commission now begins the process of\ndeciding whether to spare any of the installations or\nleave the list intact. Next week, each of the service\nchiefs are scheduled to justify for the panel why they\ntargeted the installations under their domain and\ncommission members then plan to visit many of the sites\nand hear arguments from local officials on why individual\nbases should be spared.\nThe SEC has been criticized for not taking action after\nthat meeting. SEC officials have replied that it yielded no\nindication of fraud and that the commission has limited\nauthority over local governments. Hearings about that\nmeeting might be a good idea, one SEC official said.

The bureau now\npursues thieves of business secrets through laws barring\nwire and mail fraud and interstate transportation of stolen\nproperty. To erase doubts about FBI jurisdiction, many\nprefer a federal statute outlawing theft of intellectual\nproperty the object of most economic espionage.\nBusinesses are expected to welcome the idea, but some may\nhave doubts. That's because the law wouldn't just curb\nespionage by foreign interests.

Rubin was the former chairman of brokerage giant\nGoldman, Sachs & Co., which marketed more than $5 billion\nin Mexican securities between 1992 and 1994.\nRubin should have avoided any involvement because \"you\ncan't forget who you are or where you came from,\" Rep.\nSpencer Bachus, R-Ala., chairman of the oversight\nsubcommittee of the House Banking Committee, said\nWednesday. He promised a hearing by the end of the month.\n(Begin optional trim)\nIn Mexico City, the Mexican Stock Exchange's key index\nfell 31.88 points to 1,517.96 Wednesday, even though\ninterest rates on Mexican treasury bills auctioned\n�Wednesday came down somewhat from last week's\nstratospheric\nlevels.\nStill, rates are around 50 percent, reflecting the\ncrisis of confidence in the Mexican economy and the\ngovernment. The general disarray was heightened by\nTuesday's arrest of the brother of former President Carlos\nSalinas on charges that he ordered and planned the\nassassination of a key ruling party official last year.\n(End optional trim)\nBachus and other Republicans are defying their party's\nleadership, which agreed with President Clinton on the\nneed for the aid package to help Mexico whose economy\ncracked in late December under the weight of a severe\ntrade deficit and a sudden devaluation of the peso!\nThe administration argued that fears over Mexico could\njeopardize the ability of many other fast-developing\nnations to raise capital.\nThe GOP dissidents will force a vote at Thursday's\nRepublican conference on their demand that their party\nbring the issue to a vote on the House floor. They want a\nvote on a bill that would block the administration from\nproviding funds without prior Congressional approval.\nIf the critics are successful at the Republican\nconference, the full House will get a chance to express\nitself on the idea of financial aid for Mexico. Many\nmembers, upset at the political difficulty of cutting\npopular domestic programs, will be reluctant to cast a.\nvote for what would be perceived as unpopular foreign aid.\n(Optional add end)\nRubin, who is in charge of the loan guarantee program,\nwas defended vigorously on Wednesday as a man of integrity\nby Leach and several Democratic members. They were angered\nby criticisms from Bachus and other Republicans about the\npotential conflict of interest or appearance of a\nconflict.\nRubin left Goldman Sachs, where he had served as\nco-chairman, to join the Clinton administration, and\nplaced his assets in a blind trust.\nGoldman Sachs was the lead underwriter for Mexican\nsecurities, arranging the sale of $5.7 billion worth of\nissues between 1992 and 1994. Goldman Sachs' own holdings\nof Mexican securities currently are less than $100\nmillion, small compared with the firm's assets of $130\nbillion, according to knowledgeable sources.\nTreasury ethics officials gave Rubin a ruling that it\nwould be permissible for him to become involved in the\nMexican issue.\n�-\"THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1995\nBudget talks\nfail to sway\n67th senator\nDemocrats\nget tougher\nas tally nears\n< \"OS\" '\n2\nV\n* <S BO\n« S «« M\nSir-\nBy Pat^ce Hill\nh\n<S\nsee BUDGET,\npage A12\nl«le -gQ\n.2 Q - 2\nB\n*- a « o Si\no\nae\nc\n« «J U M\nJS t l 3 .

A leader who guided Republican presidents through battles large and small. A leader who,\nwhen necessary, worked with\nDemocrats. A leader who held a\nfractious party together to torpedo\nparts of the Clinton agenda.\nIn this context, few issues in the\n104th Congress hold more promise or peril for Mr. Dole's presidential campaign than the balanced-budget amendment, which\nthe Senate is scheduled to vote on\ntoday.\nDOLE\nFrom page Al\nsuffer because — fairly or unfairly\n— primary voters will remember\nthe amendment perished on his\nwatch.\nAnd when key parts of the \"Contract With America\" die in the\nSenate, as many Republicans expect, Mr. Dole will have a harder\ntime persuading primary voters\nthat he could consolidate the revolution of 1994 and build on it in\n1996.\n\"It surely puts a much higher\nburden on him to pass something\nelse significant in the Contract,\"\nRepublican strategist Eddie Mahe\nsaid.\nBut the items in the Contract\nthat stir primary voters — tax\ncuts, welfare reform and the lineitem veto — divide Senate Republicans, l b pass something, Mr.\nDole likely will have to water down\nHouse-passed legislation.\n\"There is an inherent contradiction between the message that has\nto go out to America and the things\n[Mr. Dole] has to do and say to keep\nhis merry little band together,\"\nsaid Paul Weyrich, a longtime Republican strategist and president\nof National Empowerment Television.\nMr Gramm, meanwhile, will\nhave the freedom to agitate for\nmore conservative alternatives in\na naked appeal for Republican primary voters.\n\"Primaries attract firebrands,\"\nMr. Weyrich said. \"Compromises\ndon't set those primary voters on\nfire.\"\nMr. Dole denied that pres-\nSenate vote test\nof his leadership\nIf it passes, Mr. Dole's stock as\na leader soars nationally and, most\nimportant, with Republican primary voters.\n\"If he wins it. Dole can use it as\na feather in his cap,\" said David\nKeene, president of the American\nConservative Union and a longtime Dole supporter. \"It would be\na major political victory for him.\"\nHis chief rival for the GOP\nnomination, Sen.

Mr.\n\"If we pass it, it's a\nhuge plus, dont get\nme wrong.\"\nidential politics are weighing on\nhis mind, and his supporters said\nhe would have delayed Tuesday's\nclimactic amendment vote whether he was running for president or\nnot.\n\"We're focused on winning this\nvote,\" Mr. Dole told The Washington Times. \"As far as I'm concerned, the balanced-budget\namendment has nothing to do with\npresidential politics and everything to do with helping the American people.\"\nRepublican strategists agree\nthat passing the amendment\nwould give Mr. Dole a potent new\nweapon against Mr. Gramm.\nFirst, he could hold up the\namendment as an example of leadership that led to passing popular\nlegislation with Republican and\nDemocratic support. This could\nthwart Mr. Gramm's applause line\nthat he killed the Clinton health\ncare bill by saying passage would\ncome \"over my cold, dead body.\"\n\"He can say it's not enough that\nwe just try to stop bad things,\" Mr.\nWeyrich said. \"He can say the real\ntest of leadership is putting across\ngood things. He can say, 'Where\nothers failed, I delivered.'\"\nBill Lacy, deputy chairman of\nthe Dole for President Exploratory Committee, said the majority\nleader doesn't need the amendment to prove his leadership skills\nor to foil Mr. Gramm's boasting\nGramm has pledged to cut spending and not raise taxes.\n\" If we pass the balanced-budget\namendment, we're going to profoundly change the whole complexion of the presidential campaign and who is prepared to make\nthe spending cuts needed to lead\nus to a balanced budget,\" Mr.\nGramm told The Washington\nTimes.\n\"The question will not be, when\nwill they do it? But how will they\ndo it? And who do you trust to cut\nspending rather than to raise\ntaxes, Phil Gramm or Bob Dole?\"\nMr. Gramm said.\nIf the amendment fails. Republican strategists agree that Mr.\nDole's reputation as a leader could\nsee DOLE, page A12\nabout killing health care.\n\"It was Bob Dole who went on\nnational television after the president's health care address and\nshowed that monstrous schematic\ndrawing of the plan's bureaucracy,\" Mr. Lacy said. \"And he's also\nperceived as being one of the people who stopped Bill Clinton from\nbringing big government to America.\"\nMr. Lacy sees the amendment\nas a win-win proposition for Mr.\nDole and of only passing interest\nto Mr. Gramm. If it passes, M r\nDole surges in the polls. If it loses,\nhe can go on the offensive against\nDemocrats.\n\"If we pass it, it's a huge plusj\ndon't get me wrong,\" Mr. Lacy said;\n\"If it doesn't pass, it's a tribute to\nhis leadership that it got this farj\nand he goes out and contrasts the\ndifference to the American people\nbetween the president and Senator\nDole.\"\nlb some, the most important issue for Mr. Dole is what comes\nafter the balanced-budget debate.\nGrover Norquist, president of\nAmericans for Tkx Reform, said\nMr. Dole and Mr. Gramm will have\nequal opportunity to carry a tough\nmessage against Democrats to penalize them for killing the amendment.\n\"You can't blame defeat on [Mr.\nDole] because Bill Clinton has\nmore clout with Democrats than\nBob Dole or Phil Gramm,\" Mr.\nNorquist said. \"The question is,\nwhat does he do with it? If he uses\nit as a mechanism to highlight\nwhere the Republican Party\nstands, he will benefit.

Mr. Clinton mentioned\nno one by name, although Senate\nMajority Leader Bob Dole earlier\nhad criticized Mr. Clinton's foreign\npolicies as timid.\n\"The new isolationists are\nwrong,\" said the president. \"They\nwould have us face the future\nalone.

If we withdraw from the\nworld today, we will have to contend with consequences of our neglect tomorrow.\"\nThe president, who proudly\ntouts his success in Haiti, Russia\nand on nuclear-arms accords, provided a long list of achievements\nand then said many weighty\nchores lie ahead.\n\"In this year of decision, our\nagenda is even more ambitious.

It's just that, sometimes,\nthey can look like one.\nKent Conrad and Byron L. Dorgan — born in North Dakota and\nschooled in the prairie populist\nstyle that both mastered in intertwining careers — have staked out\nsimilar positions on the balancedbudget amendment, whose fate\nnow rests in their hands.\nThe amendment is one vote shy\nof Senate passage, with both North\nDakotans holding out. A nod from\neither will do.\nNone of these parallels surprise\nfolks back home, who describe the\npair as friends and fellow populists who sometimes function like\npolitical bookends for their closeknit, rural state.\n\"In some ways contrasting is\ndifficult,\" said Ronald Pynn, a political science professor at the\nUniversity of North Dakota in\nGrand Forks. \"They're very similar. In fact, Kent Conrad is really\na protege of Byron Dorgan.\"\nAnd vice versa.\n\"They are each other's proteges,\" said Rep. Bill Oban, leader of\nthe state legislature's Democratic\nHouse minority.\nIndeed, the two have nurtured a\nsort of reciprocal rise to power.\nWhen Mr Dorgan made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in 1974,\nMr. Conrad managed the campaign. Mr. Dorgan, 52, was elected\nstate tax commissioner in 1968\nand served until 1980. Mr. Conrad,\n46, was his top assistant for six of\nthose years.\nWhen Mr Dorgan graduated to\nthe U.S. House in 1980, Mr. Conrad\nstepped into the tax commissioner's job.\nMr. Conrad beat his former boss\nto the Senate by challenging an incumbent in 1986. Mr. Dorgan followed in 1992.\n\"Kent and Byron are very close\nfriends,\" said Rep. Earl Pomeroy,\nNorth Dakota Democrat and the\nthird member of the state's congressional delegation. \"And I think\neach's success reflects how comfortable North Dakotans are with\nboth.\"\nBut Mr. Pomeroy said the two\nare not interchangeable.\n\"They make their decisions on\nan independent basis,\" he said.\n\"They have never run as each other's clone. I mean, Conrad is Conrad and Dorgan is Dorgan.\"\nColleagues describe both as\nthoughtful, intelligent, articulate\nand equally willing to break ranks\nwith the party, a posttfre that plays\nwell in North Dakota, a border\nstate with a population of 634,935,\nfourth-smallest in the nation.\n\"We are fiscally conservative,\nso the balanced-budget amendment would have a lot of support,\"\nMr. Pynn said. \"But we also have a\nlong streak of prairie populism. So.\nmavericks are not only tolerated,\nthey're celebrated.\"\n\"They're very much populists,\"\nagreed Mr. Oban. \"They very\nmuch understand people. . . . And\nthey're very consistent. It would\nbe easy for them to take the politically easy way out and vote for this\n[balanced-budget amendment] because polls show people want this.\"\nBoth have resisted that choice\n\"despite incredible pressure,\" Mr.\nOban said.\nThe two have been known to disagree. Mr. Conrad voted for the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and\nTVade. Mr. Byron voted against it.\nThe two also show differences in\npolitical style.\n\"Dorgan is a consummate campaigner,\" Mr. Pynn said. \"He\ncomes back to the state frequently,\nhas town hall meetings, rolls up his\nshirt sleeves and talks to farmers,\ngoes out to the small town cafes.\"\nMr. Conrad, he said, \"does not\nhave the same outgoing personal\nPhoto Oy Kenneth lamoert The Washington Tmes\nSen.

The\nagency estimates another $i.8 billion is lost each year from the overpayment of benefits.\nSpokesman Neal Flieger said\nthe USDA has already been working to solve the overpayment problem. He said fraud and abuse is a\nmore difficult problem to deal\nwith.\n\"It's a covert activity,\" he said.\n\"What happens between when a\nperson gets stamps and when the ,\nstamps are cashed in to us by the\nstores is something we can't know.\"\nOne of the ways the USDA\nwould try to monitor what happens\nto food stamps is by the use of the\nElectronic Benefit Transfer system. Under EBT, cpnsumers are\nissued \"Electronic Security\nCards,\" which allow them to use\nfood stamp money much like a\nbanking card.\nThe procedure leaves an electronic trail for the USDA to follow\nin search of traffickers. The USDA\nwants tp use that data to take action against.traffickers.\nEBT is in development in 41\nstates and is already being used\nstatewide in Maryland.\nThe USDA wants to couple increased monitoring with .stiffer\npenalities for abuse of food\nstamps. The proposed legislation\nwould allow the USDA to seize\nproperty used in or gotten from\nfood stamp violations of $5,000 or\nmore.\nFood stamp reform appears to\nhave a good chance of passing on\nCapitol Hill.\n\"We will possibly add it to the\nmarkup of our welfare reform\nbill,\" said a House Agriculture\nComminee staff member.\nThe food-stamp program was\n-eated under the Food Stamp\nan to aid families during the Deession in the 1930s.

King, director of the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM), Rep. John L.\nMica of Florida asked that groups\nnot directly benefiting human\nhealth and welfare be excluded\nfrom the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), the umbrella program that acts as distributor for\ndonations and provides the list of\nrecipients.\n\"The federal government can't\nbecome a collection agency for advocacy groups, whether they are\nof the left or the right,\" Mr. Mica,\na member of the House Government Reform and Oversight civil\nservice subcommittee, said in a\nseparate statement. \"It is a travesty to require taxpayers to subsidize the fund-raising efforts of political and ideological advocacy\ngroups.\"\nThe CFC was developed in 1961\nby President Kennedy to protect\nfederal employees from solicitations in the workplace.\nAnd an OPM official who requested anonymity noted, \"When\n[the CFC] was initially developed,\nit did say in the regulations that\nthe organizations where contributions would go were ones that directly provided human health and\nwelfare programs.\"\nIn 1993, the latest year for which\nsuch figures are available, the\nCFC collected nearly $200 million\nto be distributed among more than\n1,000 charities nationwide.\nA report issued in 1988 by a task\nforce on the CFC acknowledged\nthat the program is \"a subsidy for\nparticipating organizations,\" Mr.\nMica's statement said. The subsidy was estimated to be \"in the\nneighborhood of $55-$60 million\"\nper year.\n\"American taxpayers simply\nshould not be compelled to subsidize these advocacy groups,\" Mr.\nMica said.\nDuring the 1980s, President\nReagan tried to restrict participation in the CFC to traditional charities.

The center\nhas received $1,700 from the CFC\nin the past 18 months, said Executive Director Dan Noyes.\n\"We consider ourselves a combination of a journalism education\nprogram and a nonprofit independent source of journalism,\" Mr.\nNoyes said. \"A lot of people, particularly on the right, consider\nwhat we do advocacy.\"\nThe head of the Office of Personnel Management yesterday reassured members of the President's management council that\nphasing out OPM's investigations\n, office would not hurt their depart: ments' security operations.\nAt the closed-door meeting,\nJames B. King outlined the implications of his plan to privatize\nmuch of OPM's Office of Federal\nInvestigations by the end of the\nyear. The management council is\ncomposed of senior Cabinet department officials designated as\n' chief operating officers.\nMost federal agencies depend\non OPM to conduct background investigations, used for screening\nprospective employees and validating security clearances.\nUnder Mr. King's proposal,\nOPM would continue to issue policy guidance on investigations and\nwould retain control of the central\nrecords repository on all employees. But agencies would take responsibility for conducting background investigations, using\neither their own staff or contracting with private firms.\nSecurity officials at some departments have raised concerns\n; that eliminating the centralized investigations branch would , force\njevery agency to set up its own staff\niof investigators. Others fear that\nusing private investigators could\nhave serious national security repercussions.\nIn a Feb. 24 letter to OPM officials, the director of security for\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) wrote:\n\"FEMA has had experience in the\npast with contracting some of its\ninvestigations to private firms,\nand can emphatically state that it\nwas neither cost-effective nor efficient\nFrom a national security\nperspective, privatization of this\nfunction would surely weaken the\ncountry's susceptibility to security risks.\"\nOfficials at private security\nfirms dispute such fears, saying\nthey perform accurate and reliable investigations at half the\nprice of OPM's services. One company noted that its investigators\nare required to have at least five\nyears of prior federal experience,\nunlike OPM, which uses investigators right out of college with as\nlittle as two weeks of training.\nOPM will ask a private consultant to study the feasibility of an\nemployee stock ownership plan, or\nESOR Under that option, OPM\nwould help its employees set up a\nprivate company to conduct investigations. The feasibility study,\ndue out in mid-April, will include\na business plan for the private\ncompany, along with a survey of\nOPM investigators to assess the\nlevel of interest in such a venture.\nThe agency touts this proposal\nas a way to provide uninterrupted\nservice to the agencies it currently serves. \"OPM investigative\nstaff would be positioned to make\nthe transition from federal to a\nprivatized entity in a manner that\nwould be seamless to our customers — no service interruption.\"\n\" I f the ESOP is not possible, we\nwill have an out-of-business situation by the end of the year,\" the\nmeeting notes said. If formation of\na private company is found to be\nfeasible, however, OPM will develop legislation necessary to implement the plan.\nAn OPM spokesperson confirmed that investigations director\nPatricia Lattimore met with\nagency security officials last week\nto discuss their concerns.\n\"She assured them that the records repository and the central\ndata base are not going away,\nwhich was one of their biggest\nconcerns.\"\nNotes from last week's meeting,\nobtained by The Washington\nTimes, indicate that the Office of\nManagement and Budget estimates that privatizing investigations will save an estimated $30\nmillion.\n�Future of banking is now,\nRubin tells House panel\nBy Betsy Pisik\nTHE WASHINGTON TIMES\nH-easury Secretary Robert Rubin\nyesterday amplified and defended the\nClinton administration's proposal to\nease regulations on the nation's banks.\n\"The case for financial modernization has been made repeatedly over the\nyears in academic studies, government\nreports and congressional hearings,\"\nhe said in a three-hour appearance before the House Banking and Financial\nServices Committee. \"But most importantly, the case continues to be made\ndaily by the realities of the financial\nservices marketplace.\"\nThe administration's proposal — one\nof a trio circulating to overhaul portions of a restrictive 60-year-old banking law — would allow banks to join\nwith insurance companies, securities\nBallet beauties: what a\npulchritudinous feast at the\nAmerican Ballet Theatre's opening Hiesday night at the\nKennedy Center: the lithe grace\nof former Washingtonian Amanda McKerrow in the title role of\n\"Manon\" and the presence of\nfirst lady Hillary Rodham\nClinton, her daughter, Chelsea,\nand Hollywood's own Sharon\nStone.\nThe contrast in styles was palpable.

John J. \"Jimmy\" Duncan\nJr., Tennesse Republican and\nchairman of the House TVansportation and Infrastructure aviation\nsubcommittee, said that during\nhearings he may question Mr.\nPena about that contract as well as\nothers to his former company by\ncompanies tied to the Denver International Airport.\n\" I have no way of knowing if Mr.\nPena did anything wrong, but\nthere is at least the appearance of\nimpropriety,\" Mr. Duncan said. \"It\ndoesn't appear to me that this company would have gotten this contract unless it was close to Mr.\nPena.\"\nMr. Duncan said Mr. Pena called\nhim last week about the contract.\n\"He said he would be glad to come\nin and show me his records and\nexplain the whole thing,\" the congressman said.

Since\nhe took office Mr. Pena has committed $1.7 billion in federal\nmoney to the project.\nIn a statement released yesterday, Mr. Pena noted that he had\nreported on federal financialdisclosure forms in January 1993\nthat he sold his interest in the company at a loss.\n\"Before taking office, I completely severed all ties with my old\ninvestment firm, selling my interest in the company at a financial\nloss and recusing myself from any\nbusiness the firm had at that time,\"\nhe said. \" I have taken every\nappropriate measure within my\ncontrol to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest.\"\nMr. Pena's spokesman, Richard\nMintz, downplayed the Justice Department's decision to review the\ncontract. \"Any allegation Justice\nSecretary Federico Pena's old\nfirm won a S5 million contract.\nreceives they are obligated to pursue, including barking dogs,\" he\nsaid. \"We can find no allegations of\nillegal or unethical conduct.\"\nMr. Duncan said his aviation\nsubcommittee also is in the process of hiring former FBI investigators to examine suspicions of\nwrongdoing stemming from the\nhuge cost overruns involved in\nbuilding Denver's new airport.\nAmong the matters the subcommittee may review is how Pena Investment Advisers was given $10\nmillion to manage by USWest, a\nDenver-based telecommunications company. USWest contributed $200,000 to Mr. Pena's successful campaigns for mayor of\nDenver. It later won a $24 million\ncontract to put phones in the airport.\n\"Some of the things that went on\nwith the Denver Airport may be\nmore closely tied to Mr. Pena [than\nthe Los Angeles deal],\" Mr. Duncan said.\nJustice Department officials\nsaid a 30-day preliminary inquiry\nbegan in February into the deal\nbetween the Los Angeles transit\nand Pena Investment Advisers\nafter an article on the contract appeared in the Los Angeles Times.\nIf it finds specific, credible evidence that Mr. Pena may have violated federal law, the Justice Department then would conduct an\ninvestigation lasting up to 90 days\nto decide whether the charges\nwarranted appointment of an independent counsel.\nSy Jtttosfjinatmt fcime*\nte\n�THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1995\nSOMEONE TO WATCH OVER D .

She said then that the\nboard should only be around until\nthe city was back on solid financial\nfooting.\nBut most statutes establishing\nsuch boards require them to retain\nsome authority until all bonds,\nnotes or other loans involved in a\nbailout are fully paid.\nNew York's Municipal Assistance Corp., for example, was set\nup in 1975 to sell bonds and collect\nrevenues when the city dug itself\ninto an $8 billion deficit and its\nborrowing needs swamped bond\nmarkets.

Gertz\nTHE WASHINGTON TIMES\nDeployment of the Pentagon's\ncenterpiece missile defense system will violate the 1972 AntiBallistic Missile TVeaty unless the\npact is clarified with the Russians,\na senior arms control official says.\nJohn Holum, director of the U.S.\nArms Control and Disarmament\nAgency, says the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)\n\"can be tested, but its deployment\nwill create difficulties\" for ABM\nTreaty compliance.\nMr. Holum's remarks — made\nduring a luncheon meeting Tuesday with reporters and editors of\nThe Washington Times — reflect\nthe divergent views within the administration on the issue.\nThe Pentagon has set initial deployment for THAAD in 2001 and\nidentified it as one of three \"core\"\ntheater missile defense (TMD)\nprograms to be built in the next six\nyears.\nHowever, officials at ACDA and\nthe White House National Security\nCouncil and vice president's office\nare opposed to building any theater systems that might weaken\nthe ABM TY-eaty.\nThe CUnton administration informed the Russian government\nJan. 12 that it is going ahead with\n14 THAAD tests over two years,\ndespite ongoing talks with Moscow aimed at clarifying the ABM\nTt-eaty.\nThe talks are deadlocked over\nRussian insistence on restricting\nindividual components of U.S.\nanti-missile systems.\nA U.S. government official familiar with the compliance issue\nsaid Mr. Holum's remarks were\ncontrary to both the Pentagon and\nState Department views.\n\"The ABM TVeaty has always\nbeen interpreted as linking development, testing and deployment\n[of systems] as a single unit,\" the\naide said. \"You can't say testing is\napproved but deployment is not.\"\nPentagon and militarv officials\nare firmly against letting the\ntreaty interfere with efforts to\nbuild needed defenses against rhe\ngrowing threat of short-range missile attacks against U.S. troops and\ninterests overseas.\nThe White House National Security Strategy, released yesterday,\nsays the TMD talks with Russia\n\"reflect the administration's commitment to maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of crucial\narms agreements.\" The 33-page\ndocument makes only a passing\nreference to missile defenses.\nMr, Holum, a State Department\nofficial in the Carter administration and former aide to Sen.\nGeorge McGovern, said the U.S.\nside could not make a unilateral\ndeclaration to the Russians on its\nTMD programs without undermining the ABM TVeaty.\n\"Remember, there is a fundamental value to the ABM TVeaty in\nthe current context,\" he said. \"The\nABM TVeaty is likely to be fundamentally important to ratification in Russia of the START I I\ntreaty.\"\nRussian officials have made\ncontinuation of the ABM TVeaty a\nprecondition for \"further deep\nstrategic arms reductions\" after\nthe START I I treaty, which has\nbeen signed but not ratified, Mr.\nHolum said.\nMr. Holum also said the administration is not certain it will submit an agreement with Russia on\nthe theater missile defense issue\nto the Senate, as Senate leaders\nhave requested.\n\"Our position has been that we\nwill consult with the Senate and\nthat the form in this case follows\nsubstance,\" the ACDA director\nsaid. \"Until we have an agreement,\nwe won't know whether it's an\namendment to the treaty or not.\"\nA senior administration official\nsaid the problem with submitting\nthe treaty to the Senate is that it\nwould also require submission to\nthe legislatures of Russia, Ukraine\nand Belarus, which the Clinton administration has designated as\nABM . successors to the Soviet\nUnion.\nMr. Holum declined to discuss\nthe stalemated talks with the Russians but said \"the treaty needs to\nbe clarified\" and the issue of successor states is \"a matter of some\nconcern.\"\nThe objective of the talks is to\nproduce a \"dividing line\" between\nstrategic anti-missile systems, capable of knocking out ICBMs and\nother strategic missiles, and theater anti-missile systems used\nagainst short-range missiles, he\nsaid.\n\"We have not yet reached an\nagreement,\" Mr. Holum said.\n�Violation\nof no-fly\nzone\nreported\nNATO denies\nsupplying

But Russian diplomats\ncalled the NATO report unacceptable and said they will press\nfor an explanation when the Security Council meets tomorrow.\n\"We are by no means satisfied\nby what this investigation came up\nwith,\" a senior diplomat at Russia's\nU.N. mission said yesterday.\n\"We are still awaiting an explanation from the secretary-gen- 50\neral. If we do not get these explanations, we'll take a stance . . . to\nfind out what went on there.\"\nPeacekeepers have not reported\nseeing any planes land or drop 8\nweapons, though they were prevented by Bosnian government\ntroops from examining the ground\nunder the flights. The peacekeepers have based their speculation of cargo drops on the low altitude of the flights.\nNATO officials pledged yesterday to better inform the U.N. force\nin Bosnia of training missions and\nflights.

Refusal\nto grant certification would have\nforced a cutoff of aid and cooperation for Colombia.\nIn Bogota, the U.S. criticism\ndrew an indignant reaction from\nAttorney General Orlando Vasquez.\n\"No country in the world involved in drug-trafficking problems has paid a higher price in\nhuman sacrifice,\" he said, recalling the drug violence of the past\ndecade.\n\"The fundamental issue in Colombia is strong, serious law enforcement.

The act imposes an unreasonable paperwork burden on small and minority\nconstruction companies that do not\nhave personnel to comply with its\nrecord-keeping rules, and are therefore discouraged from bidding on\nfederal construction projects.\nDavis-Bacon impedes the growth\nof minority construction companies\nbecause their historical lack of\naccess to working capital limits their\ncapacity to compete for construction\nprojects on which prevailing wages\n(read: union wages) must be paid,\nwhich, in tum, minimizes their role\nin community development. DavisBacon's impact is particularly pernicious in low-income areas where\nthere is a high concentration of\nyoung, unskilled workers who are\nwilling to work for less than the prevailing wage on projects in their\nown communities and often in the\nvery public housing in which they\nlive. Davis-Bacon's mandated wages\nrender them unemployable because\na federal contractor is unlikely to\noffer work opportunities to unskilled\nworkers when he can hire a skilled\nworker for the same wage.\nThe grip that unions have on\nDemocratic politicians has ensured\nthe perpetuation of a regulatory\nscheme that restricts opportunities\nfor both minority construction companies and low-skilled workers.\nA rollback of Davis-Bacon regulations will unshackle minority construction companiesfromrules and\npaperwork that stifle competition\nfor federal construction projects.\nNow, that's one rollback that ought\nto find support among civil rights\norganizations.\nFAYE M.

Even if the child\nis with us every other weekend (26\nweekends a year), and two weeks\nfor vacation. Yet we are still expected to pay the support and in some\ncases, such as mine, also provide\nthe health care coverage, which\nisn't cheap under a two-party plan.\nI, too, think there should be more\nemphasis placed on the father helping to raise the child, but for those\nof us who are proud of of our children and more than willing to pay\nthe support, I think we should be\nable to enjoy the same tax breaks as\nthe parents who have custody when\nit comes to paying for support and\nhealth coverage.\nTHOMAS M.

But\n\"loser pays\" is a serious mistake in\nlegal reform.\nOur legal system is bleeding from\na thousand wounds of irrational\nprecedents, legislating from the\nbench and uncertainty as to what the\nlaws are. A \"loser pays\" bandage is\ninadequate tofixthe faults of our\nlaws, lawyers and courts.\nWe don't have legal problems\nbecause people initiate frivolous\nlawsuits.

When the\ngavel sounds, we think we know\nwho was the frivolous party,\nresponsible for absurd lawsuits: the\nparty who lost.\nThis is a sad fantasy. Dont assume\ncourts give correct results. It is\ncharming that American have that\nmuch faith in judges, courts and\nlawyers but there is no reason to\nthink a party loses due to being\nwrong.\n\"Loser pays\" is more like spinning a roulette wheel, disregarding\nright and wrong.

Everett Koop\nserved in this offlce, it has become\nclear that the main function of the\nT\nations before 1974. the sterilization\nof four healthy but mentally retarded women.\nBut this has just reinforced the\nstrong feelings about Dr. Foster: It\nhas associated abortion with\nfurtiveness, evasiveness, and an\napparently casual attitude about\ninvoluntary sterilization.\nDr. Foster is not going to be surgeon general, but his nomination\nhas accomplished two things: It\nassures us that the next surgeon\ngeneral will be someone who has no\nrecord of performing abortions,\nand it opens the door to the use of\nstigma as an organized anti-abortion tactic.\nStigma doesn't get very good\npress in America. The left keeps\ninsisting it is an attempt by the powerful to assail the behavior of the\npowerless. But the left conducts\nstigma campaigns of its own all the\ntime — against smoking tobacco\nand wearing wearing fur, for example. We are on the brink of a broad\neffort torestigmatizeeasy divorce\nand the intentional bearing of children out of wedlock. Why not a\ncampaign to stigmatize something\neven more dubious: solving a problem by killing a developing form of\nhuman life?\nSome anti-abortion activists have\nbeen pursuing a stigma policy by\npublicizing the- names of abortion\ndoctors. Nothing wrong with that,\nunless the effort veers over into the\nharassment of families and threats\nagainst doctors' lives. It's probably\ntrue that many doctors have\nstopped performing abortions out\nof fear of quasi-terrorist tactics\nagainst them. But many more doctors are shying away because of the\nstigma.\nThe truth is that abortion is generating a generally bad odor in\nthe medical profession, in large\npart because doctors understand\nvery well that it is a morally dubious procedure. Dr. Ralph Hale,\nexecutive director of the American\nCollege of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists, estimates that\nmore than half of the group's\n35,000 members have performed\nabortions in the past, but only a\nthird are doing abortions now.\nThat would be roughly 5,000 OBGYNs who have stopped doing\nabortions. Some are older doctors\nwith patients past their childbearing years. But these older doctors\nare not being replaced by younger\nones as eager to do abortions. Is\nthis because they are all terrified\nof anti-abortion violence, or is the\nshame of performing this operation beginning to take a heavier\ntoll?\nThe current effort by prochoicers to force medical students\nto learn how to perform abortions\nis a way of saying that the money to\nbe made in performing abortions is\nnot drawing enough doctors into\nthe field.\nAnti-abortion forces would be\nbetter off abandoning harassment\nat the clinics and the futile efforts\nto get an anti-abortion amendment\nor Supreme Court ruling. What we\nneed is steady moral pressure, built\naround stigma, toreducethe number of abortions and to depict abortion as a primitive form of violence\nthat society will eventually outgrow,\njust as it outgrew infanticide and\nslavery.\nThis would mean no state funds\nat all for abortion, and no more\nstate-supported abortion festivals\nlike the population conference in\nCairo. The state would have to stay\ntotally neutral, and not pretend, as\nit did in the foolish Poster nomination, that the issue is somehow\nbehind us.\nThe public's resistance\nto Dr. Foster is based\non a very simple\npremise: that an\nadministration stacks\nthe deck in favor of\nabortion when it\nnames an abortionist\nto a job known\nprimarilyfor its moral\npreaching.\noffice of surgeon general is moral\nexhortation. On the basis of popular reaction to this nominee, the\nnation wants its medical preaching\ndone by someone who comes to the\njob with cleaner hands than Henry\nFoster.\nProponents of abortion have\nbeen blindsided by this, largely\nbecause they came to believe\ntheir own press releases that only\na tiny fringe of \"out of the mainstream,\" \"anti-choice\" zealots still\nresist the hardening pro-abortion\nconsensus.\nWhat the pro-choicers rarely\nacknowledge is that the nation is\nmuch more troubled than that\nabout abortion. Depending on how\nthe pollsters frame their questions, up to 75 percent of Americans have moral objections to\nabortion on demand. Because\nDonna Shalala and her staff don't\nseem to know any of these people,\nthey think what everyone in their\ncircle thinks: Abortion is a nonissue now.\nThis is a bit like the embarrassment suffered by The Washington\nPost when it failed to notice a huge\nanti-abortion rally a few blocks\naway because nobody on staff\nseemed to know anyone who\nplanned to attend. In some tight little circles, it takes a huge act of\nimagination to notice what the rest\nof America thinks.\nThe public's resistance to Dr.\nPoster is based on a very simple\npremise: that an administration\nstacks the deck in favor of abortion\nwhen it names an abortionist to a\njob known primarily for its moral\npreaching.\nThis reaction has been obscured,\nin part, by Dr. Foster's apparent\ninability to come clean on the numJohn Leo is a contributing ediber of abortions he has performed, tor of U.S.News & World Report\nand by the news that he performed and a nationally syndicated\nsome other ethically dubious oper- columnist.\n�Affirmative wedging and hedgin\nBEN WATTE1VBERG\nt's time for the W-word,\nagain, but with a Clintonesque twist.\nIn Canada last week, President Clinton (according to\nthe New York Times)\n\"acknowledged . . . that he had\nordered areviewof [his] administration's support for affirmative\naction programs.\" Indeed, said the\npresident; \"We shouldn't be defending things we can't defend.

The first lady was\nbreathless with concern over choosing just the right color of blue so that\nit would create a \"blue feeling\" but\nnot be so dark as to shrink the room\nin the evening shade.\nShe had a \"great deal of fun,\"\nreplacing drab draperies and tired\ncarpets in the room that was the\nfirst formal state room for President James Madison. Small wonder\nthat Hillary has found renewed\nrespect for Dolley Madison: \"She\nhad a lot of spunk.\"\nCan this be the same first lady\nwho communed with Eleanor Roosevelt only two years ago when she\nfirst moved to Washington?

(Like little rocks\nfrom Arkansas, no doubt.)\nIt's easy to feel her pain. She has\nnone of the aristocratic chic that\nmade Jackie Kennedy comfortable\nin redecorating the White House\nshe lived in, and it seems unfair to\ntrot out this very modern first lady\nlike a latter-day Betty Furness,\nabout to open a refrigerator door.\nFew critics of Hillary Clinton's\nassertion and assumption of power\nas a policy-maker without account-\nHillary hasfound\nrenewed respectfor\nDolley Madison.\nability, would have suggested that\nshe imitate Dolley Madison, or\nJackie Kennedy, or even Nancy\nReagan, all women whose roles\nwere comfortably carved out of\ncareful attention to decorating\ndetails over the years of their pasts.\nSurely there's something for a\nfirst lady to do short of overhauling\nthe health care system and redecorating the White House. Hillary\nsays she still intends to encourage\nwomen on Medicare to get mammograms, to bring attention to the\nillnesses of military veterans. But\nthis is clearly a first lady whose\nwings have been clipped with an\noversized scissors.\nWe can expect that future first\nladies will learn from Hillary's onthe-job experience, but it's difficult\nto know what we can expect from\nthe women whose husbands are\nentered in what the pundits insist\non calling a horse race. (Jackie\nKennedy always thought \"first\nlady\" sounded like a saddle horse.)\nWendy Lee Gramm, with her\nthree-ply name (her surname, Lee,\nis the most famous name not only in\nKorea but in a sweep of important\nstates from Virginia to Tfexas) is\nevery bit as formidable as Mrs.\nClinton, but her style (and substance) is as different from the current first lady as Phil Gramm's is\nfrom the president.\nLike Hillary, she attended\nWellesley, three years earlier. She\nwent on to get a doctorate in economics at Northwestern and taught\nat Ibxas A&M, while raising her two\nsons. She gave birth during summer sessions. She told the Women's\nQuarterly: \"Academics lends itself\nto combining activities.\"\nUnlike Hillary, she didn't deal in\ncommodity futures, but she was\nchairman of the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission during Bush\nand Reagan administrations. Unlike\nthe Clintons, the Gramms share\ntheir belief in afree-marketeconomy, but if her husband becomes\npresident Mrs. Gramm plans to kibbitz not to advise: \" I don't want an\nofficial job in government; I'm\nretired from \"government.\"\nPhil Gramm, who told me the\nother day over lunch that he has\nnever criticized the current first\nlady, calls Wendy the most important person in his life. \"But I don't\nthink my wife sees herself as some\nkind of surrogate president. People\nbelieve they elect the president, not\nthe president's family.\"\nNevertheless, I think I know what\nWendy Lee Gramm would do about\nthose little rocks in the East Room.\n�DON FEDER\nPutting official language on our lips\nH\nere's a totally rad idea:\nMake the language of the\nDeclaration of Independence and US. Constitution — the language in which congressional debate takes place and\nthe language spoken by most Americans throughout our history — the\nofficial language of the United\nStates.\nThat's the objective of the National Language Act of 1995, filed last\nweek by Rep. Peter King, New York\nRepublican. Besides the ceremonial designation of English, the measure would abolish federal subsidies for bilingual education and\nprohibit printing federal documents, including ballots, in any\nother language.\nIt would strike a blow against\nthe linguistic separatism that's\nbecoming a feature of daily life in\nmulticultural America, where you\ncan graduate from high school, get\na driver's license, pay your taxes\nand vote without knowing a word of\nthe mother tongue.\nIn a country of many religions,\nraces and ethnic groups, English is\nour social adhesive. When a\nnation's people can no longer speak\nto each other, they often resort to\nnonverbal communication — witness Bosnia.\nThe federal government subsidizes bilingual education to the tune\nof $254 million annually. More than\n2 million children are in bilingual\nclasses, learning everything from\nart to science in every language\nfrom Arabic to Russian.\nWhat was meant as a transition\nfor immigrants and their children\nhas turned into a ghetto from which\nmany never escape. A 1994 study\nby the New York City Board of Education documented the bankruptcy\nof bilingualism. An American education system that stops educating\nstudents to be Americans has failed\nin its most essential function.\nStudents who graduate unable to\nread their diplomas can proceed to\nvote in elections where they can't\nunderstand stump speeches or\nmost political advertising.\nUnder a 1992 extension of the\nVoting Rights Act, bilingual election\nmaterial must be provided in districts where more than 5 percent of\nthe population or more than 10,000\nare foreign-language speakers. In\n1993, Los Angeles county spent\n$125,250 for election information in\nSpanish, Vietnamese, etc. Only\n3,264 voters actually availed themselves of this option.\nFor the first time last year, the\nInternal Revenue Service printed a\nhalf-million tax forms in Spanish\n(at a cost of $113,000). Less than\n1,000 were used. When ethnic pandering is the goal, cost is no obstacle.\nIncreasingly, bilingualism bor-\nders on coercion. The Tfexas Public\nUtilities Commission is considering\na rule to require utilities to employ\nSpanish-speaking\noperators,\nrepairmen and linemen.\nThe rule would make it difficult\nfor Americans who speak only English to get a job in the industry.\nAnglo Tfexans would be better off if\nthe state were still part of Mexico.\nThen, Santa Anna's successors\ncould cater to them.\nMore than 40 states give driver's\ntests in languages other than English. Some even provide interpreters for road tests. Can street\nsigns in Tbgalbg be far off?\nM\njobs program. Ethnic activists\nwould prefer that their constituents\nnever learned English. In this way,\nthey can maintain their status and\npower as liaisons between immigrants and the political establishment. It alsoflattersactivists' group\npride to think the country must\naccommodate them.\nAnd bilingualism perfectly fits\nthe multicultural agenda, which\ndespises the melting pot analogy.\nWhat better way to demonstrate\nour lack of unity and national purpose — to deconstruct America as\na white, European nation — than\nwith language Balkanization?\nPre-bilingualism, America\nworked. Our success can be seen in\nthe fact that the two organizations\npushing official English (U.S. English and English First) are headed\nrespectively by Mauro Mujica, an\nengineer who came here from\nChile 30 years ago, and George\n\"n-yfiates, the son of a Greek immigrant.\nIf bilingualism had been the rule\nat the turn of the century, this\ngrandson of Jewish immigrants\nwouldn't be writing a political column. Once, English turned a nation\nof immigrants into a nation of\nAmericans. It can again.\nost immigrants reject this\nmisplaced compassion. In a\n1990 Houston Chronicle\npoll, 87 percent of Hispanics surveyed said it was their \"duty to\nlearn English.\"\nImmigrant parents want their\nchildren to have the language tools\nfor social mobility. In his book,\n\"Straight Shooting,\" Boston University President John Silber offers\na bitter commentary from a Mexican-born ranch hand: \"My children\nlearn Spanish in school so they can\ngrow up to be busboys and waiters.\nI teach them English at home so\nthey can grow up to be doctors and\nlawyers.\"\nBut bilingualism has its fans.

One interracial couple\nin Seattle sent her a picture of their\nfamily, which included Hispanic,\nKorean and Eskimo children that\nthey had adopted. They urged her to\nfight hard to save Billy.\nIt is one of the small but important signs of progress that there are\nmore such families today than any of\nus would have dreamed of jdst a\nquarter-century ago. I have encountered a number of families that have\nadopted minority children — and\nnone of these children have suffered\nany of the horrors dreamed up by\nsocial workers, \"identity\" experts\nand miscellaneous race hustlers.\nA pediatrician in St. Louis sent a\nlong letter to Stuart Oppenheim,\ndirector of the youth and family services division, pleading with him not\nto ruin this child's life by tearing\nhim out of the only home he has. But\nit made no difference. The San\nMateo County Department of Social\nServices insisted on going forward\nwith its attempt to take Billy away,\neven though they had no better alternative to offer him than institutional care.\nMr. Oppenheim said \"a transracial placement\" can \"create for an\nadolescent a terrible identity crisis.\" But apparently all will be\npeaches and cream if you just snatch\nhim out of his home and throw him\nin with a bunch of strangers.\nIf Mr. Oppenheim truly believes\nthat, then we might at least feel\nsorry for him. But cases like this are\nnot usually about different beliefs\nbut about the ugly politics of race\nand the culture of resentment that\nhas grown up around it.\nKing Solomon understood, thousands of years ago, that anyone who\nwould tear a child apart to make a\npoint was not a real mother. It is\ntruly tragic if Mr. Oppenheim does\nnot understand the same principle\ntoday. But all this is not just one\nman's doing.\nBehind such callous bureaucratic policies are organized groups of\nblack social workers who have successfully intimidated social service\nagencies across the country into\npreventing black children from finding homes with white families.\nThose who wear their \"blackness\"\nlike a chip on their shoulder do not\nhesitate to sacrifice a black child to\nscore a point against whitey.\nUnfortunately, Billy was not\nT\n1\nBilly\nis all\nright\nunique in being a target for those\nwho put dogmas above human\nbeings. What was unusual was that\nit didn't work this time.\nAt this moment, social welfare\nofficials in Denver are trying to yank\na Hispanic child out of a foster home\nwhere a white couple have raised\nhim from early infancy to age 5.\nSince the bureaucrats cannot find a\nHispanic home for him in Denver,\nthey want to send him to Fort Collins,\nmore than 60 miles away, to an unrelated Hispanic family. That means\nhe may lose contact with every child\nand every adult that he has ever\nknown in his life.\nIn New Jersey, an interracial\ncouple — black wife, white husband — are trying to adopt a black\nchild, and the New Jersey bureaucrats are fighting them.\nMake no mistake about it, the\nracial resenters are determined to\nget their own way, and are\nunscrupulous about how they do it.\nThey have no facts to back up their\nclaims, but they don't rely on facts.\nThey rely on intimidation and\nunderhanded maneuvers.\nAny white official who stands in\ntheir way can expect to be called a\n\"racist,\" even though it is the social\nworkers who are hyping race. And\nif intimidation does not work, trickery often will.\nLast year, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum introduced a bill in Congress\nto stop all this interference with\ntransracial adoptions. But by the\ntime the bill came to a vote, it had\nbeen so sabotaged with new provisions that it has actually made it\nharder than before to adopt a child\nof a different race.\nAmong those fighting for these\nchildren's needs to take precedence\nover racial dogmas is Professor\nRita Simon of American University, who has just helped found the\nAdoptions Studies Institute. Now\npeople who want to know the facts,\ninstead of the strident rhetoric, will\nhave a place to turn to.\nThe Institute for Justice, headed\nby Clint BoUck in Washington, is\nlooking into the legal issues to see\nwhat can be done to help these children who need homes, not ideology.\nLet us rejoice for Billy — and\nthen see what can be done for\nother minority youngsters who still\nneed a home and have not been so\nlucky.\nThomas Sowell, an economist\nand a senior fellow at the Hdover\nInstitution, is a nationally syndi\ncated columnist.\n:\n�-JHVRSDAY.

Last year, then-Secretary of\nLicensing and Regulation William Fbgel took upon\nhimself the awesome and compassionate responsibility of caring for the humble folk of his state by issuing a bureaucratic decree banning smoking in all\nworkplaces — inclyding private bars and restaurants, private hotel rooms, offices, factories and corner pool parlors. A court ruling found that the decree\nwas improperly issued and held it up, and most people forgot about it. Now, another state court has resurrected it, and the ban will go into effect in 30 days.\nThat's what happens when people forget\nWhat is curious about the ban is that not a single\nsoul in the state was allowed to vote on it — not the\ncitizens, not the state legislators, not the consumers\nwho want to smoke or who do or don't care about\nsmoking, not the private merchants whose businesses may be harmed by it. As in \"The Wizard of\nOz,\" nobody gets to see the wizard, not no way, no how.\nOf course, this is not \"The Wizard of Oz\" but \"Alice\nin Wonderland,\" wherefictionis truth and the impossible happens frequently. The smoking ban is based\non the supposition, trumpeted by anti-smoking propagandaforseveral years, that \"passive smoke\" is.\nharmful to those exposed to it. Never mind that the\n\"studies\" that supposedly prove that claim have been\ndiscredited as havingreliedon unscientific and tendentious methodologies. Never mind that those who\ndislike tobacco smoke or who may be harmed by exposure to it can always avoid places where it is common\nor ask politely those who are smokingtorefrain out\nof courtesy. In the new Wonderland, courtesy has no\nmore place than democracy or valid science.\nCritics of the ban, including a coalition of small\nbusinessmen whose restaurants and bars could be\nruined by the exodus of smoking customers, were\ninstrumental in bringing the legal action that temporarily halted its implementation, but neither Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. nor the\nanti-smoking battalions were interested in what the\npeople who actually have to live with the ban had to\nsay. \"Waiters and waitresses,\" intoned Mr. Curran the\nother day, \"people who carry food and drink to the\ntables in small restaurants, they're entitled to the\nsame protection as people in bigger businesses.\" Mr.\nCurran was inveighing against the prospect of Gov.\nParris Glendening modifying the ban to exempt\nsmall restaurants and tavems. As Mr. Curran would\nhave it, nobody gets exempted, not no way, no how.\nBut Mr. Curran's solicitude for \"waiters and waitresses\" who might catch a snoutful of tobacco aroma\nwhen they serve the tables is a pretense. If waiters\nand waitresses are concerned about their exposure,\nthey can probably arrange to serve tables in the nonsmoking section (which virtually all restaurants\nhave already). Even if they can't so arrange and even\nif exposure to passive smoke were proved to be\nharmful, how much exposure do waiters and waitresses get? If Mr. Curran is so worried about the waiters and waitresses, why doesn't he let them vote on\nthe ban?\nThe implications of what the state government—\nthe unelected bureaucrats, the judges, the attorney\ngeneral, and the governor — have done reach far\nbeyond this particular decree, however. In the first\nplace, if the state can ban smoking in private workplaces (including hotel rooms, on the grounds that\nmaids who make the beds might be affected by last\nnight's orgy of smoking), why can't it ban smoking\nin private homes (on the grounds that the Maytag\nrepairman might contract cancer if he gets a whiff\nof your cigar)? In the second place, if it can ban smoking, why can't it ban anything else it doesn't like?\nThe old-fashioned answertothe latter question is\nthat, well, of course the voters wouldn't allow it to.\nBut what this ban shows is that in Maryland the voters don't determine such matters anymore. If Maryland voters are smart, they'll do something about this\nand demand a vote, on the ballot or at least in the legislature, before the ban can go into effect, and thereby make sure that this kind of government by decree\ncan't happen here, not no way, no how.\n�This land's not their land\nAt a time when when aging couples tremble under doing so.

They claim the United States and\nother nuclear powers are hypocritical and seeking to\ncement a nuclear double-standard.\nAt the same forum, named in honor of former President\nRichard IA. Nixon, Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of\nKansas accused Clinton of conducting a misguided \" Yeltsin\nfirst\" policy in Russia, implying it led to the loss of\nlife'in the rebellious republic of Chechnya.\nClinton's attack on isolationism in the Republican\nParty and Dole's counterpunch at the president's Russian\npolicy put foreign policy in the middle of a fierce\npolilical arena that has, until now, largely focused on\ndomestic policy.\nThe president used the power of his office by ordering\nthe removal of 200 tons of fissile material, enriched\nuranium and plutonium, from the stockpile used to make\nweapons. This would be enough to make thousands of nuclear\nweapons and represents a \"significant reduction\" in the\nstockpile, according to senior administration officials.\nNoting that the expiring non-proliferation treaty marks\nits 25.th anniversary this week, Clinton said, \"nothing is\nmore important to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons\nthan extending-the treaty indefinitely and\nunconditionally.\"\nThe treaty must be reviewed by all 171 countries that\nhave pledged to abide by its restrictions. The Clinton\nadministration concedes it is at least 17 votes shy of the\nmajority it needs to make the treaty permanent.\nSome countries point out that the United States and\nother nuclear powers still control huge stockpiles of\nnuclear material and weapons, and should do more to reduce\nthem. Others favor an extension of the treaty, but for a\nlimited time.\nWhile uranium can be used for power reactors, plutonium\ncan't be destroyed and would have to be stored,\nadministration officials conceded. But one senior\nadministration official said, \"When you take the material\nto make nuclear weapons out of the stockpile, it makes it\nimpossible for it to be used again in weapons.\"\nNational Security Adviser Anthony Lake expressed hope\nthat the president's initiative would help persuade other\ncountries to go along with indefinite extension of the\ntreaty. Officials said the United States wouldn't\ncompromise over the permanent extension and that 60 to 70\ncountries of the 87 necessary to make it permanent favored\nthe indefinite extension.\nIn his speech, Clinton also said the non-proliferation,\ntreaty was a major example of the need for U.S. engagement\nin the world.\n\"Arms control makes us both safer and stronger,\" he\nsaid. \" I t is one of the most effective insurance policies\nwe can write for the future.\"\n(EDITORS: STORY CAN TRIM HERE)\nThe president called 1995 a year \" i n which the United\nStates will pursue the most ambitious agenda to dismantle\nand fight the spread of weapons of mass destruction since\nthe atom was split.\"\nThe president said the \"new isolationists, both on the\nleft and right, would radically revise the fundamentals of\nour foreign policy that have earned bipartisan support\nsince World War II.\"\nHe said they would eliminate any role for the United\nNations and U.N. peacekeeping efforts, deny foreign aid lo\nfledging democracies and trumpei ihe rhetoric of American\nstrength while denying resources that would make America\nstrong.\n\"We must not let the ripple of isolationism they have\ngenerated build intoia tidal wave,\" he said.\nLake told reporters earlier that Clinton was referring\nchiefly to Republicans in the House and that isolationism\ncould be contained in the Senate.\nBut Dole, a candidate for president in the 1996\ncampaign, showed that an internationalist like himself\ncould pose a major challenge to Clinton on foreign policy.\nHe said Russia's policies, from North Korea, to\nYugoslavia, to Iran, were \"often in conflict with\nAmerican interests.\" Just as it was wrong for President\nGeorge Bush to place loo much faith in Soviet President\nMikhail Gorbachev, it is now wrong for Clinton to put so\nmuch faith in Yeltsin, Dole said.\n\"The Clinton's administration's misguided devotion to\na Russia First' policy which has turned into a 'Yeltsin\nFirst' policy resulted in the loss of a tremendous\nopportunity to state American concerns forcefully before\nthousands were slaughtered in Chechnya,\" Dole said.\nHe called upon Clinton to develop a more realistic,\nhonest relationship with Russia. In response, Lake said\nClinton had spoken out against the war in Chechnya and\ndenied the United States was pursuing a Russian first or\nYeltsin first policy.\n\"Chechnya has started to drive a wedge between\nPresident Yeltsin and some of the reformers,\" Lake said.\n\"In our view, it is important that we act in a way that\nmakes it easier rather than harder for Yeltsin and the\nreformers to come together again. ...\"\nDole also warned against the United States falling into\na false sense of security even if the non-proliferation\ntreaty was extended indefinitely. When Iraq's nuclear,\nambitions became clear after the Gulf War, he said, the\nadministration dispatched U.N. Ambassador Madeleine\nAlbright to Europe to plead for cooperation in putting\npressure on Iraq. \"Where would such timidity have gotten\nus in the Cold War?\" he asked.\nLake fired back that Dole's statement was \"simply\nunfounded on the facts.\" He said Albright's mission was\nto give members of the U.N. Security Council a tough\nmessage that the United Stales would insist on sanctions\nagainst Iraq as long'as it violated U.N. resolutions.\n�School food service officials fear consequences of\nfederal bill By Rachel L. Jones Knight-Ridder\nNewspapers\nWASHINGTON In Richmond, Calif., where Heidy\nCamorongan is administrator of food services for the local\nschool district, children start lining up at 6 a.m. during summer\nmonths for free breakfast.\nUnder a change in federal school nutrition programs now\nbefore the House of Representatives, her West Contra\nCosta Unified School District, with its high percentage of\npoor black, Latino, Laotian and Vietnamese children, would\nprobably have to end that program and drastically cut back\non the fresh fruits and vegetables in the 17,000 daily\nmeals it provides.\n\"1 did the numbers, and, under this bill, I'd have to\ncome up with a half-million dollars extra for next year,\"\nCamorongan said. \" I don't think they understand just what\nwe're up against.\"\nCamorongan and other members of the American School\nFood Service Association shared their frustrations about\nthe House bill, known as HR 999, at the group's annual\nlegislative conference here. These are the people who feed\nmillions of schoolchildren each day. For them, the House\nbill intended to combine federal school nutrition programs\ninto state block grants is a disaster waiting to happen.\nUnder the bill, part of the Republican Contract With\nAmerica's welfare-reform package, school breakfasts,\nlunches and child care meals would be combined with such\nprograms as supplemental nutrition for Women, Infants and\nChildren, or WIC. One grant to the states would cover\nschool meals and the other would cover all remaining\nchild-nutrition programs and WIC.\nThe bill currently calls for annual increases of 4.5\npercent over five years in the amount of money for the\nblock grants, and backers say this would mean more money\nfor school meals. But ASFSA members say the bill doesn't\nallow for inflation or for the possibility of increased\nparticipation in food programs during a recession.\nWhile the focus of the debate is on free meals for poor\nstudents, school administrators say that, because all\nschool meals arc subsidized, the House bill would affect\ntheir ability to feed all students. Slightly more than\nhalf the 25 million schoolchildren get free or cut-price\nmeals, costing $5 billion a year, according to the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture.\nThe federal move toward block grants is touted by\nRepublicans as a way to cut bureaucracy and allow states\nto decide the best ways to serve residents. But ASFSA\nmembers have little confidence that already-overburdened\nstates will help them perform their complex, daily\njuggling act of providing nutritious meals to America's\nstudents, poor or otherwise.\nThey fear that block grants will ultimately mean less\nmoney for school lunches. In the first year, states would\nreceive money based on the number of meals provided the\nyear before. After that, money would be based on the\nnumber of meals served compared with those served in other\nstates.\n\"You'd have a situation where states might be tempted\nto cut back on meals or to lower nutritional standards to\nsave money and compete for more funds,\" said Vivian\nPilant, president of the association and state director of\nschool food service for South Carolina.\nIn ending the school lunch program, she said, the\ngovernment would no longer require schools to meet a\nnutritional standard, and states could decide what\nconstitutes a healthy meal.\nWhen the school lunch program was cut back in the\n1980s, Pilant said, 1,000 schools stopped providing meals.\nShe and other association members estimated thousands more\ncould drop out this time around.\n(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)\nGene White, the association's special legislative\nliaison, said not just the poor would be hit hard by the\ncuts. Under the bill, 80 percent ol\" block grant money must\nbe used for poor children defined as those whose family\nincome is less than 185 percent of the poverty level. White\nsays the definition doesn't include all the children who\nneed help paying for school lunches.\n\"You're talking about a lot of working poor families\nwho are just barely getting by,\" she says. \"Two dollars\na meal may not sound like much to a family that's well\noff, but when you're just making ends meet, you can't come\nup with the extras.\"\nGovernors could spend ihe remaining 20 percent of their\ngrants as they sec fit, oven on programs that don't\nprovide food, and food service association members think\nthey will.\n(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)\nThe 800-plus members from schools nationwide said they\nwould go home and write legislators and rally parents\nagainst the bill. \" Y o u have io be willing to fight for\nthe future of America's children and for what you believe\nto be a real danger lo ihem,\" While House Chief of Staff\nLeon Panetta told them.\nCamorongan said her impossible job would be even harder\nbecause of an amendment lo the bill this week in which\nschools could not use block-grant funds lo feed children\nof illegal immigrants.\n\"Are we supposed to go through the lunch line and ask\nkids i f they're legal before we take away their trays?\"\nshe said. \"We are there to feed children, and yet all\nthis bill will do is make sure that we can't.\" .\nDEA clears agent accused of taking bribe from\nMedellin drug lord By Jeff Leen and Gerardo\nReyes Knight-Ridder Newspapers\nM I A M I An internal review by the U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration has concluded that a Colombian drug\ninformant lied when he accused a DEA agent of accepting\n$25,000 to import a luxury car for a Medellin cartel drug lord.\nDEA's Division of Inspections rejected the story told\nby the informant, Gabriel Taboada, a convicted drug dealer\nwho testified for the government at the 1992 drug trial of\nGen. Manuel Noriega.\nTaboada alleged lasi September that he paid a middleman\nin 1986 to give DEA agent William Michael Aldridge $25,000\nto use his diplomatic privileges to import a Mercedes-Benz\n230 station wagon into Colombia for Gustavo Gaviria,\ncousin of top cartel boss Pablo Escobar.\n\" I n this case we did establish a number of\ndiscrepancies and inconsistencies in Taboada's statements\nand allegations,\" said DEA Chief Inspector Johnny Phelps.\n\"Wc fully documented every stage of the purchase,\nownership and sale of the vehicle.\"\nAldridge told The Miami Herald he felt vindicated by\nthe DEA's review of the matter.\n\"I'm happy the investigation's over,\" Aldridge said.\n\" I t really kind of gave me a bad lime for the last three\nmonths. I don't know why the guy did it. A l l I can say is\nthe guy's lying, whatever his motives arc.\"\nBut Taboada told The Herald he stands by his account\ndespite the DEA's findings. His attorney, John Mattes of\nMiami, called the DEA review a \"whitewash.\"\n\"Why are they so quick lo rush to judgment to protect\ntheir own?\" said Mattes, a former investigative counsel\nfor the U.S. Senate. \"Why don't ihcy do a complete and\nthorough investigation.'\n�\"It's deeply disturbing to me that the DEA has chosen\nto ignore the truth regarding criminal activity in the\nU.S. Embassy.\"\nIn the past, Taboada has been a key witness for the\nDEA. His testimony was crucial to Noriega's conviction on\nfederal drug charges in Miami, a case that has been called\nthe most important in DEA history.\nNow the DEA says it believes that Taboada is distorting\nthe truth because he is bitter about serving a 12-year\nfederal prison despite his previous testimony for the DEA.\n\"We do feel that (Taboada) was lying,\" Phelps said\nAldridge, who retired from the DEA after 30 years of\ngovernment serv ice in December, served as the DEA's\nassistant country attache in Colombia from 1985 to 1988.\n\"I've never ever knowingly done anything to help or\nassist any traffickers in my life,\" he said. \" A n d I\ncertainly never took any bribe or gift or anything. The\nonly thing I've ever done is put those bastards in jail.\"\nLast fall, Taboada told The Herald in several\ninterviews that Aldridge provided cover for the cartel's\npurchase of the Mercedes.\nTaboada said that Aldridge had the car in his\npossession for only a few months before it was driven to\nMedellin and added to the cartel's carpool.\nThe DEA began investigating Taboada's story after The\nHerald obtained a Colombia customs manifest from July 1986\nshowing that Aldridge had imported a Mercedes-Benz 230\nstation wagon valued at $17,360 from Stuttgart, Germany,\nto Santa Marta, Colombia.\nA DEA official familiar with the review said that\nAldridge provided the DEA with a copy of a notarized\ncontract showing that he raised the money lo purchase the\nMercedes from two friends who worked in English-speaking\nforeign embassies in Colombia.\nThe two friends supported Aldridge's account in\nseparate telephone interviews, the DEA official said. The\nDEA refused to identify the two friends.\nAldridge planned lo hold onto the car as an investment\nand sell it after his tour of duty in Colombia ended, the\nofficial said.\nThe DEA did not obtain bank records from Aldridge\nshowing how the car was purchased. Instead, the agency's\nreview relied on the contract provided by Aldridge and\nrecords at Auto Mercantil Limitada, a luxury car\ndealership in Bogota that ordered the Mercedes from\nGermany.\nAuto Mercantile records showed that the car was ordered\nby Luis Rueda, a broker in Bogota. The down payment was\npaid in the form of two checks totaling $1,350.20 signed\nby Aldridge. The Auto Mercantil files do not reflect how\nthe balance of the car purchase was funded, the official\nsaid.\nThe DEA interviewed Rueda, who supported Aldridge's\naccount and said Taboada had nothing to do with the deal,\nthe official said.\nAldridge purchased the car at a time when\nnarco-terrorism was rampant in Colombia. By .order of the\nU.S. Embassy, DEA agents like Aldridge were driven to work\nby bodyguards.\nBoth of Aldridge's Colombian bodyguards, Marco\nUrrego-Moreno and Edgar Amaya-Pulido, told DEA that the\nMercedes remained in Aldridge's possession until he left\nthe country in 1988, long after the time Taboada said it\nhad gone to the cartel.\nAldridge was able to provide the DEA with a receipt\nshowing he paid 19,000 Colombian pesos for a car cover for\nthe Mercedes in 1988.\nThe DEA's review found that Aldridge sold the car in\n1988 for about $25,000 to two Colombians, Julio Tellez and\nHermann Neckam. They, in turn, sold the car to Fabio Cruz\nBernal, a Bogota car dealer.\nTaboada, a Colombian car importer as well as a\nconvicted drug dealer, said the cartel bought the car for\n$147,000. He said a two-year-old Mercedes station wagon\ncould not be purchased for as little as $25,000 in\nColombia because of an import ban on luxury cars.\nJose Clopatofsky, a Colombian car expert, said a price\nof $25,000 was so low for a Mercedes Benz in Colombia in\n1988 that it amounted to \"a gift.\"\nBut Tellez and Bernal supported Aldridge's story.\nNeckam could not be located and was not interviewed by\nDEA, the DEA official said. Taboada identified Neckam as\nhis go-between with Aldridge on the deal.\nAldridge did not supply bank records showing that\nTellez and Neckam bought the car in 1988. He reported a\n$10,500 profit from the car sale on his 1988 income tax\nreturn, the DEA official said. The two friends who appear\nin the contract with Aldridge told the DEA he repaid them\nand they made a profit on their loan. They also did not\nsupply bank records.\n\"What this case demonstrates is that we as an agency\nare very concerned about any allegations of wrongdoing on\nthe part of DEA employees,\" Phelps said.\nClinton blasts Colombia's efforts to fight drugs,\nbut refuses to impose sanctions By Christopher\nMarquis Knight-Ridder Newspapers\nWASHINGTON The Clinton administration on Wednesday\nsharply criticized Colombia's efforts to combat illegal\ndrug trafficking last year but refused to impose economic\nsanctions against the world's largest cocaine exporter.\n\"We clearly do not feel at this point that the\nColombian government is fully cooperating with us,\" said\nRobert Gelbard, the assistant secretary of state for\ninternational narcotics matters.\nThe administration, reviewing Colombia's performance\nfor 1994, is \"seriously concerned\" about Colombia's\nfailure to pursue drug kingpins, revamp lenient sentencing\nlaws, enact legislation against money-laundering and\nbattle corruption \"at all levels\" of Colombian society,\nGelbard said.\nStill, the government chose not to risk seriously\nstraining relations with the Colombia by \"de-certifying\"\nit under the terms of an eight-year-old annual evaluation\nprocess. That would have required the United States to\nhalt most aid to the country and oppose loans to Colombia\nfrom multilateral lenders.\nInstead, in its annual report to Congress on the\nperformance of drug-producing nations and countries\nthrough which drugs are shipped, the administration took\nthe lesser step of censuring Colombia's anti-narcotics\nefforts.\nClinton's finding was also an acknowledgment of\nfundamental disarray in the U.S. strategy to halt cocaine\nand heroin at its source. Despite sending hundreds of\nmillions in U.S. anti-narcotics aid to Colombia and\nseveral other South American nations since 1990, production\nis actually increasing and prosecutions of major\ntraffickers are scant.\n'' We want to continue to try to develop further our\nbilateral cooperation and try to achieve much better\nresults in Colombia on counter narcotics,\" he said, in\nexplaining the lighter punishment.\nHowever symbolic, the censure was a blow to the\ngovernment of Colombian President Ernesto Samper, which\nhad dispatched a flock of diplomats and law enforcement\nofficials to Washington in recent days to lobby for full\ncertification.\nThe Samper government released a statement Wednesday\n�saying it \"regrets\" the U.S. decision, insisting that\n\" i t does not acknowledge the magnitude of the effort our\ncountry has made in the struggle against drug trafficking,\nat a high cost in human life and economic resources.\"\nPrivately, Colombian officials said the move would not\naffect their current anti-drug efforts and suggested that\nit had more to do with domestic U.S. political concerns,\nnamely President Clinton's desire to demonstrate toughness\nagainst drugs before a Republican-controlled Congress.\nAs the source of virtually all of the refined cocaine\nreaching U.S. cities, Colombia is \"the most critical\ncountry in terms of the United States government and the\npresident's Western Hemisphere drug strategy,\" Gelbard\nsaid.\nMeanwhile, Bolivia and Peru, which account for 80\npercent of the raw material for cocaine, remained on the\nlist of countries receiving\na so-called \"national interest waiver\" the same\ntreatment given Colombia this year despite a performance\ndeemed unacceptable.\n\"More than five years after the Andean Initiative was\nannounced, the U.S. government has yet to reach effective\nagreements on anti-narcotics policy with its three key\nallies in the region,\" said George Vickers, executive\ndirector of the Washington Office on Latin America, .a\nchurch-funded policy watchdog.\nIn addition, Paraguay, a growing transit country for\ncocaine and marijuana, was added to the list for the first\ntime.\nOnly one nation in the hemisphere, Panama, improved its\nstanding in U.S. eyes, winning full certification largely\ndue to a policy of sweeping money-laundering controls\nimposed by the government of President Ernesto Perez\nBalladares.\nBy law, Congress has 30 days to overturn a presidential\ncertification, and it was unclear Wednesday whether the\nwaiver for Colombia would meet opposition among lawmakers.\nNorth Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, the Republican\nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said\nWednesday that Colombia's anti-drug performance has been\n\"demonstrably and woefully inadequate.\"\nHelms' committee staff released its own report on\nColombia this week urging decertification.\n(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)\nThe report was especially critical of Samper himself,\nciting \"credible allegations\" that he had received up to\n$6 million, in campaign contributions from the Cali cocaine\ncartel.\n\" I t is an understatement to say that I am concerned\nabout reports of widespread narco-corruption at all levels\nof the Colombian government,\" Helms said. \"... Colombia,\nin my judgment, has failed to meet even minimal standards\nfor certification.\"\nThe administration report made no mention of the\ncharges against Samper, allegedly documented on cassette\ntapes produced by the CIA and Colombian police. Samper\naides vigorously deny the charges and expressed confidence\nthis week that they had put the \" narco-cassette\" incident\nbehind them.\nGephardt to Propose Bill to. Erect Import\nBarriers By John Maggs, The Journal of\nCommerce Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News\nWASHINGTON-Mar. 2-House Minority Leader Richard\nGephardt, D-Mo., plans to introduce a new Japan trade bill\nin the next two weeks, according to House aides.\nWhile the Clinton administration and aides to the\nRepublican leadership do not give it much of a chance, the\nbill could be an early test of sentiment for major trade\nlegislation this year, and of the level of protectionism\nin the new GOP majority.\nIt also could be a referendum on Rep. Gephardt's\nability to use tough trade rhetoric to galvanize\nDemocrats, something that has not happened nearly as much\nunder President Clinton as under his two Republican\npredecessors.\nThe bill could be called the \" I f You Cant' Beat 'Em,\nJoin 'Em\" act of 1995. In a new twist for Rep. Gephardt,\nit would give President Clinton new powers to respond to\nJapan's restrictive business practices by establishing\nmirror restrictions in the United States.\nFor example, U.S. officials complain Japan excludes\nmany foreign auto parts through an unfairly discriminatory\ncertification procedure.\nUnder the Gephardt bill, the president could propose a\nsimilar licensing system for the United States, and get\nspecial expedited consideration for such a proposal in\nCongress.\nSince many of the retaliatory actions would erect\nsimilar bureaucratic hurdles for imports, it is not clear\nthat the bill would slip through the fervor in Washington\nto cut government.\n. The rather blunt approach echoes the complaints that\nRep. Gephardt has made for years about Japan and revives\nhis effort, put forward in string of hortatory bills, to\nexpress the inequity that many Democrats feel about trade\nrelations with Japan.\nThe bill may serve to increase the pressure on Japan in\nlong-running auto parts talks with the United States,\nwhich U.S. officials want to wrap up by March 31.\nNotwithstanding its slim chances, for approval in the\nRepublican Congress, the bill addresses a lingering question\nleft from the Uruguay Round on world trade that took effect\nJan. 1.\nWith most forms of U.S. trade retaliation restricted by\nnew international rules, what credible threat will the\nUnited States be able to use to force reforms by\nrecalcitrant countries?\nJapan's major trade barriers are beyond the scope of\nthese rules - enforced by the World Trade Organization but any retaliation against Japan's exports of\nmanufactured goods would be prohibited by the WTO.\nAction to erect similar barriers in the United States\nwould avoid this dilemma. END!A4?JC-GEPHARDT\nHouse Panel Approves Washington Airports Bill\nThe Journal of Commerce\nKnight-Ridder/Tribune Business News\nWASHINGTON-Mar. 2 - A House panel Wednesday\napproved a bill that will clean up constitutional questions\nabout Congress' oversight of two Washington-area airports.\nNational and Dulles International.\n\"Our aim with this bill is to correct the problems\nwith the current law, recently underlined by the Supreme\nCourt, in a way that continues to protect airport users\nand allows the airports to continue their vital .\nimprovement programs,\" Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman\nof the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,\nsaid in a prepared statement Wednesday.\nThe Supreme Court recently decided in favor of a group\nled by former District of Columbia Council Chairman John\nHechinger and a group called Citizens Against Aircraft\nNoise. They had argued that Congress' control of the\n�airport oversight board was an unconstitutional breach of\nthe separation of powers between the legislative and\nexecutive branches.\nThe bill approved Wednesday increases the number of\npresidential appointees to the airport authority's board\nof directors from one to five. The bill replaces the\nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board of\nReview, chaired by Rep. Norman Y. Mineta, D-Calif., with\nan advisory commission.\n\"To really understand the present situation, you have\nto take a step back into the past. In 1986, the two\nairports were leased by the federal government to a local\nauthority, the board of directors, for 50 years. This\ntransfer freed the airports from federal budget\nconstraints and permitted them to issue bonds in order to\nlaunch a major capital improvement program,\" Rep. Shuster\nsaid.\n\"The federal government built the airports, still owns\nthe airports and only about one-third of the passengers\nare local passengers. The fact is,\nthere is an overriding federal interest in these\nairports and that's why we have this bill,\" Rep. Shuster\nsaid.\nThe bill faces attempts by local interests to amend the\ndetails of the new advisory board and the ability of the\nairports to expand under federal authority when it goes to\nthe House 'floor, possibly as soon as next week.\nEND!A4?.IC-AIRPORTS-BILL\nU.S.-Russia Enterprise Investment Fund Starts\nSlowly By Milan Ruzicka, The Journal of\nCommerce Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News\nNEW YORK-Mar. 2-After more than 18 months in\nexistence, the $340 million Russian-American Enterprise\nFund got off the ground, committing $12 million in equity\ninvestment on five Russian enterprises but investing far\nmore on itself than on the companies it was designed to\nhelp.\nAccording to its own figures, so far, the fund has\nspent $3.5 million on administration and its staff\nsalaries and travel expenses. It invested $2.5 million and\nextended another $600,000 in loans.\nSteven Halliwell, the fund's chief financial officer,\nsaid, \"We're being very, very prudent in making\ninvestment decisions.\" But he added, \"The $64 question\nin these markets is what the value of your investments\nwill be.\"\nThe $340 million fund, set up in September 1993 and\nendowed by the U.S. government,, is in business extending\nfinancial assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises\nin Russia by either buying a share of their stock or\nextending loans.\nThe U.S. government has set up similar funds to help\nmost of the other Eastern bloc countries. All these funds\noperate on similar principles and are aimed at stimulating\nentrepreneurship in the former communist countries.\nThe largest of the five deals the Russian fund has\nstruck so far is\na commitment to invest $8 million in Dieselprom, an engine\nmanufacturing company in Cheboksary, the republic of\nChuvashia.\nThe fund's latest project is an investment of $600,000\nfor the purchase of 20 percent of Financial Center Grant,\na Moscow-based financial services company heavily involved\nin bidding for Russia's state-owned companies. The fund is\nalso involved in financing the acquisition of new\nmachinery for Marigrazhdanstroy, a recently privatized\nconstruction company. The fund's other projects include\ninvestment in a wood-processing company in Siberia and a\ngarment-manufacturing firm south of Moscow.\nThe fund, while not giving out grants, provides loans\nof up to $100,000, charging, according to Senior Managing\nDirector Roman Pipko, less than the 30 percent going\nshort-term rate in Moscow.\nBecause of the instability of the Russian currency, Mr.\nHalliwell said in a telephone interview, \"Ruble returns\nare very difficult to evaluate.\" He said that to hedge\nits bets, the fund is looking for export potential - and,\ntherefore, non-ruble earnings - as one of the key\nfactors in its investment decisions.\nThe fund employs 12 professionals and 15 support staff\nin its Moscow office and another six professionals in New\nYork. END!A4?.1C-RUSSIA-FUND\n�Social Security Is Focus of Debate Over Budget\nAmendment (Washn) By Saul Fiiedman= (c)\n1995, Newsday=\nWASHINGTON Depending on your point of view, the\nSocial Security system has become a stalking-horse or a piggy\nbank.\nBut either way, the future of the nation's retirement\nsystem has become the focus and the biggest sticking\npoint in the Senate battle over the balanced budget\namendment.\nThe reason: The Social Security trust fund, which was\nonce in danger of going into the red, will be rich in cash\nfor the next decade or so. Indeed, the Social Security\nAdministration estimates that the trust fund, which has\nbeen taking in much more than it pays out, will have a\nsurplus of more than $1 trillion in 2002.\nThat is the year for balancing the federal budget,\nunder provisions of the amendment. And among many\nDemocrats, Republican moderates and other advocates of\nSocial Security, there is concern that the fund will be a\ntempting target for politicians looking for money to meet\nthe amendment's requirement.\nThere is a deeper suspicion of Republican intentions\ntoward the retirement system. Conservative leaders of the\nRepublican congressional majority, especially in the\nHouse, have voiced opposition to any government-run\nretirement system. And conservative think tanks such as the\ninfluential Heritage Foundation are planning voluntary and\nprivate alternatives to Social Security.\nSenate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told\nreporters Wednesday that concern about Social Security had\nbecome the central issue in the balanced budget debate.\nDaschle, who met with senior citizens groups Wednesday,\nquestioned how Republicans could keep their promise to cut\ntaxes, increase military spending and balance the budget\nall without touching the Social Security fund.\nDaschle voted for the amendment last year when he was\npart of the Democratic majority. And he would do so again,\n\" i f I trusted them (the Republicans) as much as I trusted\nmy own majority.\"\nRepublicans angrily scoff at Democrats' fears and\ncharge they are merely using the Social Security issue as\nan. excuse and political cover to defeat the amendment,\nwhich 75 percent of voters support, according to most\npolls.\nBut the polls also report that voters oppose balancing\nthe budget by using Social Security funds. And House\nSpeaker Newt Gingrich told reporters Wednesday, \"We're\nprepared to guarantee Social Security's not going to be\ntouched, period.\"\nDemocrats reply that i f Republicans mean what they say,\nthey should agree to language in the amendment to exempt\nthe Social Security trust fund, which is financed by\npavroll taxes and is separate from the rest of the federal\nbudget.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who unsuccessfully\nsought such an exemption, said during the Senate debate\nTuesday that her proposal \"would place Social Security\noff-budget, thereby enshrining into the Constitution\ncongressional action and guaranteeing the integrity of the\nsystem.\"\nIn 1983, when the Social Security system was in danger\nof running out of money. Congress followed recommendations\nof a special commission appointed by the Reagan\nadministration. Lawmakers raised payroll taxes and made\nother adjustments so that the trust fund could deliberately\nbuild a surplus to pay for the massive number of\nretirements of baby boomers beginning in 2010.\nThat's the surplus that worries Democrats. Sens. Byron\nDorgan and Kent Conrad, the two North Dakota Democrats\nwho\nhelped block Senate passage of the amendment, said\nWednesday that they did so because without exempting\nSocial Security, future Congresses would be free to\n\"raid\" the fund to cut the federal deficit.\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, leader of the Republican\nforces for the amendment in the Senate, called Fcinstein's\namendment \"a sham\" and he insisted Republicans had no\nintention of raiding the Social Security system.\n(Optional add end)\nIntentions may collide with the reality of the numbers.\nRepublican plans to balance the budget with total cuts of\nat least $1.2 trillion in spending by 2002 will be\ndifficult and painful enough.\nBut that figure includes using the $1 trillion surplus\nin the Social Security trust fund, which means the cuts\nnecessary to reach\na balanced budget are closer to $2 trillion, which most\nexperts consider virtually impossible.\nThus, when the debate over the amendment began in the\nHouse more than a month ago. House Judiciary Committee\nChairman Henry Hyde, R-lll., acknowledged that \" i f you\nexclude the receipts of Social Security from computing the\nbudget, then cuts necessary in other programs would be\nDraconian.\"\nFeds Plan Crackdown on Food Stamp Fraud\n(Washn) By William Doiiglas= (c) 1995,\nNewsday=\nWASHINGTON Spurred in part by multimillion-dollar\nfraud cases, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wednesday\nproposed steps to crack down on trafficking in food\nstamps.\nThe department said it would ask Congress for\nlegislation that would permit tighter screening of grocery\nstores applying to participate in the $25 billion program,\nenhance fraud-fighting technology and stiffen the\npunishment for violators.\nThe food stamp program, which serves more than 27\nmillion people, has come under fire from Congress for\nlosing an estimated $1 billion annually to illegal\ntrafficking and $1.8 billion a year to fraud and mistakes\nby recipients and welfare caseworkers.\nHouse Republicans had planned to put food stamps under\nstate control as part of their \"Contract With America\"\nwelfare reform bill. But House Agriculture Committee\nChairman Pat Roberts, R-Kan., persuaded the Republican\nleadership to keep food stamps at the federal level to\nmaintain a \"safety net\" for the poor.\nAbout 77 percent of all food stamps are redeemed at\nauthorized supermarkets, but these represent only about 15\npercent of all authorized stores Most illegal activity\noccurs in small operations, some of which arc not real\nstores at all, said Roger Viadero, the Agriculture\nDepartment's inspector general.\nIn most cases, a recipient sells the food stamps for 50\ncents to 70 cents on the dollar, Viadero said, and the\nretailer is reimbursed the full value by the federal\ngovernment. Under the plan, which still needs sponsors in\nCongress, retailers will have to prove they are legitimate\ngrocery markets before getting authorization to handle\nfood stamps. Stores may receive short-term authorizations\nto join the program while USDA officials scrutinize their\nrecords.\n\"They may have to wait six months while wc check them\nout,\" Viadero said.\nThe department wants the authority to suspend alleged\nviolators more quickly when business or tax records\n�indicate fraud, Acting Agriculture Secretary Richard\nRomingcr said. Agriculture officials are also seeking the\npower to seize assets acquired through trafficking of food\nstamps.\nThe Agriculture Department's crackdown is, in part,\nmotivated by high-profile New York City fraud cases that\nhave cost the government tens of millions of dollars.\nA two-year investigation that ended last September\nrevealed that 70 \"owners\" of non-existent stores\nlaundered $40 million in food stamps. Investigators said\nmany of the fake stores were closed during business hours,\nhad little or no food and even fewer customers.\nTwenty-nine people were arrested and warrants were issued\nfor 40 others.\nDole Calls for 'New Realism' in U.S.-Russian\nRelations (Washn) By Martin Kasindorf= (c)\n1995, Newsday=\nWASHINGTON Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,\nsuggesting at a foreign affairs conference Wednesday that an\nauthoritarian Boris N. Yeltsin had outlived his political\nusefulness, charged President Clinion with excessive\ncoziness toward Moscow's leader.\nBut Dole agreed with Clinton who spoke to the same\nforum Wednesday night that the United States should\nmaintain world leadership despite growing isolationist\nsentiment.\nDole, a Kansas Republican who plans to declare his\npresidential candidacy April 10, called for a \"new\nrealism\" in U.S.-Russian relations that \"does not paper\nover important policy differences with an appeal to\npersonal ties.\" Dole asserted that Clinton, following a\n\"Russia-first policy, which has turned into a\nYeltsin-first policy,\" had neglected to \"state American\nconcerns forcefully before thousands were slaughtered in\nChechnya.\"\nDole said it is wrong to \"ignore the fact that\nPresident Yeltsin has made serious errors, and has moved\ntoward authoritarian rule, and has lost the political\nsupport of virtually all reform-minded Russians.\"\nIn a more \"honest relationship,\" Dole said, the\nUnited States would emphasize \"the significance of\nRussia's 1996 elections and the pivotal importance of a\npeaceful democratic transition of power.\" Yeltsin is\nexpected to seek re-election.\nDole also asserted that Clinton is showing \"timidity\"\nby sending U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright to world\ncapitals to lobby for continuing U.N. Security Council\nsanctions against Iraq, rather than announcing that the\nUnited States would veto any attempt to lift the\nsanctions.\nClinton made no direct response to Dole's criticism in\nthe prepared text of his address to the conference,\nsponsored by the Richard Nixon Center for Peace and\nFreedom.\nThe president focused roughly half of his speech on the\nU.S. campaign to persuade an 86-nation majority of the\nsigners of the 25-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty to renew it indefinitely at a meeting in New York\nin April.\nIn a display of U.S. nuclear disarmament efforts to\nwavering Third World nations, Clinton announced the\nremoval of 200 tons of enriched uranium and plutonium\nenough for \"thousands of weapons,\" an administration\nofficial said from U.S. military stockpiles.\nClinton argued forcefully for U.S. engagement in world\nproblems, indirectly attacking Republican-sponsored House\nlegislation that would curtail U.S. support for U.N.\npeacekeeping missions and U.S. troops' involvement in such\noperations.\n\"The new isolationists are wrong,\" Clinton said.\n\"They would have us face the future alone. We must not\nlet the ripple of isolationism they have generated build\ninto a tidal wave. I f we withdraw from the world today, we\nwill have to contend with the consequences of our neglect\ntomorrow.\"\nDole, too, recognized and rejected a widespread\n\"eagepess to unload the burden\" of involvement.\n\"Richard Nixon was right,\" Dole said. \"Leadership does\nnot come without a price tag, but, in my view, it's a price\nworth paying.\"\n(Optional add end)\nNational security adviser Anthony Lake, telling\nreporters that \"we welcome the thrust of the senator's\nspeech, much of which We could have given ourselves,\"\ntook issue with Dole over the administration's dealings\nwith Russia and Iraq.\nLake noted that Clinton has spoken out against Russian\nmilitary excesses in Chechnya. Acknowledging-that the war\nhas alienated Yeltsin from reformist allies, Lake said the\nUnited States should act to make their reconciliation\n\"easier,\" while \"making known our disagreements arid\nconcerns.\"\nDole is \"misinformed\" about Albright, who is carrying\na \"very tough message\" on Iraq and has declared that\nClinton is prepared to use a veto to keep sanctions, Lake\nsaid.\n\"We do not need lectures on how to stand up against\nthe Iraqis,\" Lake said, citing Clinton's cruise-missile\nretaliation for an alleged Iraqi assassination plot\nagainst former President Bush and the dispatch of U.S.\nforces when Saddam Hussein appeared ready to reinvade\nKuwait.\n�Dole says Senate to vote on balanced budget\namendment Thursday By Robert Dodge Dallas\nMorning News\nWASHINGTON As the battle over the balanced budget\namendment took an acrimonious turn, Senate Majority Leader\nBob Dole said Wednesday he would allow senators a final\nvote on the proposal Thursday.\nThe Kansas Republican said there had been no progress\nin resolving differences with pivotal Democrats, and the\nGOP was still one short of the 67 votes needed for\napproval.\nIf the amendment fails, Dole said, he will bring it up\nagain shortly before the 1996 presidential election.\n\"We are still hopeful, we are still receptive, but\nwe've gone as far as we can go,\" said Dole, noting that\nsix Democrats who voted for\na balanced budget amendment last year were opposing this\nyear's proposal.\n\" I t is an interesting nip-Hop that they cannot\nexplain, and the American people do not understand,\" he\nsaid.\nDole made his announcement after House Speaker Newt\nGingrich of Georgia drew the wrath of Senate Democrats by\naccusing several of lying to constituents by promising to\nend deficit spending and then opposing the balanced budget\namendment. He singled out Minority Leader Tom Daschle,\nD-S.D., and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.\nDemocrats called Gingrich's behavior unseemly and\naccused Republicans of trying to loot the Social Security\ntrust fund to balance the budget.\nThe discord festered early .in the day after Dole\nrefused to allow a vote on the balanced budget amendment\nand recessed the Senate for a second lime in two days.\nWith pivotal Democrats refusing to support the amendment,\nGOP leaders could not come up with the two-thirds majority\nneeded to approve a constitutional amendment.\nBut at the end of the day, Dole said he would allow the\nSenate to vote Thursday. The amendment would require\nCongress and the president lo balance the budget by 2002.\n\" I t never occurred to me you (would) have two senators\nwho lied with their states to get re-elected,\" Gingrich\nsaid when asked about the Senate's failure to vote.\n\"She went back home, she campaigned in a very close\nrace, she said 'I'm for a balanced budget,'\" Gingrich\nsaid of Feinstein. \"She said ' ] really am a fiscal\nconservative; we really need the balanced budget.' She's\nnow found the skinniest and most spurious of excuses to\nhide.\"\nAsked whether there was a second liar, Gingrich\nimmediately pointed to Daschle. And he referred to others\nwithout mentioning names, who voted for a balanced budget\namendment in the past when there was no chance of approval\nbut now had withdrawn their support.\n\"Apparently there are several liberal Democrats who\nwere for a balanced budget amendment as long as it wasn't\ngoing to pass,\" he added. \" I mean, how else can you\nexplain some of these votes?\"\nSen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., general chairman of the\nDemocratic National Committee, said Gingrich's remarks had\ndone a \"great disservice to the office he holds.\n\" I think this is unseemly,\" Dodd added. \" I think it\nbrings dishonor to him as an individual and dishonor on\nthe office of the speaker. Serious senators are giving\nserious consideration to one of the most serious votes\nthey will ever cast.\"\nDaschle said, \" I n South Dakota, we can disagree\nwithout being disagreeable. Frankly, I am disappointed. I\nwould have expected more from Newt Gingrich than that.\"\nFeinstein said she voted for the balanced budget\namendment last year and made note of that during her 1994\ncampaign. But she said it became clear this year that\n�Republican leaders want to use Social Security payroll\ntaxes to cut the deficit.\n\" I wasn't elected by Newt Gingrich, but by\nCalifornians,\" Feinstein said. \"1 do not consider that 1\nhave lied to my constituents, because I voted for a\nbalanced budget amendment.\n(EDITORS: STORY CAN TRIM HERE)\n\"I've been a mayor for nine years,\" the former San\nFrancisco leader added. \" I have been Mau-Maued by the\nvery best in the business ... and it does not move me.\"\nCurrently, the Social Security trust fund has a\nsurplus.\nThe government's accounting methods include the surplus\nin calculating the deficit, which makes Washington's red\nink look smaller. Without this year's $70 billion Social\nSecurity surplus, the deficit would be $260 billion.\nDemocratic senators have said they want to make sure\nthe surplus is not used to reduce the deficit or mask the\nsize of the shortfall.\nBut Republicans said the best way to protect Social\nSecurity was to stop the government's deficit spending. The Treasury already borrows from the Social Security\nsurplus and issues bonds to the trust fund.\nFuiure tax revenues will be required to retire those\nbonds.\nWithout the surplus, the Republican majority on Capitol\nHill would have to find even more unpopular spending cuts\nto balance the budget. And they have been under pressure\nfrom Democrats to show how they plan to meet the 2002\ngoal.\n\"They have refused to listen to the people of this\ncountry who have a right to know how they will balance the\nbudget, and most importantly, they have refused to join us\nas wc insist on real protections for Social Security,\"\nDaschle said.\nIn a final effort to underscore their argument,\nDemocrats sent to Republicans an alternative amendment\nthat would protect Social Security.\n\"We can get more than 70 votes for a balanced budget\namendment with this proposal, and now it's up to\nRepublicans to prove that they won't raid Social Security\nby simply putting it down in black and white,\" said Sen.\nErnest Hollings, D-S.C.\nRepublicans offered Democrats several alternatives\nTuesday to protect Social Security in separate\nlegislation. The various proposals failed to satisfy\nDemocrats who said lawmakers could easily repeal the\nlegislation if it was not part of the constitutional\namendment.\nIf the balanced budget amendment fails, it would be a\nmajor setback for Republicans.\n' The proposal is a key element the House Republican\n\"Contract With America.\" And it would be an\nembarrassment for Dole, who is seeking the 1996 GOP\npresidential nomination.\nRepublicans portrayed Thursday's vote as among the most\nimportant lawmakers will face. They said it was an\nopportunity to protect the financial of future\ngenerations.\n\"We will determine once and for all who is for and who\nis against\na balanced budget amendment,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch,\nR-Utah.\nClinton acknowledges failure in Colombia, but\ndoesn't urge sanctions By David L. Marcus\nDallas Morning News\nWASHINGTON President Clinton formally criticized the\nanti-drug efforts of four South American countries\nWednesday in an admission that America's overseas fight\nagainst narcotics trafficking is failing.\nWhile acknowledging setbacks in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia\nand Paraguay, Clinton asked Congress not to impose\neconomic sanctions against the countries.\nClinton's announcement, made by the White House and the\nState Department, concluded a debate over the\n\"certification\" process that has raged for weeks.\n\"This tough approach makes it clear again this year\nthat counternarcotics is crucial to U.S. foreign policy\nand our bilateral relations,\" said drug czar Lee Brown.\nEvery year the administration evaluates the efforts of\n27 countries that produce and ship illegal drugs. After\nbeing measured against standards in U.S. laws and a U.N.\ninternational drug accord, they can be certified or\ndecertified. Or they can be given conditional approval\nbecause they represent a \"vital national security\ninterest\" as in the case of the four South American\ncountries and Lebanon and Pakistan.\nClinton urged the harshest action against Iran,\nNigeria, Syria, Afghanistan and Burma. They will be denied\nU.S. aid, and American representatives to the World Bank\nand other agencies must vote against their requests for\nloans.\nA lengthy State Department report on the international\nnarcotics situation described Colombia as having a\n\"lackluster\" counternarcotics performance in 1994.\n\"Weak legislation, corruption and inefficiency\nhampered efforts to bring mid- and high-level narcotics\ntraffickers to justice,\" the report said. \"No\ndrug-related assets were forfeited, while already lenient\nsentences were further reduced pursuant to automatic\nsentencing reductions.\"\nArguing that cocaine production is soaring and\n\"narco-corruption\" is spreading, a few influential\nofficials said they urged the White House to take harsher\nactions against several Latin American countries. Those\npresent at the discussions said the most controversial\ndecision involved Colombia, the world's leading producer\nand distributor of cocaine and the fastest-growing\nproducer of heroin.\nWednesday's action marked the first time that Colombia\nonce considered Washington's best ally in the drug fight\nwas not fully certified for its actions.\nColombian officials in recent weeks have said the\nUnited States is hypocritical because it complains about\nthe supply of drugs from overseas, but has had little\nsuccess in curbing demand at home.\nBogota already turned its attention to the U.S.\nCongress, which has\na month to approve or change Clinton's recommendations.\nColombia has hired two lobbyists with Republican\nconnections, and a source said it is screening another\nlobbying firm.\nColombian officials said they are most worried about\ntwo members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\nSen. Jesse Helms, the chairman, and Sen. John Kerry, who\nhas held hearings on drugs and terrorism.\nBoth denounced President Ernesto Samper last summer\nafter secretly recorded conversations of Cali drug bosses\nwere made public. The bosses spoke about donating $3.8\nmillion to the Samper campaign in the closing days of a\ntight race.\nSamper denied receiving \"hot money\" and opened his\nbooks to reporters. A prosecutqr cleared the campaign of\nany wrongdoing.

NASA intends to eliminate 20\npercent of the jobs involved in the agency's space shuttle\nprogram, top officials said Wednesday.\nA new internal work-force study has concluded that\n5,900 jobs \"could be done away with\" starting this\nspring because of redundancies in existing shuttle\noperations, said Wayne Littles, NASA's associate\nadministrator for spaceflight.\nA total of 30,000 people work on the shuttle program\nthroughout the country. Littles said. About 3,300 of them\nare NASA civil servants, the rest are employed by private\ncontractors.\nLittles and Kennedy Space Center Director .lay Honeycutt\nsaid it is too early to tell how many jobs would be\neliminated at KSC, where the shuttle work force now\nconsists of about 16,000 private employees and civil\nservants.\nAll Honeycutt would say is that KSC's share would\namount to less than half the overall job loss.\nThe work-force review, conducted by shuttle director\nand former astronaut Bryan O'Connor, made 560\nrecommendations, though Littles said a written report of\nthe recommendations was not available.\nBecause other efficiency and reorganization studies are\nstill under way, most of O'Connor's recommendations won't\nbe acted on for at least two months, to sec how they fit\nin with other plans, Littles said.\nAs a result, the 5,900 job cuts are \"not a done\ndeal,\" he added.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration is\ntrying'to trim\na total of $5 billion over the next five years from its $14\nbillion-a-year budget. Eliminating the 5,900 jobs would\nsave the agency about $200 million a year, Littles said.\nOne of the prime reasons NASA believes it can eliminate\nmore jobs is that too many people are checking each\nother's work in some cases, Littles said.\nFor instance, he said, shuttle-processing work done at\nKSC by a Lockheed technician is first checked by a\nLockheed inspector, then by\na government inspector and then by other departments and\norganizations before the shuttle actually flies.\n\"There are places in our requirements where we ask 14\nother organizations to check and make sure that work which\nwas done which has already been checked once or twice to\nmake sure it's OK,\" Littles said. \"The question the team\nasks is: Do you really need to do that?\"\nThe Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, a watchdog group\ncreated by Congress, will probably look into the proposed\ncuts \"to make sure they are not conducive to damaging\nsafety,\" said Seymour Himmel, a member of the panel.\n\"When you start cutting the actual people who lay\nhands on hardware, then you better take a good, hard\nlook,\" said Himmel, a retired NASA executive.\n\"Presumably, that's what Bryan O'Connor's group has\ndone.\"\nHimmel said he hasn't seen O'Connor's recommendations\nso he could not comment on them specifically. He said the\nproposal to cut 5,900 jobs \"does sound like a lot.\"\nBut he noted that, once a program like the shuttle has\nbeen around\na while, much of the design and engineering work needed in\nthe early stages is no longer necessary. Furthermore, he\nsaid, NASA's recent decision to fly only seven shuttles a\nyear instead of eight would allow for fewer workers.\nThere is plenty to cut in NASA's shuttle program,\naccording to John Logsdon, space policy director at George\nWashington University.\n(EDITORS: NEXT 2 GRAFS OPTIONAL TRIM)\nLogsdon said a friend in the shuttle program sent him a\nChristmas card in which the friend reported that his\noffice is one-third overstaffed.\n\"There is a lot of excess capacity we would not call\nit fat in the shuttle system,\" Logsdon said. \" I t may\nnot be KSC, it may be more Johnson than Kennedy.\"\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM)\nThe shuttle program is managed out of Johnson Space\nCenter in Houston, though a separate NASA study is\nrecommending that control of the program be shifted to the\nshuttles' launch site in Central Florida to save money and\njobs.\n\"It's painful for the individual involved, but it's a\nnecessary part of the overall restructuring of the civil\nspace program,\" Logsdon said.\nSome of the redundancies now in the program were\ninstituted after the shuttle Challenger accidentally\nexploded in January 1986, killing seven astronauts. But\nLogsdon, like Littles, said he doesn't believe the cuts\nwould harm shuttle safety.\n(EDITORS: STORY C A N TRIM HERE)\n\"Who has the most to lose i f the cuts made the shuttle\nless safe?\nI would argue it's (NASA Administrator) Dan Goldin,\" the\ndriving force behind the current budget cutting, Logsdon\nsaid.\nNASA contractors have complained in the past that the\nspace agency is sparing government employees at the,\nexpense of outside Workers.\nLittles acknowledged that, while civil service workers\nnow make up 11 percent of the shuttle work force, they\nwould absorb less than 10 percent of the job cuts.\nDuring the past three years, contractors' share of the\nshuttle work force has shrunk 22 percent, while the number\nof civil service employees has been cut 15 percent.\nThat may change, Littles said.\n\"One of the things we're going to look at very hard is\nwhether we need to fundamentally change the role of the\ngovernment work force in this program, in areas where it\nis mature and where we're actually doing things\nroutinely,\" he said. \"We're going to look to see i f we\ncan back o f f some of the civil service work force we have\nthere.\"\nLockheed Space Operations Co., the biggest contractor\nat KSC, \" w i l l be responsive to the directions wc will\nreceive from NASA,\" spokesman Bob Granath said. \"We will\ndo everything we can to keep the manifest that NASA wants\n,to fly while maintaining safety and quality.\"\n�\nDublin Core\nThe Dublin Core metadata element set is common to all Omeka records, including items, files, and collections.

Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, launched a new law firm with Brian Newby, Republican Gov. Rick Perry’s former chief of staff. Now, with Davis in a hotly contested bid for re-election, her legal practice — and, in particular, her closely held list of government and quasi-public clients — is drawing heat from her Republican opponent, state Rep. Mark Shelton of Fort Worth.\nDavis held a hastily called press conference on Friday morning to denounce the content of attack ads she said were being produced by Shelton’s campaign. The scripts for three ads — none of which had been broadcast — were leaked to Davis’ campaign via “a third party,” she said.\n“The claims made and the themes depicted are false,” Davis said. “Rather than talking about issues that matter to families living in Tarrant County, Mark Shelton is using actors and actresses to say things that aren’t true.”\nShelton’s campaign did not dispute the authenticity of the ad scripts. One of the ads cites Davis’ legal work, painting her as a corrupt lawmaker using her Senate post to gain lucrative contracts.\n“It is not right for Davis to vote to raise taxes and then steer herself lucrative public contracts,” Shelton said in a statement on Friday. “This abusive self-enrichment is nothing short of Davis being a greedy public office who is robbing taxpayers’ pockets to line her own pockets.”\nThe Texas Constitution prohibits lawmakers from voting on bills they have a “personal or private interest” in. State law also bars them from voting on measures that will directly benefit a specific business transaction if they have a controlling interest.\nSince its inception, the Newby Davis law firm has drawn scrutiny over whether its work creates conflict of interest issues for Davis, who has said the practice offers legal services for cities and other public entities as well as companies trying to do business with those entities. The firm works out of offices owned by Cantey Hanger, one of Fort Worth’s largest and oldest law firms. Newby and Davis also do legal work for Cantey Hanger individually. But their Newby Davis firm is certified as a minority-owned business, allowing it to help public entities and private firms fulfill legal requirements or best-practice recommendations that they hire such contractors.\nThe line between Davis’ public and private work raised eyebrows right from the start of her new legal career. In 2010, when Cantey Hanger announced in a press release that it was hiring Davis, it listed Davis’ taxpayer-funded communications director Anthony Spangler and her district office phone number as the press contact.\nWhile Davis has long insisted that her work as a lawyer does not conflict with her work as a state senator — she has said she retains a legal ethics adviser to help ensure that she is keeping clear of any potential conflicts — she has declined requests to identify her public sector clients, citing attorney-client privilege.\n“It’s an attorney-client privilege issue and unless and until my clients say to me, ‘You are free to disclose that,’ I really don’t think that I can,” Davis told a Fort Worth Star-Telegram reporter earlier this year.\nPublic records show Davis’ public sector clients run the gamut in North Texas, from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to the Fort Worth Independent School District.\nOne such client, the North Texas Tollway Authority, disclosed last year that the FBI was investigating possible conflicts of interest involving tollway authority officials, though there’s been no indication that the investigation relates to Davis.\nLast year, the Star-Telegram reported several potential conflict-of-interest issues related to NTTA board members, including one involving Board Chairman Kenneth Barr, a former Fort Worth mayor.\nAt an NTTA board meeting in 2011, Barr made a motion that Newby Davis be hired to handle condemnation issues related to the Chisholm Trail Parkway. At the time, Barr failed to disclose that he had a business relationship with Cantey Hanger, the firm where Newby and Davis also work, and which partners with the Newby Davis law firm on legal business. Barr keeps an office in Cantey Hanger’s building in downtown Fort Worth. Also in 2009, Barr, Newby and Cantey Hanger attorney David Chappell briefly formed a partnership named Barr Newby Chappell Consulting, according to state records.\nThe tollway board voted unanimously to hire Newby Davis. Barr has said his failure to inform fellow board members of the past relationship or to consider abstaining from the vote was an oversight, but NTTA spokesman Michael Rey said the agency has no reason to believe Davis has not complied with her ethical requirements as a lawyer and as a legislator.\n“The NTTA has no issue with the quality of the legal work Sen. Davis has performed on its behalf thus far,” Rey said. “These legal matters have been limited to routine property acquisition work for the Chisholm Trail project.”\nVictor Vandergriff, an NTTA board member, said he didn’t believe there was anything unethical in the way the board hired Newby Davis, but that the situation was handled too quickly and in a way that aroused suspicion.\n“The optics of that could have looked better,” Vandergriff said.\nThough Davis’ legal contract with NTTA was approved during the last legislative session, Davis’ campaign said the senator did not start her work until after the session ended. As proof of her independence, she pointed to a bill she filed in the last session that would have lowered the fees the NTTA was allowed to collect from toll scofflaws.\nShelton’s campaign, meanwhile, has accused Davis of switching her vote on a toll road bill after receiving a lucrative legal services contract with the NTTA. Davis voted against a bill in 2009 regarding how entities like the NTTA can bid on toll projects. She voted for a similar bill in 2011. Davis campaign spokesman Zac Evans said Davis’ vote changed because the bills did.\n“The 2009 bill gave NTTA exclusive rights to any toll project in the area… even if they were incapable of completing it in a timely manner,” Evans said. “The 2011 bill had provisions that would deprive NTTA of that exclusive right to develop a project.”\nIn addition to its work for the NTTA, Newby Davis has served as minority bond counsel for both DFW Airport and the Tarrant County Water District. A bond counsel’s work includes advising a city or other public entity issuing a municipal bond and insuring that the bond meets all legal requirements. Newby Davis has worked on more than $1 billion in bonds issued by the airport and at least $150 million in bonds for the Water District.\nAlong with her work with Newby Davis, the senator has also provided legal services to some public entities via her role as “of counsel” with Cantey Hanger. She has performed legal work for Fort Worth ISD on employment law matters, according to the district. She has also provided legal services for the Benbrook Water Authority for more than a year, according to David Wasson, the water authority’s general manager.\nDuring the last legislative session, Davis was the senate sponsor of a bill that gave the Benbrook Water Authority the power to pay for private property damage that stemmed from a backup of the authority’s sewer system even when it wasn’t held liable for the damages (Shelton was the bill’s House sponsor). No other public entity was directly impacted by the bill, which Perry signed into law in June.\nWasson said there was no connection between Davis’ sponsorship of the bill and her work for the water authority. He said he reached out to Austin firm Lloyd Gosselink to work on the bill, and that the firm asked Shelton and Davis to sign on.\nDavis has forcefully disputed any suggestion that her votes were compromised.\n“The legislation I have championed, including the bills I authored or co-authored regarding NTTA and the Benbrook Water Authority, is centered entirely around my commitment to protect Texans from fiscally harmful decisions and to hold governmental agencies appropriately accountable to the people they serve,” Davis told a Star-Telegram reporter in March.\nIn addition to Shelton’s accusations of legal conflicts, one of the ad scripts Davis released has Shelton accusing her of breaking state ethics laws due to the work of her “business partner” — Newby — as a “special interest lobbyist.” The ad also says Davis owns a lobbying firm.\nIn both 2011 and 2012, Newby registered as a lobbyist with the Texas Ethics Commission and cited “Newby Davis” as one of his clients. Evans said Newby registered with the commission “out of an over-abundance of caution.”\n“Mr. Newby has never received compensation for lobbying on behalf of Newby Davis, nor has he testified before or lobbied anyone in the Legislature,” Evans said.\nTexas Tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories, or may be the subject of them.

The action in Texas now moves to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which will review the ruling in the coming months. For now, however, a substantial part of the Texas law has been ruled unconstitutional and is on hold, pending the outcome of the appeal.\nPassage of the new Texas law is part of a larger drive, mostly in states in the South and Midwest, to more strictly limit and regulate abortion. For example, in recent years, 12 states outside of Texas, including North Dakota and Arizona, have enacted laws banning abortion at 20 weeks or sooner.\nAnother 11 states, including Wisconsin and Alabama, have enacted statutes requiring doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges. But many of these new regulations have been challenged in court and subject to injunctions. For instance, in Wisconsin and Alabama, like Texas, the new admitting requirements have yet to be enforced due to court-ordered injunctions that are in place pending appeals.\nThe legislative and legal battle in Texas attracted particular attention because it followed a much-publicized 11-hour filibuster by Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis that initially stymied passage of the measure. Davis now plans to run for governor.\nThe statute, which was enacted in July, would require doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and require clinics to meet health standards consistent with surgical operating centers. These provisions were struck down by the judge, who ruled that they would force many of the state’s clinics to shut down and therefore would unreasonably restrict women’s access to abortions.\nThe court did uphold another provision of the law, requiring abortion doctors to follow certain federal protocols when administering abortion-inducing drugs. This provision, as well as a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy (which was not challenged), will take effect as scheduled today.\nResidents of Texas and the seven other South Central states are the most opposed to abortion in the country, with 52% saying that the practice should be illegal in all or most cases, according to aggregated data taken from Pew Research Center polls in 2012 and 2013. By contrast, in the six New England states, only 20% say that abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Overall, a majority of Americans favor abortion rights, with 54% saying it should be legal in all or most cases and 40% stating that it should be illegal in all or most cases.\nAbortion-rights supporters contend that the new clinic requirements enacted in Texas and elsewhere are a thinly veiled attempt to limit and ultimately outlaw abortion under the guise of protecting women’s health. But abortion opponents say there is a need for tighter regulation and point to revelations about Philadelphia abortion-provider Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted earlier this year of three counts of murder as well as 21 counts of illegally conducting abortions past Pennsylvania’s 24-week limit.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nFormer Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis, best known for her 13-hour filibuster of a 2013 abortion bill, has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Texas’ recent abortion law. The suit claims the law is “blatantly unconstitutional” and written to “make a mockery of the federal courts.”\nThe law, which went into effect in September and empowers private citizens to bring civil lawsuits against anyone who “aids or abets” in an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, has led abortion clinics to stop providing the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy.\nMeanwhile, abortion funds — nonprofit advocacy groups that help pay for abortions and related expenses — have seen increased demand from pregnant Texans seeking care outside the state. This financial support has put these funds in the crosshairs of abortion opponents, who have claimed on social media and in legal filings that abortion fund donors, employees and volunteers are susceptible to lawsuits and criminal charges.\nDavis, who was the Democratic nominee for Texas governor in 2014 and unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2020, donates to and works with the Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equity, an Austin-based abortion fund, according to the lawsuit. She claims in the suit that these threats against donors and volunteers “have had a chilling effect” and stop her from associating with “like-minded people to express her views and achieve her advocacy goals.”\nShe is joined in the suit by the Stigma Relief Fund, an abortion fund associated with abortion provider Whole Woman’s Health, and Marva Sadler and Sean Mehl, who both work for Whole Woman’s Health and serve on the board of the Stigma Relief Fund. Sadler and Mehl say in the suit that they have stopped donating to abortion funds “until the Court clarifies whether and to what extent [they] can face liability for doing so.”\nThey are suing state Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, and three private citizens who have made efforts to bring lawsuits against abortion funds. Cain recently sent cease-and-desist letters to all the Texas abortion funds, accusing them of criminal conduct.\nIn a written response late Tuesday, Cain reiterated statements made in his cease-and-desist letter and repeated his intention to pass legislation next year that would allow district attorneys to prosecute abortion-related crimes outside their home jurisdictions.\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday claims that the law violates the plaintiff’s rights to due process and free speech and asks the court to declare both this law and Texas’ older abortion law unenforceable.\n“We are asking the courts today to stop the unconstitutional harassment of abortion funds by confirming S.B.8 cannot be used to silence donors with bogus threats,” Davis said in a statement. “More than that, we are asking the courts to stop the nightmare S.B.8 has created for Texans if they need abortion services.”\nLegal background\nIn recent months, abortion opponents have accused abortion funds of both civil and criminal impropriety, and the abortion funds have brought their own legal challenges to block the law.\nThe chief architects of Texas’ new abortion law have asked a state district judge to allow them to depose the leaders of two abortion funds, seeking to “better evaluate the prospects for legal success” in potential lawsuits over illegal abortions.\nAnti-abortion advocacy groups including the Thomas More Society have also tweeted at different abortion funds, claiming their donors could face lawsuits. The law specifies that paying for a prohibited abortion constitutes “aiding and abetting,” and someone can be sued “regardless of whether the person knew or should have known that the abortion would be performed or induced in violation” of the law.\nLast month, two abortion funds filed federal lawsuits against the anti-abortion advocacy groups that had threatened to bring lawsuits against them.\nRecently, Cain claimed that the abortion funds could also face criminal charges under a Texas abortion statute that was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973. Cain claimed in his cease-and-desist letter that the law, which was never repealed by lawmakers, was recently reaffirmed when the state passed the new abortion law.\nDavis’ lawsuit asks the judge to affirm that the old criminal statute is unenforceable and that the newer law is unconstitutional.\nThe current law “seeks not only to strip Texans of their fundamental right to make decisions about their pregnancies based on their individual circumstances and religious beliefs, but also to make a mockery of the federal courts,” the lawsuit said.\nIn December, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out most of the arguments brought by abortion providers to challenge the law, and though a state judge found the law to be unconstitutional, he allowed it to remain in effect.\nWe can’t wait to welcome you in person and online to the 2022 Texas Tribune Festival, our multiday celebration of big, bold ideas about politics, public policy and the day’s news — all taking place just steps away from the Texas Capitol from Sept. 22-24.

By Tuesday, Trump warned Putin was \"playing with fire.\"\nThe comments are the clearest sign yet of Trump's mounting frustration with Putin -- but the question remains whether he will take any punitive action against Russia or if he's making idle threats.\nAsked on Wednesday what the consequences would be if Russia continues its intensified barrage on Ukraine, Trump deflected.\n\"Well, I'm not going to tell you exactly. But the words speak pretty loud,\" he said.\nTrump was asked on Sunday if he would consider imposing new sanctions on Russia. The president said \"absolutely.\"\nThe Kremlin responded that Trump's criticism of Putin was an \"emotional reaction\" and that he didn't \"fully understand\" their military motives.\n\"Putin's intent has been obvious. He's stated it over and over. He's acted on it. It is to be sure that Ukraine is not a sovereign nation,\" said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine currently serving as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \"He is not a friend of the United States. And this has been clear for a long time. He has been able to play and outplay President Trump all along.\"\n\"I think that President Trump is recognizing that reality,\" Taylor told ABC News. \"That Putin is not his buddy. That Putin is attacking Ukraine in record numbers of missiles and drones right after speaking to Trump. This is not a serious negotiator. Putin is very clearly not interested in stopping this war.\"\nTrump continued to say on Wednesday he was \"disappointed\" and \"not happy\" with Russia's onslaught toward Ukraine.\n\"Trump’s comments won’t necessarily affect the stance either side takes in these talks: the Ukrainians will convey maximum flexibility, while the Russians will stress the concessions they expect Kyiv to make. Where you could see a change is in the U.S. attitude toward new sanctions or new aid to Ukraine,\" said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who served as the State Department's ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union.\nTrump had promised to end the war on Day 1 in office -- a pledge he later said was hyperbolic.\nHe's come under heavy scrutiny for making public demands of Ukraine, including that it give up the goal of NATO membership and possibly conceding some territory gained by Putin's forces, while not doing the same with Russia.\nAn hourslong phone call between Trump and Putin last week yielded no major breakthroughs. Putin said he was ready to work on a \"memorandum on a possible future peace agreement\" but showed no signs of making concessions.\nTrump had said after that call direct talks between Ukraine and Russia would start immediately and possibly be held at the Vatican. Russia later rejected the Vatican as a location.\nRetired Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's Special Presidential Envoy for Ukraine, told Fox News this week that new Russia-Ukraine talks could take place in Geneva -- perhaps involving Trump, Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On the \"memorandum\" mentioned by Putin, Kellogg said Ukraine has given their version of the document and \"now we need to get the same from Russia.\"\nTrump on Wednesday said he would sit down with Putin and Zelenskyy \"if it's necessary.\" Asked if he still believed Putin really wants to end the war, Trump sidestepped.\n\"I can't tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But I'll let you know in about two weeks. Within two weeks. We're going to find out very soon. We're going to find out whether or not he's tapping us along or not. And if he is, we’ll respond a little bit differently. But it will take about a week and a half, two weeks.\"\nTrump made similar comments back in April wondering if Putin was \"tapping\" the U.S. along, and warned they'd take another tack if so, though nothing has substantially changed since then.\n\"Trying to read Putin’s mind is a risky business, but right now he seems to think he can pretend to negotiate without limiting his military attacks and that Trump will hold off on new sanctions or new weapons,\" Sestanovich said. \"If Trump thinks Putin’s approach shows considerable disrespect for him, well, he’s right.\"\nTrump's threat of additional sanctions is one he's made previously, though he's yet to implement them and did not join European countries when they announced last week their own sanctions package against Russia.\nOn Wednesday, Trump was asked what was stopping him from imposing new sanctions.\n\"Only the fact that if I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that. Let me tell you, I'm a lot tougher than the people you're talking about,\" Trump told reporters.\nThere is growing support for economic pressure on Russia among Republicans. In the Senate, a bill from South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham that would impose sanctions on countries that buy Russian energy has more than 80 co-sponsors.\n\"This is not the time for more ‘Vladimir stop.' This is not the time for questions of concern about being pissed off. Those times are passed,\" said Taylor. \"Now is the time, if President Trump is serious, and I think he is serious about ending this war, now's the time for him to take action.\"\nYet just last week, after speaking with Putin, Trump floated he might \"back away\" from talks completely -- and leave it Putin and Zelenskyy to sort things out themselves.\nSuch a move would be a win for the Russian leader, analysts say.\n\"That said, I don't think that President Trump and the administration will walk away because this has been the top priority since before the election and for President Trump to throw up his hands, essentially give in and give up to President Putin, would be an admission of defeat, admission of loss, would give President Putin a big win and would be a stain on President Trump,\" Taylor said.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Russian president Vladimir Putin wants you to believe that NATO is responsible for his February 24 invasion of Ukraine—that rounds of NATO enlargement made Russia insecure, forcing Putin to lash out. This argument has two key flaws. First, NATO has been a variable and not a constant source of tension between Russia and the West. Moscow has in the past acknowledged Ukraine’s right to join NATO; the Kremlin’s complaints about the alliance spike in a clear pattern after democratic breakthroughs in the post-Soviet space. This highlights a second flaw: Since Putin fears democracy and the threat that it poses to his regime, and not expanded NATO membership, taking the latter off the table will not quell his insecurity. His declared goal of the invasion, the “denazification” of Ukraine, is a code for his real aim: antidemocratic regime change.\nRussia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has ignited the largest war in Europe since the Second World War, indiscriminately spilling the blood of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and innocent civilians. Russian president Vladimir Putin wants you to believe that NATO is to blame. He has frequently claimed that NATO expansion—not the 200,000 Russian soldiers and sailors attacking Ukraine’s ports, airfields, roads, railways, and cities—is the central driver of this crisis. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 Foreign Affairs article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.1 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. Multiple rounds of enlargement, they argue, exacerbated Russia’s sense of insecurity as NATO forces crept closer to Russia’s borders, finally provoking Putin to lash out violently, first by invading Georgia in 2008, then Ukraine in 2014, and now a second, likely far larger, invasion of Ukraine today. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.\nThis argument has two flaws, one about history and one about Putin’s thinking. First, NATO expansion has not been a constant source of tension between Russia and the West, but a variable. Over the last thirty years, the salience of the issue has risen and fallen not primarily due to waves of NATO expansion, but instead as a result of waves of democratic expansion in Eurasia. In a very clear pattern, Moscow’s complaints about the alliance spike after democratic breakthroughs. While the tragic invasions and occupations of Georgia and Ukraine have secured Putin a de facto veto over their NATO aspirations, since the alliance would never admit a country under partial occupation by Russian forces, this fact undermines Putin’s claim that the current invasion is aimed at NATO membership. He has already blocked NATO expansion for all intents and purposes, thereby revealing that he wants something far more significant in Ukraine today: the end of democracy and the return of subjugation. On February 24, in an hour-long, meandering rant explaining his decision to invade, he said so directly.\nThis reality highlights the second flaw: Because the primary threat to Putin and his autocratic regime is democracy, not NATO, that perceived threat would not magically disappear with a moratorium on NATO expansion. Putin would not stop seeking to undermine democracy and sovereignty in Ukraine, Georgia, or the region as a whole if NATO stopped expanding. As long as citizens in free countries exercise their democratic rights to elect their own leaders and set their own course in domestic and foreign politics, Putin will continue to try to undermine them. Putin’s declared goal of “denazification” in Ukraine is a code word for regime change—antidemocratic regime change.\nHow We Got Here\nTo be sure, NATO and its expansion have always been sources of tension in U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Russian relations. Two decades ago, one of us coauthored (with James Goldgeier) a book on U.S-Russia relations, Power and Purpose, that includes a chapter called “NATO Is a Four-Letter Word.”2 To varying degrees, Kremlin leaders Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, Putin, and Dmitri Medvedev have expressed concerns about the expansion of the alliance.\nSince its founding in 1949, NATO has kept its door open to new members who meet the criteria for admission. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, no one should be surprised that countries formerly annexed, subjugated, and invaded by the Soviet Union might seek closer security ties to the West. The United States and other NATO allies have worked hard not to deny the aspirations of those newly free societies while also partnering with Russia on European and other security issues. They have sometimes had success and sometimes not.\nMany of those who blame the current Ukraine conflict on NATO overlook the fact that in the thirty years since the end of the Cold War, Moscow’s rejection of NATO expansion has veered in different directions at different times.\nWhen President Boris Yeltsin agreed to sign the Russia-NATO Founding Act in 1997, Russia and the alliance codified into this agreement a comprehensive agenda of cooperation. At the signing ceremony Yeltsin declared,\nWhat is also very important is that we are creating the mechanisms for consultations and cooperation between Russia and the Alliance. And this will enable us—on a fair, egalitarian basis—to discuss, and when need be, pass joint decisions on major issues relating to security and stabilities, those issues and those areas which touch upon our interests.3\nIn 2000 while visiting London, Putin, then serving as acting Russian president, even suggested that Russia could join NATO someday:\nWhy not? Why not . . . I do not rule out such a possibility . . . in the case that Russia’s interests will be reckoned with, if it will be an equal partner. Russia is a part of European culture, and I do not consider my own country in isolation from Europe . . . Therefore, it is with difficulty that I imagine NATO as an enemy.4\nWhy would Putin want to join an alliance allegedly threatening Russia?\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, U.S. president George W. Bush and Putin forged a close, cooperative relationship to fight a common enemy: terrorism. At the time, Putin was focused on cooperation with NATO, not confrontation. The only time the alliance has ever invoked Article 5 on collective defense was to support a NATO intervention in Afghanistan, an action that Putin supported at the UN Security Council. He then followed up this diplomatic support with concrete military assistance for the alliance, including helping the United States to establish military bases in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. If NATO was always a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?\nDuring his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:\nWe differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . . . [But] one can rest assured that whatever final solution is found, it will not threaten . . . the interests of both our countries and of the world.5\nIn an interview that month, Putin declared,\nRussia acknowledges the role of NATO in the world of today, Russia is prepared to expand its cooperation with this organization. And if we change the quality of the relationship, if we change the format of the relationship between Russia and NATO, then I think NATO enlargement will cease to be an issue—will no longer be a relevant issue.6\nWhen NATO announced in 2002 its plan for a major (and last big) wave of expansion that would include three former Soviet republics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—Putin barely reacted. He certainly did not threaten to invade any of the countries to keep them out of NATO. Asked specifically in late 2001 whether he opposed the Baltic states’ membership in NATO, he stated, “We of course are not in a position to tell people what to do. We cannot forbid people to make certain choices if they want to increase the security of their nations in a particular way.”7\nPutin even maintained the same attitude when it was a question of Ukraine someday entering the Atlantic Alliance. In May 2002, when asked for his views on the future of Ukraine’s relations with NATO, Putin dispassionately replied,\nI am absolutely convinced that Ukraine will not shy away from the processes of expanding interaction with NATO and the Western allies as a whole. Ukraine has its own relations with NATO; there is the Ukraine-NATO Council. At the end of the day, the decision is to be taken by NATO and Ukraine. It is a matter for those two partners.8\nA decade later, under President Medvedev, Russia and NATO were cooperating once again. At the 2010 NATO summit in Lisbon, Medvedev declared,\nThe period of distance in our relations and claims against each other is over now. We view the future with optimism and will work on developing relations between Russia and NATO in all areas . . . [as they progress toward] a full-fledged partnership.9\nAt that summit, he even floated the possibility of Russia-NATO cooperation on missile defense. Complaints about NATO expansion never arose.\nFrom the end of the Cold War until Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, NATO in Europe was drawing down resources and forces, not building them up. Even while expanding membership, NATO’s military capacity in Europe was much greater in the 1990s than in the 2000s. During this same period, Putin was spending significant resources to modernize and expand Russia’s conventional forces deployed in Europe. The balance of power between NATO and Russia was shifting in favor of Moscow.\nThese episodes of substantive Russia-NATO cooperation undermine the argument that NATO expansion has always and continuously been the driver of Russia’s confrontation with the West during the last three decades. The historical record simply does not support the thesis that an expanding NATO bears sole blame for Russian antagonism with the West and Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine since 2014. Rather, we must look elsewhere to understand the genuine source of Putin’s hostility to Ukraine and its Western partners.\nThe more serious cause of tensions has been a series of democratic breakthroughs and popular protests for freedom in postcommunist countries throughout the 2000s, which many, including Putin, refer to as the “color revolutions.”10 Putin believes that Russian national interests have been threatened by what he portrays as U.S.-supported coups. After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.\nBoris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Through NATO’s Partnership for Peace program and especially the NATO-Russia Founding Act, Clinton and his team made a considerable effort to keep U.S.-Russian relations positive while at the same time managing NATO expansion. The 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo severely tested that strategy but survived in part because Clinton gave Yeltsin and Russia a role in the negotiated solution. When the first postcommunist color revolution overthrew Slobodan Miloševiæ a year later, Russia’s new president, Putin, deplored the act but did not overreact. At that time, he still entertained the possibility of cooperation with the West, including NATO.\nYet the next round of democratic expansion in the post-Soviet world, the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, escalated U.S.-Russian tensions significantly. Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Immediately after the Rose Revolution, Putin sought to undermine Georgian democracy, ultimately invading in August 2008 and recognizing two Georgian regions—Abkhazia and South Ossetia—as independent states. U.S.-Russian relations reached a new post-Soviet low in 2008.\nA year after the Rose Revolution, the most consequential democratic expansion in the post-Soviet world, the Orange Revolution, erupted in Ukraine in 2004.11 In the years prior to that democratic breakthrough, Ukraine’s foreign-policy orientation under President Leonid Kuchma was relatively balanced between east and west, but with gradually improving ties between Kyiv and Moscow. That changed when a falsified presidential election in late 2004 brought hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians into the streets, eventually sweeping away Kuchma’s—and Putin’s—handpicked successor, Viktor Yanukovych.12 Instead, the prodemocratic and pro-Western Orange Coalition led by President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko took power.\nCompared to Serbia in 2000 or Georgia in 2003, Ukraine’s Orange Revolution was a much larger threat to Putin. First, the Orange Revolution occurred suddenly and in a much bigger and more strategic country on Russia’s border. The abrupt pivot to the West by Yushchenko and his allies left Putin facing the prospect that he had “lost” a country on which he placed tremendous symbolic and strategic importance.\nTo Putin, the Orange Revolution undermined a core objective of his grand strategy: to establish a privileged and exclusive sphere of influence across the territory that once comprised the Soviet Union.13 Putin believes in spheres of influence—that as a great power, Russia has a right to veto the sovereign political decisions of its neighbors. Putin also demands exclusivity in his neighborhood: Russia can be the only great power to exercise such privilege (or even to develop close ties) with these countries. This position has hardened significantly since Putin’s conciliatory stance of 2002 as Russia’s influence in Ukraine has waned and Ukraine’s citizens have repeatedly signaled their desire to escape Moscow’s grasp. Subservience is now required. As Putin explained in a recent article, in his view Ukrainians and Russians are “one people” whom he is seeking to reunite, even if through coercion.14 For Putin, therefore, the 2004 “loss” of Ukraine to the West marked a major negative turning point in U.S.-Russian relations that was far more salient than the second wave of NATO expansion that was completed the same year.\nSecond, those Ukrainians who rose up in defense of their freedom were, in Putin’s own assessment, Slavic brethren with close historical, religious, and cultural ties to Russia. If it could happen in Kyiv, why not in Moscow? Several years later, it almost did occur in Russia when a series of mass protests erupted in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities in the wake of fraudulent parliamentary elections in December 2011.15 They were the largest protests in Russia since 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. For the first time in Putin’s decade-plus in power, ordinary Russians showed themselves to have both the will and the capability to threaten his grip on power.16 That popular uprising in Russia occurred the same year as the Arab Spring and was followed by Putin’s return to the Kremlin as president for a third term in 2012. The combination of these mass protests and Putin’s reelection as president caused another major negative turn in U.S.-Russian relations and ended the “reset” launched by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev in 2009.17 Democratic mobilization, first in the Middle East and then across Russia—not NATO expansion—ended this last chapter of U.S.-Russian cooperation. There have been no new chapters of cooperation since.\nU.S.-Russian relations deteriorated even further in 2014, again because of new democratic expansion, not NATO expansion. The next democratic mobilization to threaten Putin happened again in Ukraine in 2013–14. After the Orange Revolution in 2004, Putin did not invade Ukraine, but wielded other instruments of influence to help his protégé, Viktor Yanukovych, narrowly win the Ukrainian presidency six years later. Yanukovych, however, turned out not to be a loyal Kremlin servant, but tried to cultivate ties with both Russia and the West. Putin finally compelled Yanukovych to make a choice, and the Ukrainian president chose Russia in November 2013 when he reneged on signing an EU association agreement in favor of pursing membership in Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union.\nTo the surprise of everyone in Moscow, Kyiv, Brussels, and Washington, Yanukovych’s decision to scuttle this agreement with the EU triggered mass demonstrations in Ukraine again, with hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians pouring into the streets in what would become known as the EuroMaidan or “Revolution of Dignity” to protest Yanukovych’s turn away from the democratic West. The street protests lasted several weeks, punctuated tragically by the killing of dozens of peaceful protestors by Yanukovych’s government, the eventual collapse of that government and Yanukovych’s flight to Russia in February 2014, and a new pro-Western government taking power in Kyiv. Putin had “lost” Ukraine for the second time in a decade, again because of democratic regime change.\nBut this time, Putin struck back with military force to punish the alleged U.S.-backed, neo-Nazi usurpers in Kyiv. Russian armed forces seized Crimea; Moscow later annexed the Ukrainian peninsula. Putin also provided money, equipment, and soldiers to back separatists in eastern Ukraine, fueling a simmering eight-year war in Donbas that claimed the lives of approximately fourteen-thousand people. After invading—not before—Putin amped up his criticisms of NATO expansion to justify his belligerent actions.\nIn response to this second Ukrainian democratic revolution, Putin concluded that cooptation through elections and other nonmilitary means had to be augmented with greater coercive pressure, including military intervention. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.18 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.\nPutin’s Real Casus Belli: Ukrainian Democracy\nAmazingly, eight years of unrelenting Russian pressure did not break Ukraine’s democracy. Just the opposite. After Putin’s annexation and ongoing support for the war in Donbas, Ukrainians are now more united across ethnic, linguistic, and regional divides than at any other point in Ukrainian history. In 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian presidency in a landslide election, winning popular support in every region of the country. Not surprisingly, Putin’s war in eastern Ukraine also has fueled greater enthusiasm for joining NATO among Ukrainians.\nIn February 2022, Putin embarked on a new strategy for ending Ukrainian democracy: massive military intervention. Putin claims that his purpose is to stop NATO expansion. But that is a fiction. Nothing in Ukraine-NATO relations has changed in the past year. It is true that Ukraine aspires to join NATO someday. (The goal is even embedded in the Ukrainian constitution.) But while NATO leaders have remained committed to the principle of an open-door policy, they also clearly stated prior to the war that Ukraine was not yet qualified to join. Putin’s casus belli is his own invention.\nOn the eve of his invasion, Putin’s strategy to undermine Ukrainian democracy looked as if it might succeed without military force. The very threat of war did significant damage to the Ukrainian economy and fueled new divisions among Ukraine’s political parties over how Zelensky handled the leadup to the crisis. Some argued that Zelensky should have created a new grand coalition or unity government; others lamented his alleged inadequate preparations for war. And some claimed that Zelensky showed his diplomatic inexperience by arguing with U.S. president Joe Biden about the probability of a Russian invasion at a time when unity with the West was most needed.\nBut an impatient and angry Putin could not wait anymore. He attacked with the full might of the Russian armed forces. As this essay goes to print, the war is still raging.\nPutin’s strategy has backfired thus far. Contrary to his expectations, Putin’s use of force has strengthened Ukrainian democracy, not weakened it. His decision to invade Ukraine has united Ukrainians and strengthened Zelensky’s popularity and image as a leader of the nation. While Putin has remained isolated from his subjects and even his own courtiers while his bombs wreak devastation in a far-off land, the charismatic Zelensky has vowed to stay in Kyiv with his soldiers and fight for Ukraine’s democratic future, rallying public opinion in Ukraine and around the world. Putin may still believe that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian nation, as he has claimed on multiple occasions. But just as warfare has forged national identities for centuries, Russia’s aggression has galvanized a Ukrainian people who will forevermore turn their backs on Muscovy’s autocracy, choosing instead to embrace the universal value of freedom—freedom from Russian domination, freedom to choose their own destiny, freedom to live in peace.\nBut despite early Ukrainian successes on the battlefield, the long-term survival of Ukraine’s democracy hangs in the balance. Putin’s continued bellicose rhetoric and rejection of any serious attempts to negotiate a ceasefire suggest that Moscow’s assault will continue unabated. Russia’s initial military operations suggest that Putin envisioned a blitzkrieg invasion from multiple fronts that would face little resistance and rapidly encircle Kyiv, resulting in Zelensky’s forcible removal from power. New elections held at gunpoint would then deliver Putin his desired puppet government, just as they did in post–World War II Eastern Europe in the shadow of Soviet tanks. In one Ukrainian city, Melitopol, in a facsimile of Stalin’s methods in Eastern Europe after 1945, Russia’s occupying forces have already removed the mayor and installed a Moscow puppet. At the time of this writing, however, Russia’s military has been bogged down by fierce Ukrainian resistance and is now settling in for the unpleasant prospect of a long, bloody slog across miles of inhospitable Ukrainian territory. Russia’s armies will be treated by Ukrainians as the occupiers of 1941, not the liberators of 1945. It is too early to predict the outcome of this gruesome war. But despite the Russian army’s poor performance so far, there is no evidence to suggest that Putin has abandoned his objective to remove Zelensky from power and subjugate Ukraine to Moscow’s control.\nPutin may dislike NATO expansion, but he is not genuinely frightened by it. Russia has the largest army in Europe, engorged by two decades of lavish spending. NATO is a defensive alliance. It has never attacked the Soviet Union or Russia, and it never will. Putin knows that. But Putin is threatened by a flourishing democracy in Ukraine. He cannot tolerate a successful and democratic Ukraine on Russia’s border, especially if the Ukrainian people also begin to prosper economically. That would undermine the Kremlin’s own regime stability and proposed rationale for autocratic state leadership. Just as Putin cannot allow the will of the Russian people to guide Russia’s future, he cannot allow the people of Ukraine, who have a shared culture and history, to realize the prosperous, independent, and free future that they have voted and fought for.\nAlthough the chance of a stable ceasefire seems remote today, unprecedented sanctions and growing public dissent within Russia could, in theory, force Putin to the negotiating table. The fog of war is dense. But regardless of where the Russian invaders are stopped—be it Luhansk and Donetsk or Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kherson, Odesa, Kyiv, or Lviv—the Kremlin will remain committed to undermining Ukrainian (and Georgian, Moldovan, Armenian, and the list goes on) democracy and sovereignty for as long as Putin remains in power and maybe longer if Russian autocracy continues. And the Ukrainian people have already proved their mettle: They will fight for their democracy until the day Russian forces leave Ukraine.\nThe views expressed in this essay are the authors’ own and do not reflect the official position of the U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or U.S. Government.\nNOTES\n1.

I mean this guy has done – whether you like him or don’t like him – he’s doing a great job in rebuilding the image of Russia and also rebuilding Russia period,” Trump told Larry King on CNN.\nDecember 2011: Trump praised Putin’s “intelligence” and “no-nonsense way” in his book “Time to Get Tough.”\n“Putin has big plans for Russia. He wants to edge out its neighbors so that Russia can dominate oil supplies to all of Europe,” Trump said. “I respect Putin and Russians but cannot believe our leader (Obama) allows them to get away with so much…Hats off to the Russians.”\nJune 2013: Trump wonders if Putin will be his “new best friend”\n“Will he become my new best friend?” Trump asked of Putin in a tweet wondering whether Putin would attend the 2013 Miss Universe pageant Trump brought to Moscow.\nOctober 2013: Trump says Putin is outsmarting the US\n“I think he’s done really a great job of outsmarting our country,” Trump told Larry King after Putin successfully dissuaded the US from striking Syria by arranging with the US for the removal of Syria’s chemical weapons.\nJuly 31, 2015: Trump says they’d get along\n“I think I’d get along very well with Vladimir Putin. I just think so,” Trump said in one of his first comments about the Russian leader since launching his presidential bid last June.\nOct. 11, 2015: Trump says they had good ratings together\nAsked on CBS’ “Face the Nation” about similarities between him and Putin, Trump pointed to their appearance on same edition of “60 Minutes.”\n“I think the biggest thing we have is that we were on ’60 Minutes’ together and we had fantastic ratings. One of your best-rated shows in a long time,” Trump joked. “So that was good, right? So we were stable mates.”\nTrump said he and Putin “are very different,” but that they would “get along very well.”\n“I think that I would probably get along with him very well. And I don’t think you’d be having the kind of problems that you’re having right now,” Trump said.\nNov. 10, 2015: Trump reiterates that he and Putin “were stablemates”\n“I got to know him very well because we were both on ’60 Minutes,’ we were stablemates, and we did very well that night,” Trump said, despite the fact that he and Putin had been interviewed in separate countries at different times for the same news program.\nIt’s a comment Trump has repeatedly made at rallies.\nDec. 17, 2015: Trump returns Putin’s praise\nDonald Trump issued a statement after Putin praised the real estate mogul as a “talented person” and “the absolute leader of the presidential race.”\n“It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond,” Trump said in a statement. “I have always felt that Russia and the United States should be able to work well with each other towards defeating terrorism and restoring world peace, not to mention trade and all of the other benefits derived from mutual respect.”\nTrump took heat from his GOP rivals for the statement, but refused to back down.\nDec. 18, 2015: Trump defends against allegations Putin has ordered the killings of journalists\n“He’s running his country and at least he’s a leader, unlike what we have in this country,” Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “I think our country does plenty of killing also.”\nFeb. 17: Trump says he’d be “crazy” to disavow Putin’s praise\n“I have no relationship with him other than he called me a genius. He said Donald trump is a genius and he is going to be the leader of the party and he’s going to be the leader of the world or something,” Trump said, embellishing Putin’s praise.\n“These characters that I’m running against said, ‘We want you to disavow that statement.’ I said what, he called me a genius, I’m going to disavow it? Are you crazy? Can you believe it? How stupid are they.”\n“And besides that wouldn’t it be good if we actually got along with countries. Wouldn’t it actually be a positive thing. I think I’d have a good relationship with Putin. I mean who knows,” he continued.\nApril 28: Trump says maybe they’ll get along\n“Maybe we will, maybe we won’t,” Trump says when asked by Bill O’Reilly about whether he and Putin would have a good relationship.\n“I’m saying that I’d possibly have a good relationship. He’s been very nice to me,” Trump said. “If we can make a great deal for our country and get along with Russia that would be a tremendous thing. I would love to try it.”\nJuly 28: Trump says he’d be firm with Putin\n“I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly, but there’s nothing I can think of that I’d rather do than have Russia friendly, as opposed to the way they are right now, so that we can go and knock out ISIS with other people,” Trump said at a news conference.\nBut that wasn’t Trump’s only comment on Putin during the event.\nHe also refused to call on Putin to stay out of the election, “I’m not going to tell Putin what to do. Why would I tell him what to do?”\n“Why do I have to get tough on Putin? I don’t know anything other than that he doesn’t respect our country,” he continued.\nTrump also predicted a better US-Russia relationship under his administration.\n“President Trump would be so much better for US-Russian relations. It can’t be worse,” Trump said.\nAnd of course, Trump said Putin would respect him more than Clinton, his Democratic rival who has been fiercely critical of Putin.\n“I don’t think he has any respect for Clinton. I think he respects me. I think it would be great to get along with him,” Trump said.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Chris Christie’s second term, and with new questions about how Superstorm Sandy funds have been managed, New Jersey voters have dramatically changed their perception of Christie’s job performance on Sandy recovery, according to a new Rutgers-Eagleton Poll. Only 54 percent now approve Christie’s efforts on Sandy, down 15 points since the mid-January poll and a 26-point drop from November 2013. Thirty-six percent disapprove, up 10 points from January, while 10 percent are unsure.\n“These new numbers are a far cry from the nearly unanimous praise the governor had received for post-Sandy leadership,” said David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll and professor of political science at Rutgers University. “We’re seeing a real impact from recent claims involving withheld Sandy aid as political payback, as well as accusations of uneven and inappropriate distribution of recovery funds. This could have a more significant long-term impact than the Fort Lee lane closing scandal that opened Christie’s second term.”\nWhile Sandy job approval has taken a big hit, Christie’s favorability rating (49 percent favorable, 40 percent unfavorable) is statistically unchanged from January (46 to 43 percent). His job approval is stable at 55 percent; 39 percent disapprove, versus 53-41 percent six weeks ago.\n“Positive views of Christie’s Sandy performance kept his overall ratings high throughout 2013,” noted Redlawsk. “The decline in Sandy approval has returned Christie to the pre-Sandy status quo, when about half of voters supported him and the other half did not or was unsure.”\nThe double-digit descent in Christie’s Sandy rating is heavily influenced by the 45 percent of voters who believe the administration withheld Sandy aid from some mayors in retaliation for not receiving their re-election support. Just 41 percent of voters think the allegations are false, while another 13 percent are uncertain.\nResults are from a statewide poll of 842 New Jersey adults with a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points, contacted by live callers on both landlines and cell phones from Feb. 22 to 28. Within this sample are 729 registered voters reported upon in this release, with a margin of error of +/- 3.8 percentage points.\nChristie’s Sandy support erodes\nWhere Christie once enjoyed across-the-board approval for his post-Sandy leadership, divisions have opened. A majority of Democrats no longer praises the governor: just 46 percent now approve his efforts, down 15 points during the past six weeks. Disapproval has jumped to 47 percent of Democrats. But support is also eroding among independents and Republicans. Fifty-four percent of independents continue to approve of Christie’s Sandy work, down 19 points from January. Republican approval dropped a surprising 13 points, to 69 percent.\nApproval of Christie’s Sandy performance was once so strong that even those with an overall unfavorable impression were supportive. That is no longer true. One-third of voters unfavorable toward Christie now approve of how he has handled Sandy recovery, down 18 points from 51 percent approval in January. Nearly two-thirds of this group now disapproves.\nChristie still does well among voters with a favorable overall impression, with almost three-quarters approving his work on Sandy, but this too is down, by 15 points in the last six weeks.\n“When even Republicans show eroding support of a key Christie selling point – his management of the largest natural disaster to hit the state – things are not going well, even if overall favorability ratings look stable for now,” said Redlawsk.\nAmong the recent Sandy-related allegations against the administration have been claims that benefits were withheld from towns where Democratic mayors failed to endorse Christie’s re-election; 45 percent of voters believe these to be true. Among those voters, only 38 percent approve the governor’s performance on Sandy, while 54 percent disapprove. Those who do not believe the claims strongly support Christie’s Sandy work: 73 percent approve, while 19 percent disapprove.\nAll this may boil down to partisan preferences since beliefs about the allegations themselves are heavily divided by partisanship: two-thirds of Democrats say Christie’s administration withheld the funds purposely, versus seven in 10 Republicans who say the opposite. Independents are evenly split on the question – 43 percent (true) and 42 percent (false).\nBridgegate continues to roil New Jersey voters\nThe division over Sandy performance parallels views on the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal. Just over half of voters suspect Christie had knowledge of his advisers’ actions in the closures, while 44 percent do not. Only 16 percent fully believe the governor’s Jan. 9 press conference explanation regarding Bridgegate, down from the 22 percent who said this in January.\nAnother 35 percent say they somewhat believe Christie; 44 percent do not believe him at all. In January, 32 percent somewhat believed the governor, and 42 percent did not.\nDemocrats are most apt to say it is very unlikely Christie did not know of his staff’s actions (51 percent), as well as to disbelieve Christie’s explanation at all (64 percent). Republicans are more supportive: 31 percent say it is somewhat likely and 32 percent say it is very likely Christie was unaware. Just over a third of Republicans fully believe his explanation, while another 41 percent somewhat believes it.\nVoters who cross the George Washington Bridge at least once a week are more likely than less frequent bridge users to think Christie was unaware: 47 percent think it is very unlikely Christie did not know about the plan, and 52 percent do not believe at all the governor’s explanation.\nAsked about the investigation, 38 percent say the state Legislature should continue its effort, but another 30 percent say it should defer to the U.S. Attorney. Almost a quarter says no investigation is needed.\nMore than half of Democrats want the Democratically-controlled Legislature to continue its efforts while 27 percent say the U.S. Attorney should take over. Twelve percent say no investigation is needed. Forty percent of Republicans say all investigations should be ended, while 31 percent say the U.S. Attorney should take the lead. Twenty percent support the Legislature continuing its probe. Independents are more split, with just over a quarter preferring no investigation at all and a third siding with each of the other options. Surprisingly, 37 percent of those who cross the George Washington Bridge at least once a week say no further investigation is necessary, although a plurality (40 percent) would prefer the state to continue.\nDespite challenges, most Christie voters would stick by him\nEven with the developing scandals, New Jerseyans are nowhere near ready to trade in their governor. Just one in five voters think Christie should resign in the face of the investigations, but nearly three-quarters says he should stay in office. Even Democrats are not calling for the governor’s head; just a third say he should resign. Just over three-quarters of independents and 92 percent of Republicans say Christie should remain in office.\nAlmost 90 percent of voters say they would still vote for Christie if they had the chance to vote for governor again. But this does not mean most would vote for him for president. Christie still trails former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, 41 percent to 51 percent, in a 2016 New Jersey head-to-head matchup, although this is a significant improvement from his 34 to 55 percent deficit in January. Asked to name the one person they most want to see as the next president, Christie comes in a distant second to Clinton, drawing fewer than half of the mentions she does.\nOn issues other than Sandy, Christie’s ratings have remained divided. Just over four in 10 approve his work on the economy and taxes and almost half approve his performance on education.\n“In the end, Governor Christie still has a solid base of support among New Jersey voters, even if it is no longer at the record levels we once saw,” said Redlawsk. “In retrospect, it was always unreasonable to expect his post-Sandy ratings would last forever, though we never anticipated how they would fall. Christie’s future may now depend on how well he can pivot to issues that have helped him in the past, including his recent focus on public worker pensions and health care costs. Many New Jerseyans remain happy to stay in his corner, at least for now.”\nEDITOR’S NOTE: ATTENTION POLITICAL, ASSIGNMENT EDITORS, Professor David Redlawsk may be contacted at 319-400-1134 (cell), 732-932-9384, ext. 285 (office), or redlawsk@rutgers.edu until 11 p.m. Questions and tables are available during embargo at http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~redlawsk/EP/Tables2014/EmbargoRelease.html.

There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

Many companies are not subject to the CIT because they are taxed as pass-through businesses, with income reportable under the individual income tax. rates. Eight countries—Barbados, Belarus, Czechia, Fiji, Gibraltar, Iceland, Morocco, and Slovenia—increased their top corporate taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. rates, while five countries—Austria, Cabo Verde, Rwanda, Swaziland, and the Syrian Arab Republic—reduced their corporate tax rates.\n- The countries with the highest corporate tax rates in the world are Comoros (50 percent), Puerto Rico (37.5 percent), and Suriname (36 percent), while the countries with the lowest corporate rates are Turkmenistan (8 percent), Barbados, United Arab Emirates, and Hungary (all at 9 percent). Fifteen jurisdictions do not impose a corporate tax.\n- Five countries with statutory corporate tax rates below 15 percent—Bulgaria, Hungary, Ireland, Lichtenstein, and Barbados—implemented the qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT) rules from the Organisation for Co-operation and Economic Development (OECD) Pillar Two agreement, raising their effective corporate tax rate to 15 percent for large corporations.\n- As of 2024, 28 countries have adopted both the income inclusion rule (IIR) and the QDMTT, three countries—Cyprus, Japan, and the Republic of Korea—have adopted only the IIR, and five countries—Barbados, Gibraltar, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Zimbabwe—have only adopted the QDMTT. Thirty countries are planning to adopt the undertaxed profits rule (UTPR) by the end of 2025.\n- The worldwide average statutory corporate income tax rate, measured across 181 jurisdictions, is 23.51 percent. When weighted by GDP, the average statutory rate is 25.67 percent.\n- Asia has the lowest regional average rate at 19.74 percent, while South America has the highest regional average statutory rate at 28.38 percent. However, when weighted by GDP, Europe has the lowest regional average rate at 24.39 percent and South America has the highest at 32.67 percent.\n- The average top corporate rate among EU Member States is 21.27 percent, 23.85 percent in OECD countries, and 27.15 percent in the G7.\n- When accounting for the global minimum tax, Europe’s average rate raises to 20.53 percent, North America’s average rate raises to 25.84 percent, the OECD’s average rate raises to 24.08 percent, and EU Members States’ average rate raises to 21.77 percent.\n- The worldwide average statutory corporate tax rate has consistently decreased since 1980 but has leveled off in recent years.\n- The average statutory corporate tax rate has declined in every region since 1980.\nIntroduction\nIn 1980, corporate tax rates around the world averaged 40.18 percent, and 46.66 percent when weighted by GDP.[1] Since then, countries have recognized the impact that high corporate tax rates have on business investment decisions; in 2024, the average is now 23.51 percent, and 25.67 when weighted by GDP, for 181 separate tax jurisdictions. [2] When accounting for the global minimum tax, the 2024 average is 23.62 percent, and 25.7 percent when weighted by GDP.[3]\nDeclines have been seen in every major region of the world, including in the largest economies. In the United States, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act brought the country’s statutory corporate income tax rate from the fourth highest in the world closer to the middle of the distribution.[4]\nAsian and European countries tend to have lower corporate income tax rates than countries in other regions, and many developing countries have corporate income tax rates that are above the worldwide average.\nToday, most countries have corporate tax rates below 30 percent.\nNotable Corporate Tax Rate Changes in 2024\nThirteen countries changed their statutory corporate income tax rates in 2024. Eight countries increased their top corporate rates: Morocco (32 percent to 33 percent), Belarus (20 percent to 25 percent), Czechia (19 percent to 21 percent), Gibraltar (12.5 percent to 15 percent), Iceland (20 percent to 21 percent), Slovenia(19 percent to 22 percent), Barbados(5.5 percent to 9 percent) and Fiji (20 percent to 25 percent).\nFive countries across three continents—Cabo Verde, Rwanda, Swaziland, Syrian Arab Republic, and Austria—reduced their corporate tax rates in 2024. The tax rate reductions ranged from just 1 percentage point in Austria and Cabo Verde to 3 percentage points in the Syrian Arab Republic.\nAdditionally, in 2024, five countries with statutory corporate tax rates below 15 percent—Bulgaria, Hungary, Ireland, Lichtenstein, and Barbados—implemented the QDMTT from the Pillar Two rules, raising their effective corporate tax rate for large companies to 15 percent.\nTable 1: Notable Corporate Income Tax Rate Changes in 2024\n| Country | 2023 Tax Rate | 2024 Tax Rate | 2024 Tax Rate Accounting for Global Minimum Tax | Change from 2023 to 2024 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Africa | ||||\n| Cabo Verde | 22.44% | 21.42% | 21.42% | -1.02 ppt |\n| Morocco | 32% | 33% | 33% | +1 ppt |\n| Rwanda | 30% | 28% | 28% | -2 ppt |\n| Swaziland | 27.5% | 25% | 25% | -2.5 ppt |\n| Asia | ||||\n| Syrian Arab Republic | 28% | 25% | 25% | -3 ppt |\n| Europe | ||||\n| Austria | 24% | 23% | 23% | -1 ppt |\n| Belarus | 20% | 25% | 25% | +5 ppt |\n| Bulgaria | 10% | 10% | 15% | 0 ppt/+5 ppt |\n| Czechia | 19% | 21% | 21% | +2 ppt |\n| Gibraltar | 12.5% | 15% | 15% | +2.5 ppt |\n| Hungary | 9% | 9% | 15% | 0 ppt/+6 ppt |\n| Iceland | 20% | 21% | 21% | +1 ppt |\n| Ireland | 12.5% | 12.5% | 15% | 0 ppt/+2.5 ppt |\n| Liechtenstein | 12.5% | 12.5% | 15% | 0 ppt/+2.5 ppt |\n| Slovenia | 19% | 22% | 22% | +3 ppt |\n| North America | ||||\n| Barbados | 5.50% | 9% | 15% | +3.5 ppt /+9.5 ppt |\n| Oceania | ||||\n| Fiji | 20 | 25 | 25 | +5 ppt |\nScheduled Corporate Tax Rate Changes in the OECD and Selected Jurisdictions\nAmong OECD countries, Estonia and Lithuania have announced they will implement changes to their statutory corporate income tax rates in 2025. Additionally, Morocco and Slovenia have enacted changes to their statutory corporate income taxes that will take place over the coming years.\n- In Estonia, the corporate income tax will be increased from 20 percent in 2024 to 22 percent in 2025.[5]\n- In Lithuania, the corporate income tax will increase from 15 percent in 2024 to 16 percent in 2025.[6]\n- In Morocco, the top corporate income tax was increased from 31 percent to 35 percent for companies with a taxable income higher than MAD 100 million (USD 9.9 million). However, this increase will be introduced over three years, with a one percentage point increase each year. For the fiscal year of 2024, the corporate income tax rate applicable is 33 percent.[7]\n- In Slovenia, the top corporate income tax was increased temporarily, from 19 percent to 22 percent, for five years, until 2028. This five-year tax is set to finance the reconstruction efforts after the major floods that occurred in August 2023.[8]\nThe Impact of Global Minimum Tax\nMore than 140 countries have already agreed to a set of rules for a 15 percent global minimum tax, as part of the 2021 global tax agreement coordinated by the OECD. The global minimum tax, also known as Pillar Two, includes three main rules. The first is a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax, which countries could use to claim the first right to tax profits currently being taxed below the minimum effective rate of 15 percent. The second is an income inclusion rule, which determines when the foreign income of a company should be included in the taxable income of the parent company. When a company’s effective tax rate falls below 15 percent, additional taxes would be owed in its home jurisdiction. The third rule in Pillar Two is the undertaxed profits rule, which would allow a country to increase taxes on a company if another related entity in a different jurisdiction was being taxed below the 15 percent effective rate. If multiple countries apply a similar top-up tax, the taxable profit would be divided based on the location of tangible assets and employees.\nThese model rules are incentivizing countries around the world to implement a corporate income tax for the first time.\nThe United Arab Emirates, which introduced a 9 percent federal corporate income tax in 2023, will now impose a minimum top-up tax of 15 percent on large multinational companies operating in the country starting January 1, 2025.[9]\nBermuda has also introduced a minimum 15 percent corporate income tax. In recent years, the Bermuda government extended a tax exemptionA tax exemption excludes certain income, revenue, or even taxpayers from tax altogether. For example, nonprofits that fulfill certain requirements are granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), preventing them from having to pay income tax. granted to Bermuda companies until March 2035. This exemption is supposed to protect companies from any newly enacted taxes on income or capital gains until March 2035. However, in December 2023, Bermuda introduced a 15 percent corporate income tax on multinational companies with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more, effective from 2025.[10]\nAdditionally, in May 2023, the governments of Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man agreed on a joint internal approach to Pillar Two starting in 2025.[11]\nAt the end of 2022, the EU also adopted its own Pillar Two directive. The EU obliges Member States with more than 12 in-scope multinational groups to implement the IIR starting December 31, 2023, and the UTPR starting December 31, 2024. Member States with no more than 12 in-scope multinational groups can elect to defer implementing both rules for six years under Article 50 of the Directive.[12]\nAs of 2024, 28 countries have adopted both the IIR and the QDMTT, three countries—Cyprus, Japan, and the Republic of Korea—have adopted only the IIR, and five countries—Barbados, Gibraltar, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Zimbabwe—have only adopted the QDMTT. Thirty countries are planning to adopt the UTPR rules by the end of 2025, and more than 47 countries are set to adopt at least the QDMTT rules by 2026.[13]\nHowever, while countries are looking for ways to implement the global minimum tax, they are also considering new qualified refundable tax creditA refundable tax credit can be used to generate a federal tax refund larger than the amount of tax paid throughout the year. In other words, a refundable tax credit creates the possibility of a negative federal tax liability. An example of a refundable tax credit is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). incentives for multinational companies allowed under the framework to continue competing for investment.[14]\nThe Highest and Lowest Corporate Tax Rates in the World\nOne hundred and forty-three of the 225 separate jurisdictions surveyed in 2024 have corporate tax rates at or below 25 percent.[15] One hundred and twenty-five have rates above 20 percent but below or at 30 percent. The average rate among the 225 jurisdictions is 23.51 percent.[16] The United States has the 82nd-highest corporate tax rate with a combined federal and state statutory rate of 25.63 percent.[17]\nThe 20 countries with the highest statutory corporate income tax rates span almost every region, albeit unequally. While eight of the top 20 countries are in Africa, Oceania appears only once and Europe twice. Of the remaining jurisdictions, four are in North America, and five are in South America.\nTable 2. 20 Highest Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates in the World, 2024\n| Country | Continent | Tax Rate |\n|---|---|---|\n| Comoros* | Africa | 50% |\n| Puerto Rico | North America | 37.5% |\n| Suriname | South America | 36% |\n| Argentina | South America | 35% |\n| Chad | Africa | 35% |\n| Colombia | South America | 35% |\n| Cuba | North America | 35% |\n| Equatorial Guinea | Africa | 35% |\n| Malta | Europe | 35% |\n| Sudan | Africa | 35% |\n| Sint Maarten (Dutch part) | North America | 34.5% |\n| American Samoa | Oceania | 34% |\n| Brazil | South America | 34% |\n| Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) | South America | 34% |\n| Cameroon | Africa | 33% |\n| Saint Kitts and Nevis | North America | 33% |\n| Morocco | Africa | 32% |\n| Mozambique | Africa | 32% |\n| Namibia | Africa | 32% |\n| Portugal | Europe | 31.5% |\nSource: OECD, “Corporate income tax statutory and targeted small business rates,” updated September 2024; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2024, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates,” accessed November 2024, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380; and researched individually, see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates,” GitHub, https://github.com/TaxFoundation/worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, of the 20 countries with the lowest non-zero statutory corporate tax rates, 18 charge rates at or below 15 percent. Nine countries have statutory rates of 10 percent, five being small European nations (Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Kosovo, and Macedonia). The only two OECD members represented among the bottom 20 countries are Hungary and Ireland. Hungary reduced its corporate income tax rate from 19 to 9 percent in 2017. Ireland has had its 12.5 percent rate in place since 2003. In 2024, of the 18 countries with corporate tax rates below 15 percent, five—Bulgaria, Hungary, Ireland, Lichtenstein, and Barbados—have implemented the QDMTT from the Pillar Two rules, raising their effective corporate tax rate to 15 percent.\nTable 3. 20 Lowest Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates in the World, 2024\n| Country | Continent | Tax Rate | Tax Rate Accounting for Global Minimum Tax |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Turkmenistan | Asia | 8% | 8% |\n| Barbados | North America | 9% | 15% |\n| Hungary | Europe | 9% | 15% |\n| United Arab Emirates | Asia | 9% | 9% |\n| Andorra | Europe | 10% | 10% |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina | Europe | 10% | 10% |\n| Bulgaria | Europe | 10% | 15% |\n| Republic of Kosovo | Europe | 10% | 10% |\n| Kyrgyzstan | Asia | 10% | 10% |\n| Paraguay | South America | 10% | 10% |\n| Qatar | Asia | 10% | 10% |\n| The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia | Europe | 10% | 10% |\n| Timor-Leste | Oceania | 10% | 10% |\n| China, Macao Special Administrative Region | Asia | 12% | 12% |\n| Republic of Moldova | Europe | 12% | 12% |\n| Cyprus | Europe | 12.5% | 12.5% |\n| Ireland | Europe | 12.5% | 15% |\n| Liechtenstein | Europe | 12.5% | 15% |\n| Albania* | Europe | 15% | 15% |\n| Georgia* | Asia | 15% | 15% |\n*Apart from Albania and Georgia, there are 12 other countries with a corporate tax rate of 15 percent that are not shown in this table.\nSource: OECD, “Corporate income tax statutory and targeted small business rates”; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes”; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates”; and researched individually, see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.”\nOf the 225 jurisdictions surveyed, 15 currently do not impose a general corporate income tax. All these jurisdictions are small, island nations. A handful, such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, are well known for their lack of corporate taxes.\nTable 4.

Statutory corporate income tax rate” and “Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates”; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes”; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates.”\nRegional Variation in Corporate Tax Rates\nCorporate tax rates can vary significantly by region. South America has the highest average statutory corporate tax rate among all regions at 28.38 percent. Asia has the lowest average statutory corporate tax rate among all regions at 19.74 percent.\nWhen weighted by GDP, South America has the highest average statutory corporate tax rate at 32.67 percent, while Europe has the lowest at 24.39 percent.\nIn general, larger and more industrialized nations tend to have higher corporate income tax rates than smaller nations. The G7, which is comprised of the seven wealthiest nations in the world, has an average statutory corporate income tax rate of 27.15 percent and a weighted average rate of 26.63 percent. OECD member states have an average statutory corporate tax rate of 23.85 percent and a rate of 26.12 percent when weighted by GDP. The BRICS[18] have an average statutory rate of 27.20 percent and a weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate of 26.22 percent.\nWhen accounting for the global minimum tax, there are no significant changes in the weighted averages of the regions analyzed. However, when comparing the unweighted averages, both Europe (20.53 percent) and North America (25.84 percent) have slightly higher average rates when accounting for the global minimum than without the global minimum tax (20.18 percent and 25.59 percent, respectively). Additionally, when accounting for the global minimum tax, the OECD average rate raises from 23.85 percent to 24.08 percent, while the European Union average raises from 21.27 percent to 21.77 percent.\nTable 5.

Countries in Africa and South America tend to have higher corporate tax rates than Asian and European jurisdictions. Oceania’s and North America’s corporate tax rates tend to be close to the world average.\nDistribution of Corporate Tax Rates\nOnly three tax jurisdictions impose a corporate income tax at statutory rates greater than 35 percent. [19] The following chart shows a distribution of corporate income tax rates among 225 jurisdictions in 2024. A plurality of countries (125 total) impose a rate above 20 percent and below or at 30 percent. Seventeen jurisdictions have a statutory corporate tax rate above 30 percent and below or at 35 percent. Eighty jurisdictions have a statutory corporate tax rate below or at 20 percent, and 205 jurisdictions have a corporate tax rate below or at 30 percent.\nThe Decline of Corporate Tax Rates since 1980 Leveled Off in Recent Years\nOver the past 44 years, corporate tax rates have consistently declined on a global basis. In 1980, the unweighted average worldwide statutory tax rate was 40.18 percent. Today, the average statutory rate stands at 23.51 percent—a 41 percent reduction—and 23.62 percent when accounting for the global minimum tax.[20]\nDespite a general decline in corporate tax rates around the world, OECD and non-OECD countries have also become more reliant on revenue from corporate income taxes. One cause for this change has been a shift in the jurisdictions included.[21] Secondly, the negative revenue impact of the decline in corporate tax rates was generally offset by reducing or abolishing tax relief policies. [22]\nThe weighted average statutory rate has remained higher than the simple average over this period. Prior to US tax reform in 2017, the United States was largely responsible for keeping the weighted average higher, given its relatively high tax rate, as well as its significant contribution to global GDP. Figure 4 shows the significant impact the change in the US corporate rate had on the worldwide weighted average. The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate has declined from 46.66 percent in 1980 to 25.67 percent (25.7 percent when accounting for the global minimum tax) in 2024, representing a 45 percent reduction over the 44 years surveyed.\nOver time, more countries have shifted to taxing corporations at rates of 30 percent or lower, with the United States following this trend with its tax changes at the end of 2017. The largest shift occurred between 1990 and 2000, with 49 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2000 and only 27 percent of countries in the dataset imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 1990. This trend continued between 2000 and 2010, with 79 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2010. Currently, 91 percent of countries impose a statutory rate below 30 percent.[23]\nAll regions saw a net decline in average statutory rates between 1980 and 2024. The average declined the most in Europe, with the 1980 average of 44.6 percent dropping to 20.18 percent (20.53 percent when accounting for the global minimum tax)—a 55 percent decline. South America has seen the smallest decline, with the average only decreasing by 23 percent, from 36.66 percent in 1980 to 28.38 percent in 2024.\nSouth America saw two periods, 1990-2000 and 2010-2024, during which the average statutory rate increased slightly by less than 0.5 percentage points, although the average rate decreased over the full 44-year period.\nConclusion\nWorldwide and regional average top statutory corporate tax rates have declined over the past four decades due to countries turning to more efficient tax types.[24] However, they have leveled off in recent years. Of the 225 jurisdictions around the world, only eight have increased their top corporate income tax rates in 2024, while five low-tax jurisdictions raised their effective corporate tax rates by implementing the global minimum tax, a trend that might be reversed in the coming years as more countries will be implementing the global minimum tax.\nCompare All 2024 Corporate Tax Rates\nTable 6.

states and dependent territories around the world. Tax rates were researched only for jurisdictions that are among the around 250 sovereign states and dependent territories that have been assigned a country code by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). As a result, zones or territories that are independent taxing jurisdictions but do not have their own country code are generally not included in the dataset.\nIn addition, the dataset includes historic statutory corporate income tax rates from 1980 to 2022. However, these years cover tax rates of fewer than 225 jurisdictions due to missing data points. Please let Tax Foundation know if you are aware of any sources for historic corporate tax rates that are not mentioned in this report, as we constantly strive to improve our datasets.\nTo be able to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates weighted by GDP, the dataset includes GDP data for 181 jurisdictions. When used to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates, either weighted by GDP or unweighted, only these 181 jurisdictions are included (to ensure the comparability of the unweighted and weighted averages).\nDefinition of Selected Corporate Income Tax Rate\nThe dataset captures standard top statutory corporate income tax rates levied on domestic businesses. This means:\n- The dataset does not reflect special tax regimes, including but not limited to patent boxes, offshore regimes, or special rates for specific industries.\n- A number of countries levy lower rates for businesses below a certain revenue threshold. The dataset does not capture these lower rates.\n- A few countries levy gross revenue taxes on businesses instead of corporate income taxes. Since the tax rates of a corporate income tax and a gross revenue tax are not comparable, these countries are excluded from the dataset.\n- Some countries have a separate tax rate for nonresident companies. This dataset does not consider nonresident tax rates that differ from the general corporate rate.\nSources\nTax Rates for the Year 2024\nFor OECD and non-OECD countries, the statutory corporate income tax rates used are the combined corporate income tax rates provided by the OECD; see OECD, “Corporate income tax statutory and targeted small business rates,” updated September 2024. Another source used for non-OECD jurisdictions is the statutory rates provided by PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2024, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/. The study also relies on Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates,” accessed in November 2024, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380. Jurisdictions that are not part of these sources were researched individually. The source for each of these jurisdictions is listed in a GitHub repository; see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates,” GitHub, https://github.com/TaxFoundation/worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.\nTo calculate the 2024 tax rates accounting for the global minimum tax, the Pillar Two country tracker was used; see PwC, “Pillar Two Country Tracker,” accessed Dec. 2, 2024, https://pwc.com/gx/en/services/tax/pillar-two-readiness/country-tracker.html.\nTax Rates for the Years 1980-2023\nTax rates for the time frame between 1980 and 2023 are taken from a dataset compiled by the Tax Foundation over the last few years.

For 2024, the dataset includes statutory corporate income tax rates of 225 jurisdictions, but GDP data is available for only 181 of these jurisdictions, reducing the number of jurisdictions included in calculated averages to 181. For years prior to 2024, the number of countries included in calculated averages varies by year due to missing corporate tax rates; that is, the 1980 average includes statutory corporate income tax rates of 75 jurisdictions, compared to 181 jurisdictions in 2024.\n[2] Statutory rates are from OECD, “Corporate income tax statutory and targeted small business rates,” updated September 2024; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2023, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates,” accessed November 2023, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380; and researched individually, see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates,” GitHub, https://github.com/TaxFoundation/worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.

International tax reform feeds into our most important tax policy goals: building a tax system that is fit for purpose, fair, and focused on the needs of all Americans.\nIn my testimony today, I will discuss several crucial issues related to international tax reform. First, we need better protections to defend the U.S. corporate tax base from the tax-motivated shifting of corporate profits to offshore havens. Second, international tax reform is an essential ingredient in building a fairer tax system. Third, it is important to modernize our tax system to better suit a globally integrated economy, reducing the tax preference in favor of foreign operations, and enabling U.S. workers to compete on a level playing field. Most important, all our tax system choices must serve the interests of all Americans.\nFortunately, there are relatively straightforward changes that we can make, that will vastly improve our international tax regime. These include a stronger, more robust minimum tax and steadfast work with our partners and allies abroad in order to counter the pressures of international tax competition.\nBuilding a Tax System that Is Fit for Purpose\nInternational tax reform is essential to our most important tax policy goals. After the tax cuts of prior years, we now raise only about 16 percent of GDP in federal tax revenue. (To put this into perspective, the last time the U.S. balanced the federal budget, receipts were about 20 percent of GDP.) And, while the pandemic necessitated a large and robust fiscal response in the near term, it will be important to build a tax system that can contribute to our many important fiscal priorities, including lasting investments in infrastructure, research, and clean energy. At the same time, it is essential not to raise taxes on typical workers, who have often not felt the beneficial effects of our strong economic growth.\nCompared to our trading partners, the U.S. government raises very little corporate tax revenue. For many years, the typical OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) country has raised about 3 percent of GDP from corporate taxation, whereas in 2018 and 2019 (before the pandemic occurred), the United States raised only 1 percent of GDP from the corporate tax. Even before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the United States was below peer nations, collecting only 2 percent of GDP. Indeed, corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP have been trending downwards in the United States since the 1950s.[1]\nCorporate Tax Revenues Relative to GDP\n|\n|\nUnited States |\nOECD Average[2] |\n|\nPost TCJA: 2018/2019 |\n1.0 |\n3.1 |\n|\n5 Years pre TCJA: 2013-2017 |\n2.0 |\n2.9 |\n|\nYears Prior: 2000-2012 |\n2.0 |\n3.0 |\nData Source: OECD Revenue Statistics\nCorporate tax revenues are low despite the fact that U.S. companies produce very high corporate profits, both in historic and comparative terms. For example, in recent years, corporate profits (after-tax) as a share of GDP averaged 9.7 percent (2005-2019), whereas in the period 1980-2000, corporate profits averaged only 5.4 percent of GDP.[3]\nIndeed, the U.S. corporate sector is the most successful in the world; the United States hosts 37 percent of the Forbes Global 2000 top companies’ profits, despite the fact that the United States only comprises 24 percent of world GDP and less than 5 percent of the world’s population.[4]\nYet, despite the enormous success of the corporate sector, U.S. companies continue to shift corporate profits offshore, reducing the U.S. corporate tax base and U.S. tax revenues. As of 2017, corporate profit shifting by both U.S. and foreign multinational companies cost the U.S. government approximately $100 billion per year at prior tax rates.[5] Although revenue loss is mechanically lower at today’s lower corporate income tax rates, recent data indicate that the role of foreign tax havens was quite similar in 2018 and 2019 as it was in the years before the 2017 law.\nAlthough the 2017 law contained two modest measures that were supposed to reduce profit shifting (the GILTI minimum tax, for global intangible low-tax income, and the BEAT, for base-erosion anti-abuse tax), the 2017 law also encouraged profit shifting in other ways, by exempting from U.S. taxation the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and by taxing foreign profits at half the rate of U.S. profits.\nThe Share of U.S. Multinational Corporation Income in Seven Big Havens, 2000-2019\nNote: Data are foreign investment earnings data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The seven low-tax jurisdictions that are particularly important in these data are: Bermuda, the Caymans, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Switzerland. The haven share is mechanically higher than it would be in some data sources since the data are reported on an after-tax basis.\nBased on the early evidence in the two years after the law, the use of tax havens to avoid tax continues unabated. As the figure above illustrates, the share of total foreign income in seven prominent tax havens is nearly identical in the two years after the law (2018 and 2019) as it was in the five year prior to the law, at 61 percent of after-tax income, or 1.5 percent of GDP.\nBuilding a Fairer Tax System\nImproving international taxation will do more than raise much-needed revenue. It will also improve the progressivity of our tax system, ensuring that large corporations—and those that own them—pay their fair share.\nThe corporate tax is one of the most progressive taxes in our tax system, far more progressive than the individual income tax or the payroll tax. Economic models from organizations as varied as the U.S. Treasury, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office, the Tax Policy Center, and the American Enterprise Institute all agree that the vast majority of the corporate tax burden falls on the owners of capital and those with excess profits.\nRecent decades have witnessed a worrisome increase in economic inequality, combined with a falling labor share of income. At the same time, governments throughout the world have too often responded by shifting relative burdens away from capital, reducing tax rates on capital gains, dividends, and corporate income, while increasing relative tax burdens on other income. Instead of dampening economic inequality, the tax system has too often exacerbated it. In part, these policy changes may have been a response to the fact that capital is more mobile than labor, as it is easier to offshore a factory (and even easier to offshore paper profits) than it is to move a person (or their labor income).\nYet policy-makers have not sufficiently modernized the tax system to make it more suited to these global forces. The changes outlined below will go much further toward that end. It is also essential to remember that shifting the capital tax burden to individuals, rather than businesses, will still leave much capital income untaxed, unless long held tax preferences are completely rethought. At present, about 70 percent of U.S. equity income goes untaxed by the U.S. government at the individual level.[6] (Indeed, some U.S. equities are also held by foreigners, whose residence countries may or may not tax that income at home. When corporate rates are cut, large benefits accrue to foreign investors.)\nIn addition to enhancing the progressivity of the U.S. tax system, the corporate tax is also efficient, since taxing excess profits can generate revenue without undue distortion, and evidence indicates that a rising share of the tax base, now likely over three quarters, is comprised of excess returns.[7] Finally, a majority of voters in both parties favor higher taxes on corporations.[8]\nBuilding an Economy that Meets the Needs of All Americans\nOur modern global economy generates enormous churn. Forces such as transformative technological change, rising market power, import competition, declining unionization, and changing social norms have left many workers with economic outcomes that fall short of long-held expectations. Nearly 90 percent of children born in the 1940s out-earned their parents, but that share has fallen steadily. For children born in 1970, only 60 percent out-earn their parents; for those born in the 1980s, only half do.[9]\nThose left behind by economic disruption are looking for answers. Some policy solutions, such as reinvigorating labor law to give workers greater economic power and investing in infrastructure and community colleges in left-behind regions, can be quite helpful. Others, such as erecting immigration barriers, risk adding insult to injury. Immigration is a vital source of job creation and innovation in the U.S. economy; turning our back on immigrants and foreign students weakens one of our most essential advantages.[10]\nYet we can do a lot more to ensure our tax system works for American workers. Expanding the earned income tax credit rewards work for those that are struggling, and expanding the child tax credit is an enormous anti-poverty tool. Both of these were enacted as part of the American Rescue Plan. In corporate tax, it is important to reduce the large tilt in the playing field that favors foreign income and to work with partner countries to lessen the pressures of tax competition. A stronger minimum tax, stronger measures to tackle the profit shifting of foreign multinational companies, and close cooperation with our allies all have an important role to play.\nBuilding a 21st Century Tax System\nThe American Rescue Plan provided an essential down payment, expanding child tax credits and earned income tax credits, both measures that go to the heart of creating inclusive, worker-focused prosperity. But we also need to build business tax systems that can handle the global mobility of capital.\nMultinational corporations can reasonably be asked to pay their fair share. At present, U.S. corporations pay income tax at only a 21 percent rate, a lower marginal tax rate than that faced by many schoolteachers and firefighters.[11] Multinational companies operating offshore receive even more favorable tax treatment. Under the GILTI minimum tax, the first ten percent return on tangible assets is completely free of U.S. tax, and subsequent income is taxed with a 50 percent deduction, facing tax at approximately half the full U.S. rate.[12] Our tax system would benefit from a much stronger minimum tax.\nBuilding Multilateral Cooperation in International Tax\nWe are not alone in worrying about the profit shifting of multinational companies. Since 2013, there has been an ongoing international effort at cooperation in this area, led by the OECD and G20 countries, referred to as BEPS (for base erosion and profit shifting). The first round of negotiations made some modest progress in several areas, but ultimately was not transformational, as tax avoidance techniques that were shut down sprung back in different forms, and multinational company profit shifting continued in a manner similar to years prior.\nPresently, a second round of negotiations is centered around addressing two problems: rethinking the allocation of taxing rights in a modern economy (so called “Pillar One”), and ensuring that all companies pay some minimum level of tax (“Pillar Two”). Within these efforts, a country-by-country minimum tax is presently being proposed internationally.\nIn general, there is strong policy interest in solving these vexing international tax problems, and countries’ efforts can be mutually reinforcing. For instance, governments levying minimum taxes generate positive fiscal spillovers for each other’s tax bases, by substantially reducing the incentive of their resident multinational companies to shift profits away from all non-haven tax bases toward tax havens. Further, U.S. leadership in international tax reform may incentivize stronger action abroad.\nWorking with our allies and friends in order to build better tax laws can help nations cooperate to solve other global collective action problems, not just stopping excessive tax competition pressures in corporate tax, but also using these vital international collaborations to work productively to handle issues like climate change, global public health, and other serious threats.\nBuilding Consensus\nSeveral hurdles stand in the way of international reforms, but they are not insurmountable.\nConcerns about the competitiveness of U.S. multinationals ignore the evidence. Both before and after the 2017 Tax Act, U.S. multinational companies are the envy of the world, not just for their high profits and market capitalization, but also for their tax planning acumen. U.S. multinational companies paid similar effective tax rates as peers in other countries, even before the 2017 Tax law dramatically lowered U.S. corporate tax rates. And, U.S. corporate tax revenues are far lower than those in peer countries, as shown in the table above.\nFurther, to the extent that foreign countries also adopt strong minimum taxes, that will also reduce any competitiveness worries, while protecting our tax base from the profit shifting of foreign multinational companies. In fact, the present moment is an ideal time to reform our international tax rules, since there is a strong international consensus around addressing these problems, and our action can encourage action abroad.\nFinally, it is important to remember that competitiveness is about more than the success of U.S. companies in foreign merger and acquisition bids. It is also about ensuring that our tax code doesn’t incentivize foreign operations at the expense of those at home. And, it is about nurturing the many fundamental strengths that make the United States a good place to do business. Investing in our institutions, in the abilities, education, and economic power of American workers, in the quality of our infrastructure, and in cutting-edge research is all important. It is also important to work harmoniously with other countries in order to ensure a smooth and stable trading system, and in order to seriously address common concerns such as climate change and public health.\n[1] Data from Tax Policy Center. “Corporate Income Tax as a Share of GDP, 1956-2018.” https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/corporate-income-tax-share-gdp-1946-2018\n[2] The average for G7 countries is very similar.\n[3] Data are from the Federal Reserve Economics Statistics database.\n[4] Data are from 2020 Forbes Global 2000 list.\n[5] See Clausing, Kimberly. “Profit Shifting Before and After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” 2020.

If they are operating only in zero-tax jurisdictions, they pay tax at 10.5 percent, but the rate can be as high as 13.125 percent if income is blended with income from higher-tax countries, since foreign tax rates are only 80 percent creditable.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Key Findings\n- Many developed countries have repealed their net wealth taxes in recent years. Among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, only four currently impose one: Colombia, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland.\n- Countries have repealed their wealth taxes for a variety of reasons. They raise little revenue, create high administrative costs, and induce an outflow of wealthy individuals and their money. Many policymakers have also recognized that high taxes on capital and wealth damage economic growth.\n- The flawed design of these taxes has created problems in countries that have implemented them. In 1997, the German Constitutional Court declared the wealth taxA wealth tax is imposed on an individual’s net wealth, or the market value of their total owned assets minus liabilities. A wealth tax can be narrowly or widely defined, and depending on the definition of wealth, the base for a wealth tax can vary. unconstitutional. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the wealth taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. violates European law regarding property rights and non-discrimination. In 2023, the regional governments of Madrid, Andalusia, and Galicia appealed the new “solidarity wealth tax” to the Spanish Constitutional Court.\n- Wealth taxes generate double or even triple taxation. For safe investments like bonds or bank deposits, a wealth tax of 2 or 3 percent may confiscate all interest earnings, leaving no increase in savings over time. Additionally, if the individual’s wealth is not growing at a rate higher than the tax rate, the tax will ultimately reduce that individual’s wealth.\n- In the case of Spain, the combination of personal capital income taxes and net wealth taxes results in marginal tax rates well above 100 percent. This means that the entire real return on investment is taxed away and, by saving, the real value of people’s wealth shrinks. Spain is the only country in the world that in addition to net wealth and capital gains taxes also levies taxes on capital transfers, a financial transaction tax, and one of the highest inheritance and gift taxes in Europe.\n- Wealth taxes disincentivize entrepreneurship, leading to less innovation and less long-term growth. A wealth tax reduces wages, destroys jobs, and reduces the stock of capital. All income groups are worse off under a wealth tax due to decreased economic activity.\n- Wealth taxes account for a very small share of tax revenues. In 2022, tax revenues from individual net wealth taxes ranged from 0.19 percent of GDP in Spain to 1.19 percent of GDP in Switzerland. As a share of total tax revenues, they ranged from 0.51 percent in Spain to 4.35 percent in Switzerland.\n- Even a small increase in the wealth tax rate can lead to capital flight and wealthy individuals relocating to neighboring jurisdictions. For example, after a 1 percent increase in Norway’s wealth tax, many high-net-worth individuals left the country. In 2023, after Spain introduced a new “solidarity wealth tax,” Portugal extended its tax regime for nonresidents since more Spanish taxpayers were considering changing their tax residence.\n- A global agreement on a net wealth tax is highly improbable since a critical number of countries would need to sign the agreement—including Switzerland, where taxpayers must approve any tax increases—making this proposal unfeasible. Additionally, wealth can move beyond borders to any country that is unwilling to sign the agreement.\nIntroduction\nThe United Nations, the EU Tax Observatory, the European Union, and even G-20 countries are eyeing new wealth taxes and a global agreement on a net wealth tax.[1] At the same time, Spain has recently enforced a new solidarity wealth tax on top of the current regional wealth taxes.[2] Over the last three decades, most EU countries have repealed their net wealth taxes, acknowledging that wealth taxes disincentivize entrepreneurship and harm innovation and long-term growth.\nThe current discussions about proposed wealth taxes have included little or skewed information about the trends in wealth taxation across developed countries. However, these trends, and the current state of wealth taxes in countries across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), can provide context for the proposals.\nWealth Taxes around the World\nNet wealth taxes are recurrent taxes on an individual’s wealth, net of debt. The concept of a net wealth tax is similar to a real property taxA property tax is primarily levied on immovable property like land and buildings, as well as on tangible personal property that is movable, like vehicles and equipment. Property taxes are the single largest source of state and local revenue in the U.S. and help fund schools, roads, police, and other services.. But instead of only taxing real estate, it covers all wealth an individual owns.\nWhich Countries Impose Wealth Taxes?\nMany developed countries have repealed these taxes in recent years, including Austria (1994); Denmark and Germany (1997); the Netherlands (2001); Finland, Iceland, and Luxembourg (2006); and Sweden (2007).[3] France was the last country to repeal its wealth tax in 2018, replacing it with a real estate wealth tax. Among OECD countries, there are just four—Colombia, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland—that currently impose one.[4] Even among these four countries, the tax rates and bases vary.\nColombia levies a progressive net wealth tax ranging from 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent on wealth stock above COP 3.38 billion (EUR 0.8 million or USD 0.86 million). From 2027 onward, the tax rate will be reduced to 1 percent.\nNet Wealth Taxes in Europe\nIn Europe, only three countries levy net wealth taxes—Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. France and Italy levy wealth taxes on selected assets but not on an individual’s net wealth per se.[5]\nNorway levies a net wealth tax of 1 percent on individuals’ wealth stocks exceeding NOK 1.7 million (EUR 150,000 or USD 160,000), with 0.7 percent going to municipalities and 0.3 percent to the central government. Norway’s net wealth tax dates to 1892. Additionally, for net wealth exceeding NOK 20 million (EUR 1.74 million or USD 1.88 million), the tax rate is 1.1 percent.\nSpain’s net wealth tax is a progressive taxA progressive tax is one where the average tax burden increases with income. High-income families pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden, while low- and middle-income taxpayers shoulder a relatively small tax burden. ranging from 0.16 percent (in Navarra) to 3.5 percent on wealth stocks above EUR 700,000 (USD 752,783; lower in some regions), with rates varying substantially across Spain’s autonomous regions (Andalusia, Extremadura, and Madrid offer 100 percent relief). Spanish residents are subject to the tax on a worldwide basis while nonresidents pay the tax only on assets located in Spain.\nAdditionally, the Spanish central government introduced a “solidarity wealth tax” in 2022 and 2023 (to be collected in 2023 and 2024) ranging from 1.7 percent to 3.5 percent on individuals with net assets exceeding EUR 3 million (USD 3.23 million).[6] Under this new tax scheme, the central government collects any additional revenue from the solidarity tax once the regional wealth tax collection is deducted. Consequently, Madrid, Extremadura, and Andalusia restored the wealth tax so that the regional governments retain the revenues the central government plans to collect in 2024. Additionally, three other regions raised the exception threshold to EUR 3 million (Balearic Island and Cantabria) and EUR 3.7 million (Murcia) to equal the tax relief offered by Andalusia, Extremadura, and Madrid.\nSwitzerland levies its net wealth tax at the cantonal level and covers worldwide assets (except real estate and permanent establishments located abroad). The tax rates and allowances vary significantly across cantons. The Swiss net wealth tax was first implemented in 1840.\nWealth Taxes on Selected Assets\nFrance abolished its net wealth tax in 2018 and replaced it that year with a real estate wealth tax. French tax residents whose net worldwide real estate assets are valued at or above EUR 1.3 million (USD 1.40 million) are subject to the tax, as well as non-French tax residents whose net real estate assets located in France are valued at or above EUR 1.3 million. Depending on the net value of the real estate assets, the tax rate ranges from .5 percent to 1.5 percent.\nItaly taxes financial assets held abroad by individual resident taxpayers without Italian intermediaries at 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent for assets held in certain countries. In addition, real estate properties held abroad by Italian tax residents are taxed at 1.06 percent in 2024, up from 0.76 percent in 2023.\nSince 2021, Belgium has had a solidarity tax or tax on securities accounts (TSA) of 0.15 percent on securities accounts with an average value of EUR 1 million (USD 1.08 million).\nIn the Netherlands, the value of net wealth, excluding primary residence and substantial interests in companies, is included in the income tax. Nevertheless, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that this system violates European law regarding property rights and non-discrimination. In 2022, a new temporary alternative system for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025 was proposed where each asset category (e.g., savings, debts, and others) would have its own deemed return. For 2024, the weighted average yield over all categories will be applied to the total assets above a personal exemption of EUR 57,000 (USD 61,298) to determine the taxable benefit that will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 36 percent. The government is aiming to have a new system based on actual returns by 2026.\nWhy Wealth Taxes Should Be (and Have Been) Abolished\nCountries have repealed their wealth taxes for a variety of reasons: they raise little revenue, create high administrative costs, and induce an outflow of wealthy individuals and their money. Many policymakers have also recognized that high taxes on capital and wealth damage economic growth.\nWealth Taxes Create Legal Challenges\nOne reason wealth taxes should be repealed is because they generate legal challenges.\nIn January 1997, the German Constitutional Court concluded that the preferential treatment of real estate over other assets, such as bank deposits, did not comply with the principle of equality and declared the German wealth tax unconstitutional. The wealth tax was introduced in Germany in 1952 as a general tax on net wealth, at a relatively low rate of 1 percent. The wealth tax barely managed to collect 0.3 percent of the total tax revenue, representing 0.1 percent of GDP.\nIn the Netherlands, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that this system violates European law regarding property rights and non-discrimination. In spite of a new temporary alternative introduced in 2022—for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025—the Supreme Court ruled in June 2024 that the new wealth tax is still discriminatory, and savers and investors should be compensated on the high tax rates paid on fictitious returns.[7]\nIn 2023, the wealth tax developments in Spain pushed the regional governments of Madrid, Andalusia, and Galicia to appeal the new “solidarity wealth tax” to the Constitutional Court.[8] When the court ruled in December 2023 that the solidarity wealth tax was constitutional (despite what experts argued), the Spanish central government then extended the solidarity tax’s application until the regional financing system was reformed.[9]\nWealth Taxes Generate Double TaxationDouble taxation is when taxes are paid twice on the same dollar of income, regardless of whether that’s corporate or individual income. and Could Be Confiscatory in Some Instances\nNet wealth taxes generate double or even triple taxation. If wealth is accumulated from wage earnings or personal business income, then these flows will have already been taxed. Taxpayers would have already paid capital gains and dividend taxes on earnings from capital assets, income taxes, property taxes, and other taxes. If households accumulate wealth to smooth consumption over their lifetime, wealth will be taxed again when it is used for consumption.\nWealth taxes apply a tax rate to an individual’s net wealth, usually above a certain threshold. A person with EUR 2.5 million in wealth and EUR 500,000 in debt would have a net wealth of EUR 2 million. If the tax applies to all wealth above EUR 1 million, then under a 5 percent wealth tax the individual would owe EUR 50,000 in taxes. Compared to income taxes, wealth tax rates seem much lower, but this rate can be deceptive.\nThe best way to interpret wealth tax rates is to translate them into an equivalent income tax rate. For example, consider an investor who owns a long-term bond with a fixed rate of return at 5 percent each year. A 3 percent annual wealth tax would imply that 60 percent of the capital income from owning the long-term bond would be remitted as tax—the 3 percent wealth tax translates to a 60 percent income tax rate in this example. A 5 percent annual wealth tax would equal a 100 percent income tax rate because the wealth tax would take all this taxpayer’s capital income. A 10 percent wealth tax, calculated in the same manner, implies that all capital income earned in this year plus part of the stock would have to be turned over as taxes, which means a 200 percent income tax.\nTable 1. A Wealth Tax Rate of 3 Percent May Confiscate All Interest Earnings\n| Pre-Tax Return | Annual Wealth Tax Rate | Implied Income Tax Rate | After-Tax Return | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Scenario A | 5% | 2% | 40% | 3% |\n| Scenario B | 5% | 3% | 60% | 2% |\n| Scenario C | 5% | 5% | 100% | 0% |\n| Scenario D | 5% | 10% | 200% | -5% |\nFor safe investments like bonds or bank deposits, a wealth tax of 2 or 3 percent may confiscate all interest earnings, leaving no increase in savings over time. A wealth tax of 6 or 8 percent will reduce wealth accumulation for low-risk and low-return investments. Asset owners with a 6 or 8 percent return on higher-risk investments may still be able to accumulate wealth. However, they will face taxes on their assets return in the form of capital gains and dividend taxes. Other taxes, like property taxes or transfer taxes, can also apply.\nHow does a 5 percent wealth tax impact investors with different pre-tax return rates? For three investors with different pre-tax returns, as specified in Table 2, a 5 percent wealth tax results in different tax burdens. For a lower-return asset with a 2 percent pre-tax return, a 5 percent wealth tax means a 250 percent effective tax rate, but the same wealth tax applied to a return of 10 percent results in a 50 percent tax on its return.\nTable 2. Wealth Tax on Different Rates of Returns\n| Pre-Tax Return | Annual Wealth Tax Rate | Equivalent Income Tax Rate | After-Tax Return | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Scenario A | 2% | 5% | 250% | -3% |\n| Scenario B | 5% | 5% | 100% | 0% |\n| Scenario C | 10% | 5% | 50% | 5% |\nTherefore, a wealth tax would be less neutral toward normal rates of returns, placing a higher burden on those at the margin of deciding whether to consume now or invest for the future. On the other hand, a wealth tax is more lenient toward higher or supernormal rates of return; investors achieving supernormal returns will be less sensitive to the extra layer of wealth tax since their wealth tax burden would be relatively lower.\nAdditionally, if the individual’s wealth is not growing at a rate higher than the tax rate, the tax will ultimately reduce that individual’s wealth. This means that individuals with lower rates of return on their wealth will face higher effective tax rates.\nThe large distortive effect of wealth taxes comes from the fact that when wealth taxes are levied, they are often imposed on top of capital income taxes. If imposed on top of high income taxes, a net wealth tax can significantly increase marginal effective tax rates (METRs), especially at higher inflationInflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy, reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets. The same paycheck covers less goods, services, and bills. It is sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax,” as it leaves taxpayers less well-off due to higher costs and “bracket creep,” while increasing the government’s spendin rates and lower real rates of return. In these cases, wealth taxes not only discourage saving but can potentially encourage disinvestment.\nThe cumulative nature of a net wealth tax and its potentially negative effects on saving and investment depends on the rest of the tax system and interactions with other taxes on capital. Some of the countries that levy net wealth taxes do not impose taxes on the transfer of capital or on capital gains. For instance, in Switzerland, there is no capital gains taxA capital gains tax is levied on the profit made from selling an asset and is often in addition to corporate income taxes, frequently resulting in double taxation. These taxes create a bias against saving, leading to a lower level of national income by encouraging present consumption over investment. on movable assets (for example, shares of stock in a company) unless the owner professionally trades securities and almost all cantons have abolished taxes on inheritance and gifts from parents to children. The Swiss wealth tax substitutes a capital gains tax and an estate taxAn estate tax is imposed on the net value of an individual’s taxable estate, after any exclusions or credits, at the time of death. The tax is paid by the estate itself before assets are distributed to heirs., which are common in other countries. In Norway, the inheritance taxAn inheritance tax is levied upon the value of inherited assets received by a beneficiary after a decedent’s death. Not to be confused with estate taxes, which are paid by the decedent’s estate based on the size of the total estate before assets are distributed, inheritance taxes are paid by the recipient or heir based on the value of the bequest received. was repealed. Spain, in addition to net wealth taxes, levies taxes on capital transfers, capital gains, a financial transaction tax, and one of the highest inheritance and gift taxes in Europe.[10]\nHowever, the Spanish system and certain Swiss cantons feature a cap on the sum of wealth and income taxes as a fraction of taxable income. Additionally, the wealth tax in Spain also features a minimum amount of 20 percent (25 percent in some regions) of the wealth tax liability. Such a cap limits the liquidity problem of a high ratio of income plus wealth tax liability to disposable income. However, this doesn’t stop the wealth tax from wiping out all returns on investment.\nFigure 3 shows the METRs with and without wealth taxes on different types of assets for taxpayers subject to the top personal income tax and net wealth tax rates in the countries that currently have net wealth taxes. The results show that net wealth taxes significantly raise the tax burden on capital income. In contrast to Norway and Switzerland, Spain’s combination of personal capital income taxes and net wealth taxes results in very high METRs, above 100 percent. This means that the entire real return is taxed away and, by saving, people would see the real value of their wealth shrunk.\nWealth Taxes Disincentivize Entrepreneurship and Incentivize Risk-taking\nOne of the arguments in favor of a wealth tax is that on top of capital income taxes, it could encourage taxpayers to use assets more productively. For example, if a household owns land that is not being used, no income is generated and no income tax is being paid. However, if a wealth tax is levied, the household will have an incentive to make a more productive use of the land or to sell it to someone who will.[11]\nA 2017 paper suggests that replacing capital income taxes with a wealth tax shifts the tax burden onto unproductive entrepreneurs and that this reallocation increases productivity and output.[12] Efficiency gains can occur because capital is reallocated to high-return individuals, and because the higher yield of high-return individuals can motivate the accumulation of greater savings.[13] Wealth taxes do not discourage investment in general, but they do discourage investments in low-return assets and strengthen the incentives to invest in higher-return assets or consume one’s wealth because there is an additional cost to holding assets, which is not linked to the return they generate.\nNevertheless, an OECD report argues that these taxes can discourage risk-taking and entrepreneurship, harming innovation and impacting long-term growth.[14] However, it also suggests that, in some cases, a net wealth tax could spur investment and risk-taking (particularly if it replaces an income tax). Since the wealth tax would erode the after-tax return for an entrepreneur, that entrepreneur might engage in even riskier ventures to maximize a potential return. However, a wealth tax would be a particularly poor way to encourage risk-taking because wealthy individuals could choose to increase their consumption to reduce their wealth.\nA 2020 Tax Foundation analysis found that a potential wealth tax in the U.S. would reduce economic output and shrink national income owned by Americans. A wealth tax would induce foreign inflows of hundreds of billions of dollars a year to replace reductions in U.S. savings, which would cause international investors to replace home-grown billionaires as owners of capital.[15]\nAnother recently published paper describes a different mechanism through which wealth taxes affect corporate financial policies.[16] The study finds that a significant increase in dividend payouts occurs when a substantial increase in stock prices is paired with the existence of individual wealth taxes. This pattern is more pronounced in closely held companies. As the value of a company rises to the point of substantially increasing the wealth tax of controlling shareholders, these shareholders can induce companies to make a dividend payout. Additionally, these larger dividend payouts are associated with lower levels of subsequent investment.\nWealth Taxes Reduce Employment, Wages, Investment and Output\nAnother argument in favor of the wealth tax is that it is a well-targeted means of reducing inequality. In his book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Thomas Piketty considers that wealth taxes would be able to take from the very rich without supposedly hurting the poor or middle class. His initial proposal of a wealth tax involves applying a 1 percent rate for net assets between EUR 1 million and EUR 5 million, and a 2 percent rate for assets above EUR 5 million. Although this plan includes a tax exemptionA tax exemption excludes certain income, revenue, or even taxpayers from tax altogether. For example, nonprofits that fulfill certain requirements are granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), preventing them from having to pay income tax. for the first EUR 1 million, he also considers it effective to introduce an additional 0.5 percent rate for net assets between EUR 0.2 million and EUR 1 million.\nTable 3. Piketty's Wealth Tax Proposal\n| Net Wealth (Euros) | Rate |\n|---|---|\n| 0 - 200,000 | 0% |\n| 200,000 - 1,000,000 | 0.5% |\n| 1,000,000 - 5,000,000 | 1% |\n| 5,000,000 and above | 2% |\nA Tax Foundation analysis from 2014 found that the effect of a potential version of Piketty’s wealth tax on the U.S. economy, even with a EUR 200,000 exemption, would be devastating. Over a 10-year period, wages would be 5.2 percent lower, 1.12 million jobs would be lost, the capital stock would be 16.5 percent lower than otherwise, and the overall economy would have 6.1 percent less output than the status quo, resulting in a loss of USD 1 trillion (EUR 0.92 trillion). Additionally, the revenue generated by the new tax, accounting for the GDP decline, would amount to only USD 63 billion (EUR 58 billion).\nTable 4. The Impact of Piketty’s Wealth Tax Proposal on the U.S. Economy\n| Percentage Change | |\n|---|---|\n| GDP | -6.08% |\n| Capital Stock | -16.48% |\n| Jobs | -1.16% |\n| Wages | -5.2% |\nEven though it is theoretically a tax only for the rich, all social classes, including the poorest, would be affected by the wealth tax due to the reduction in economic activity. In monetary terms, people in the highest income percentiles would see their after-tax incomes reduced by between 11 percent and 13 percent. Similarly, those in the lower percentiles (between the 40th and 60th) would also see their incomes fall by 8 percent. This supposed reduction in inequality between the rich and the poor is achieved at the cost of both groups seeing their incomes diminished, although some more than others. Is it worth reducing the incomes of the middle class by 7 percent so that the rich (the top 1 percent) see their incomes reduced by 13 percent?\nNo matter what, households at the bottom of the wealth distribution and middle-income households would be most affected by the drop in employment (1.16 percent), lower wages (5.2 percent), and the reduction in the supply of goods and services.\nA wealth tax can reduce income and wealth inequality but at the cost of making everyone poorer.\nSpain’s experience of enacting a similar wealth tax to the one proposed by Piketty corroborates the idea that wealth taxes are not an effective tool to redistribute wealth and narrow wealth inequality.\nCollect Little Revenue\nWealth taxes have generally accounted for a very small share of tax revenues. In 2022, tax revenues from individual net wealth taxes ranged from 0.19 percent of GDP in Spain to 1.19 percent of GDP in Switzerland. As a share of total tax revenues, they ranged from 0.51 percent in Spain to 4.35 percent in Switzerland.\nLonger-term trends show Switzerland has always been an exception, with tax revenues from net wealth taxes consistently higher than other countries. Figure 5 compares net wealth tax revenues as a share of GDP in different years from 1980 to 2022. Tax revenue trends show that revenues remained stable or declined over time.\nThe only exception is Switzerland, where tax revenues increased over time. Historically, Switzerland has collected considerably higher revenues from its wealth taxes than other countries.\nIn Norway, despite relatively higher tax rates compared to Switzerland and a low exemption threshold, revenues appear to be low. But Norway is still raising twice as much revenue as a fraction of GDP than Spain does, while Spain’s top tax rate triples Norway’s tax rate.\nWith lower tax rates, Switzerland is collecting three times as much revenue as any other country. This could be explained by low exemption thresholds, a broader tax baseThe tax base is the total amount of income, property, assets, consumption, transactions, or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority. A narrow tax base is non-neutral and inefficient. A broad tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates., and a higher share of wealthy individuals in the country. Additionally, since 2013, Switzerland has experienced a steep increase in revenues collected from individual net wealth taxes as a share of GDP, from 0.88 percent of GDP in 2013 to 1.19 percent of GDP in 2022. This increase could be explained by an increase in the number of wealthy individuals in Switzerland, who prefer the country for its greater stability over other more volatile countries and regions in the world.[17]\nDifferences in individual net wealth tax revenues across countries reflect a variety of factors, including the design of the tax, taxpayers’ possibilities and propensity to avoid and evade taxes, the distribution of wealth in the country, and the effects of other countries’ tax policies, which may contribute to the erosion of domestic tax revenues through capital flight.\nPeople Vote with Their Feet\nOne of the reasons Sweden abolished its wealth tax was because capital and high-net-worth individuals fled the country. It was argued that the special treatment of business equity made the wealth tax regressive—taxing middle-class wealth and exempting the wealthiest individuals’ assets (closely held firms)—and it was responsible for spurring tax avoidance, including capital flight to tax havens.[18]\nIn Norway, after a 1 percent increase in the wealth tax, the government decided to approve a higher exit tax as billionaires fled the country.[19] Currently, due to the exodus of high-net-worth individuals to countries like Switzerland, Sweden’s largest banks are opening new offices in Zurich.[20]\nIn 2023, after the Spanish solidarity wealth tax was declared constitutional, Portugal decided to extend its tax regime for nonresidents since more Spanish taxpayers were considering changing their tax residence.[21]\nIn the United States, Washington State has recently advanced a wealth tax proposal of a one percent tax on tradable net worth above $250 million. While the state’s economists projected that the wealth tax would raise about $3.2 billion a year, $1.44 billion, almost 45 percent, would have been collected from Jeff Bezos. But his decision to move to Florida just eliminated potential wealth tax collections worth nearly half the official estimate.[22]\nWhen a tax is so heavily concentrated on a few wealthy, highly mobile individuals, that’s what happens when just one person moves.\nIn other countries like Switzerland, taxpayers need to approve any tax increases. In 2023, voters in Geneva rejected an extra “solidarity” levy on individuals with more than CHF 3 million (EUR 1.04 million or USD 3.4 million) in assets. Even the local government spoke out against the increase.[23]\nFive Decades of the Wealth Tax in Spain\nFrom a Temporary Measure to a Permanent Tax\nIn 1977, the Law of Urgent Measures for Tax Reform introduced a tax on households’ net wealth for the first time in Spain. The aim of this “exceptional and temporary” tax was to create an asset registry of the wealth held by Spanish residents and to monitor possible income concealments through changes in asset composition. However, this reasoning mistakenly assumed that those who evade income taxes would declare the eluded amount in their wealth tax declaration.\nLater on, with the Wealth Tax Law 19 of 1991, the principles of a “temporary and exceptional” wealth tax were abandoned, and the tax was completely integrated into the Spanish tax system. This new law acknowledged that the primary purpose of the wealth tax had been to create an asset registry and control the truthfulness of taxpayers’ income tax declarations. The new law reasoned the reintroduction of the wealth tax as a means to:\n- Increase equity by taxing the greater payment capacity that asset ownership entails\n- Encourage a more productive use of assets\n- Redistribute income and wealth\n- Complement the personal income tax (IRPF) and the inheritance and gift taxA gift tax is a tax on the transfer of property by a living individual, without payment or a valuable exchange in return. The donor, not the recipient of the gift, is typically liable for the tax.\nThe wealth tax is borne by Spanish residents on their worldwide wealth and non-residents on their Spanish-based assets. The 1991 reform raised the exemption threshold and increased the progressivity of the wealth tax, increasing the top rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent. In 1994, assets used by entrepreneurs for their business activity became exempt. Since 1997, the tax benefit has been extended to publicly traded companies, making business assets fully exempt. Between 1982 (Catalonia) and 2002 (Madrid), the authority to levy the tax was transferred to the regional governments. Furthermore, since 1997, the regional governments have been given fiscal legislative power to modify the tax bracketsA tax bracket is the range of incomes taxed at given rates, which typically differ depending on filing status. In a progressive individual or corporate income tax system, rates rise as income increases. There are seven federal individual income tax brackets; the federal corporate income tax system is flat., tax rates, exemption thresholds, deductions, and tax credits, although within certain limits. In 2000, an exemption was established for the main residence up to a certain limit.\nIn 2001, the reform of the regional financing system gave full sovereignty to the regions to legislate the wealth tax without restrictions. Navarra and Basque Country also have full power to regulate and apply the tax within their territorial scope.\nBy 2008, the tax hadn’t achieved its objectives, and changes in international tax policy motivated Spain’s central government to abolish the tax by offering 100 percent relief.\nHowever, three years later, in September 2011, due to the prolonged economic crisis that Spain was going through and the need to raise more revenue, the wealth tax was temporarily restored for 2011 (retroactively) and 2012. At the end of 2012, the tax was extended to the 2013 fiscal year. However, over the following years, the state budgets extended the tax for each fiscal year. Nonetheless, 13 years later, the tax remains in effect. Additionally, the 2021 state budget law repealed the 2008 tax relief to avoid the need to restore the tax year after year.\nA Second “Temporary” Wealth Tax\nAt the end of 2022, the Spanish central government introduced a new, temporary “solidarity wealth tax” in 2022 and 2023 (to be collected in 2023 and 2024) ranging from 1.7 percent to 3.5 percent on individuals with net assets exceeding EUR 3 million (USD 3.23 million). In practice, the state tax only affects taxpayers in autonomous communities with a common tax regime (all Spanish regions except Navarra, and the three provinces in the Basque Country) that apply a lower tax rate than the state rate. Under this new tax scheme, the central government collects any additional revenue from the solidarity tax once the regional wealth tax collection is deducted. Consequently, Madrid, Extremadura, and Andalusia restored the wealth tax so that the regional governments retain the revenues the central government plans to collect in 2024. Additionally, three other regions raised the exemption threshold to EUR 3 million (Balearic Island and Cantabria) and EUR 3.7 million (Murcia) to equal the tax relief offered by Andalusia, Extremadura, and Madrid.\nIn the case of Navarre and the Basque Country, both regions have full sovereignty to legislate and apply the tax within their territorial scope. Nonetheless, Navarra raised the top tax rate to 3.5 percent to harmonize it with the new solidarity wealth tax.\nUnexpected Consequences of a Bad Tax Policy\nWith this solidarity tax, the central government expected to collect over EUR 1.5 billion in 2023 (fiscal year 2022), but in the end, it only collected 40 percent of that amount: EUR 0.6 billion.[24]\nNot only did the solidarity tax not collect the revenue announced, but the three regional governments of Madrid, Andalusia, and Galicia also appealed the “solidarity wealth tax” to the Constitutional Court. However, after the Constitutional Court ruled that the solidarity wealth tax is constitutional, Andalusia, Extremadura, and Madrid restored the wealth tax so that the regional governments retain the revenues the central government plans to collect in 2024.\nAdditionally, three other regions raised the exception threshold to EUR 3 million (Balearic Island and Cantabria) and EUR 3.7 million (Murcia) to equal the tax relief offered by Andalusia, Extremadura, and Madrid. In the end, each region used a different tax mechanism to counterbalance the state wealth tax, adding an unnecessary burden on taxpayers and regional tax legislators.\nSpanish legal tax experts argue that the reform might be unconstitutional since it violates the principle of legal certainty and operates retroactively (to the year 2022, instead of 2023 as initially announced). It might also violate the EU legal order.[25]\nHowever, this was not the initial plan of the Spanish central government. Previously, the Spanish government named an external tax reform committee to review environmental taxation, corporate tax, taxation of the digital economy, and harmonization of regional tax policies. The committee released a list of 118 tax reform measures, most of which consisted of tax hikes.[26]\nThe Spanish tax reform committee also made recommendations on how to harmonize wealth taxes among regions, especially in response to the wealth tax relief in Madrid. The experts recommended a minimum threshold and the maintenance of regulatory powers upwards and downwards for both the tax rate and threshold within a certain range (to be determined). The experts recommended increasing the wealth tax threshold from the current EUR 700,000 (USD 752,783) to EUR 1 million (USD 1.07 million). The experts also recommended reducing the progressive tax rates ranging from 0.20 to 3.5 percent to rates ranging from 0.5 to 1 percent, in line with what other countries currently apply (see Norway and Switzerland).\nContrary to the recommendations of the reform committee, the government chose to maintain the 3.5 confiscatory top tax rate and harmonize the rate across regions. As seen in the previous chapter, the wealth tax in Spain was already confiscatory at a 2.5 percent rate. This tax hike will shrink Spain’s wealth at an unprecedented speed.\nMeanwhile, Portugal’s decision to extend its tax regime for non-residents for one more year was timely, since more Spanish taxpayers were considering changing their tax residence.[27]\nConclusion\nWealth taxes generate double or even triple taxation. In the case of Spain, the combination of personal capital income taxes and net wealth taxes results in marginal tax rates well above 100 percent. This means that the entire real return is taxed away and, by saving, people would see the real value of their wealth shrunk. Spain is the only country in the world that, in addition to net wealth taxes and capital gains, also levies taxes on capital transfers, a financial transaction tax, and one of the highest inheritance and gift taxes in Europe. This translates into a quadruple or quintuple taxation. Policymakers should work to redesign Spain’s fiscal policy by eliminating double and quadruple taxation following Tax Foundation’s principles for a sound tax policy.[28]\nThe recent tax policy developments in Spain have already generated legal problems and forced taxpayers, small investors, and companies to relocate to countries with more reliable and stable tax policy. [29] Taxpayers fleeing the country are not only taking the wealth tax revenue with them but also the income and consumption taxA consumption tax is typically levied on the purchase of goods or services and is paid directly or indirectly by the consumer in the form of retail sales taxes, excise taxes, tariffs, value-added taxes (VAT), or income taxes where all savings are tax-deductible. revenue, which are the most important sources of revenue for European countries and Spain.\nWealth taxes have always collected little revenue. Only in Switzerland—the only country in the world with a low tax rate, broad base, and a large number of billionaires—do tax revenues from individual net wealth taxes reach one percent of GDP. Additionally, wealth taxes are a poor and ineffective way to reduce wealth gaps, not only due to their low revenues but also because a solid redistribution mechanism would need to be in place, and that would create new impacts on its own. Also, if the tax base for these policies were to be broadened, it would make households further down the wealth distribution worse off.\nAs tempting as wealth taxes might look, especially when so many international organizations note them as a way to reduce wealth inequality, their limited capacity to collect revenue and their negative impact on entrepreneurial activity, savings, innovation, and long-term growth should make policymakers consider their repeal instead of boosting them.\nAt the EU or global level, a coordinated wealth tax, like the 15 percent global corporate minimum tax, is highly improbable. Instead of a Pillar Two approach, a worldwide wealth tax would need an approach more like Pillar One, where a critical number of countries must sign the agreement, including China, Switzerland, and the United States. In Switzerland, taxpayers need to approve any tax increases, making this proposal unfeasible.[30] Another flaw in this approach is the fact that wealth can move beyond borders to any country that is unwilling to sign the agreement.\nInstead, policymakers should focus on policies that do not undermine economic growth. Spain should consider full expensingFull expensing allows businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of certain investments in new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings. It alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more, which, in the long run, raises worker productivity, boosts wages, and creates more jobs. for capital investment to increase private investment and accelerate the economic recovery. The government is looking to boost its revenue and at the same time protect the poor. Because of this, policymakers should simplify value-added tax and make it more efficient and neutral by broadening the tax base, lowering the tax rate, and eliminating unnecessary tax exemptions. The government can then implement compensation measures for poorer households, such as targeted tax credits or direct transfers to low-income earners.\nPolicymakers should shy away from unnecessary tax hikes and harmonization measures and implement tax reforms that could eventually accelerate economic growth.\nStay informed on the tax policies impacting you.\nSubscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox.\nSubscribe[1] James Munson, “UN Draft Tax Treaty Urges Fairer Taxing Rights, Wealth Taxes,” Bloomberg Tax, Jun. 7, 2024, https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/un-draft-tax-treaty-calls-for-fairer-taxing-rights-wealth-taxes; Annette Alstadsæter, Sarah Godar, Panayiotis Nicolaides, and Gabriel Zucman, “Global Tax Evasion Report 2024,”, EU Tax Observatory, 2023, https://www.taxobservatory.eu/publication/global-tax-evasion-report-2024/; Cristina Enache, “The Wealth Tax Discussion Is Back,” Tax Foundation, Jul. 6, 2023, https://taxfoundation.org/blog/eu-wealth-tax-discussion/; Richard Partington, “A historic step’: G20 discusses plans for global minimum tax on billionaires,” The Guardian, Feb. 29, 2024, https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/feb/29/taxation-worlds-billionaires-super-rich-g20-brazil and https://x.com/gabriel_zucman/status/1800896953133469824\n[2] Impuesto Temporal de Solidaridad de las Grandes Fortunas (ITSGF) in Spanish.\n[3] Daniel Bunn, “What the U.S. Can Learn from the Adoption (and Repeal) of Wealth Taxes in the OECD,” Tax Foundation, Jan. 18, 2022, https://taxfoundation.org/blog/wealth-taxes-in-the-oecd/.\n[4] Cristina Enache, “Wealth Taxes in Europe, 2024,” Feb. 27, 2024, https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/wealth-taxes-europe-2024/.\n[5] EY, “Worldwide Estate and Inheritance Tax Guide 2023,” Jul. 20, 2023, https://www.ey.com/en_gl/tax-guides/worldwide-estate-and-inheritance-tax-guide.\n[6]Rodrigo Orihuela, “Spain to Increase Tax on the Rich With $2.9 Million in Assets,” Bloomberg News, Sep. 29, 2022, https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-international/spain-to-increase-tax-on-the-rich-with-2-9-million-in-assets.\n[7] NL Times, “New policy for taxing wealth in box 3 still discriminating, Supreme Court rules,” Jun. 6, 2024, https://nltimes.nl/2024/06/06/new-policy-taxing-wealth-box-3-still-discriminating-supreme-court-rules.\n[8] Cristina Enache, “Spain Is Doubling Down on Poor Tax Policy,” Tax Foundation, Apr. 10, 2023, https://taxfoundation.org/blog/spain-wealth-tax-windfall-tax/.\n[9] Spanish Constitutional Court, “El pleno del Tribunal Constitucional desestima el recurso de inconstitucionalidad interpuesto por el gobierno de la Comunidad de Madrid contra el impuesto sobre grandes fortunas,” Nov. 7, 2023, https://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/NotasDePrensaDocumentos/NP_2023_092/NOTA%20INFORMATIVA%20N%C2%BA%2092-2023.pdf; Eva Martin Diaz and Joaquin Huelin, “Constitucionalidad del Impuesto Temporal de las Grandes Fortunas,” Cuatrecasas, Dec. 1, 2023, https://www.cuatrecasas.com/es/spain/fiscalidad/art/itsgf-impuesto-grandes-fortunas-constitucional.\n[10] Alex Mengden, “Capital Gains Tax Rates in Europe, 2024,” Tax Foundation, Mar. 12, 2024, https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/capital-gains-tax-rates-in-europe-2024/; Marie Borst and Cristina Enache, “Estate, Inheritance, and Gift Taxes in Europe, 2024,” Tax Foundation, Apr. 23, 2024, https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/estate-taxes-inheritance-taxes-gift-taxes-europe-2024/.\n[11] T.

Before they officially set out on the next chapter of their journeys, we caught up to get some reflections from their time in the program.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        FACT SHEET: United States Support for Global Efforts to Combat Carbon Pollution and Build Resilience\nToday, President Obama is announcing the intention of the United States to contribute $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), reflecting the U.S. commitment to reduce carbon pollution and strengthen resilience in developing countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. The United States joins other nations that have already pledged financial support to this vital new global effort, including Mexico, Korea, Germany, France, Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland. Additional countries are expected to pledge soon.\nBy financing investments that help countries reduce carbon pollution and strengthen resilience to climate change, the GCF will help leverage public and private finance to avoid some of the most catastrophic risks of climate change. By reducing those risks, the GCF will help promote smart, sustainable long-term economic growth and preserve stability and security in fragile regions of strategic importance to the United States.\nThe U.S. contribution to the GCF builds on a history of U.S. leadership to support climate action. In 2008, the Bush Administration pledged $2 billion to the Climate Investment Funds, which were established as a transitional measure to finance efforts to help developing countries address climate change. The U.S. pledge to the GCF demonstrates a continuation of the bipartisan resolve to help developing nations reduce their own emissions, whose dangerous impacts on the climate affect us all, as well as to help the most vulnerable cope with the impacts of climate change. The GCF will also help spur global markets in clean energy technologies, creating opportunities for U.S. entrepreneurs and manufacturers who are leading the way to a low-carbon future.\nThe GCF was originally called for in 2009 in the Copenhagen Accord, in which developing countries first committed to taking action to mitigate their carbon emissions, including by laying out specific goals and targets. The GCF will employ world-class safeguards and will finance projects and programs with the greatest potential to reduce harmful pollution and foster adaptation to climate impacts. Although the political impetus to establish the GCF came from the multilateral climate negotiations, the GCF is an independent legal entity that makes independent funding and operational decisions. It is not a United Nations agency or entity, nor will it have a large bureaucracy.\nThe United States intends to contribute $3 billion to this initial fund raising effort, not to exceed 30 percent of total confirmed pledges. This share is consistent with the U.S. contribution to other funds in which we have exercised U.S. leadership to catalyze other contributions. We expect that the U.S. share will decline over time as the range of countries contributing to the GCF expands. While the United States is committed to supporting a wide range of mitigation and adaptation programs in developing countries through the GCF, we will target a significant portion of our GCF support to the GCF’s Private Sector Facility. This is in recognition of the essential role the GCF must play in mobilizing private sector financing to scale up low-emission and climate-resilient investment in developing countries.\nThe United States expects that the GCF will become a preeminent, effective, and efficient channel for climate finance and is working to finalize the GCF’s governance and institutional policies in 2015. In this regard, the United States reserves the ability to direct a portion of this pledge to other multilateral climate funds to the extent necessary based on the pace of progress.\nSome of the innovative features of the GCF include:\n- A dedicated Private Sector Facility. Unlike most climate funds, the GCF will have a dedicated Private Sector Facility to support entrepreneurs developing low-carbon and climate resilient projects. It will also mobilize capital from private investors around the world. The Board is also advised by a standing Private Sector Advisory Group, composed of business leaders from developed and developing countries.\n- Inclusive governance and wider donor base. The GCF’s governance structure—headed by a 24-member Board with an equal number of developed and developing countries—gives it a uniquely high level of international buy-in and collaboration, with a corresponding ability to attract non-traditional donors.\n- World-class safeguards and accountability mechanisms. The GCF will require among the strongest fiduciary standards and social and environmental safeguards for all multilateral funds in climate finance today. This will help promote GCF-financed projects and programs that are responsibly designed and implemented, and that all financial resources are managed prudently and transparently. Moreover, the GCF has an Independent Evaluation Unit, which evaluates the impact of GCF programs and projects, as well as an Independent Integrity Unit, which investigates allegations of wrongdoing or prohibited practices. Both units will report to the Board, not the Secretariat. The Board itself makes independent funding and operational decisions.\n- Work in both mitigation and adaptation. The GCF will balance its support for emissions mitigation and climate adaptation and resilience activities, building up expertise in both areas and positioning itself to capitalize on synergies between them. This balance will make the GCF unique compared with other funds.\n- Global reach. The GCF will work through a larger network of public and private partners than most other climate funds.

On the occasion of President Xi’s State Visit to Washington, D.C., the two Presidents reaffirm their shared conviction that climate change is one of the greatest threats facing humanity and that their two countries have a critical role to play in addressing it. The two Presidents also reaffirm their determination to move ahead decisively to implement domestic climate policies, to strengthen bilateral coordination and cooperation, and to promote sustainable development and the transition to green, low-carbon, and climate-resilient economies.\nVision for the Paris Climate Conference:\n- The two Presidents reaffirm the U.S.-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change of November 12, 2014. Recalling the Durban mandate to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties, they strengthen their resolve to work together and with others toward an ambitious, successful Paris outcome that furthers the implementation of the objective of the Convention, mindful of the below 2 degree C global temperature goal.\n- They reaffirm their commitment to reach an ambitious agreement in 2015 that reflects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances. They further consider that differentiation should be reflected in relevant elements of the agreement in an appropriate manner.\n- Both sides support the inclusion in the Paris outcome of an enhanced transparency system to build mutual trust and confidence and promote effective implementation including through reporting and review of action and support in an appropriate manner. It should provide flexibility to those developing countries that need it in light of their capacities.\n- The United States and China welcome the enhanced actions reflected in the intended nationally determined contributions communicated by each other and by other Parties.\n- The two sides recognize that Parties’ mitigation efforts are crucial steps in a longer-range effort needed to transition to green and low-carbon economies and they should move in the direction of greater ambition over time. Further, the United States and China underscore the importance of formulating and making available mid-century strategies for the transition to low-carbon economies, mindful of the below 2 degree C global temperature goal. Both sides also emphasize the need for global low-carbon transformation during the course of this century.\n- Both sides stress the importance of adaptation. The Paris agreement should accord greater prominence and visibility to adaptation, including by recognizing that it is a key component of the long-term global response to climate change, in terms of both preparing for the unavoidable impacts of climate change and enhancing resilience. The agreement should encourage Parties to work at both the national and international levels to build resilience and reduce vulnerability. It should provide for regular, high-level focus on adaptation.\n- The two sides reaffirm that, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, developed countries committed to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries and that this funding would come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance. They underscore the importance of continued, robust financial support beyond 2020 to help developing countries build low-carbon and climate-resilient societies. They urge continued support by developed countries to developing countries and encourage such support by other countries willing to do so.\n- The two sides also recognize the crucial role of major technological advancement in the transition to green and low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable development and affirm the importance of significant increases in basic research and development in the coming years both within their own economies and globally.\nAdvancing Domestic Climate Action:\n- The United States and China are committed to achieving their respective post-2020 actions as announced in last November’s Joint Announcement. Since that time, both countries have taken key steps toward implementation and are committing to continue intensifying efforts, which will substantially promote global investment in low-carbon technologies and solutions.\n- Since last November’s Joint Announcement, the United States has taken major steps to reduce its emissions, and it is announcing important additional implementation plans today. In August 2015, the United States finalized the Clean Power Plan, which will reduce CO2 emissions from the power sector to 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. In 2016, the United States will finalize a federal plan to implement carbon emission standards for power plants in states that do not choose to design their own implementation plans under the Clean Power Plan. The United States commits to finalize its next-stage, world-class fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles in 2016 and implement them in 2019. In August 2015, the United States proposed separate standards for methane emissions from landfills and the oil and gas sector, and commits to finalize both standards in 2016. In July 2015, the United States finalized significant new measures to reduce use and emissions of HFCs through the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program, and commits today to continue to pursue new actions in 2016 to reduce HFC use and emissions. Finally, in the buildings sector, the United States commits to finalize over 20 efficiency standards for appliances and equipment by the end of 2016.\n- China is making great efforts to advance ecological civilization and promote green, low-carbon, climate resilient and sustainable development through accelerating institutional innovation and enhancing policies and actions. China will lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60% to 65% from the 2005 level by 2030 and increase the forest stock volume by around 4.5 billion cubic meters on the 2005 level by 2030. China will promote green power dispatch, giving priority, in distribution and dispatching, to renewable power generation and fossil fuel power generation of higher efficiency and lower emission levels. China also plans to start in 2017 its national emission trading system, covering key industry sectors such as iron and steel, power generation, chemicals, building materials, paper-making, and nonferrous metals. China commits to promote low-carbon buildings and transportation, with the share of green buildings reaching 50% in newly built buildings in cities and towns by 2020 and the share of public transport in motorized travel reaching 30% in big- and medium-sized cities by 2020. It will finalize next-stage fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles in 2016 and implement them in 2019. Actions on HFCs continue to be supported and accelerated, including effectively controlling HFC-23 emissions by 2020.\nEnhancing Bilateral and Multilateral Climate Cooperation:\n- Building on the robust bilateral cooperation initiatives that support the achievement of ambitious domestic actions, the two sides commit to further deepen and enhance these efforts through the U.S.-China Climate Change Working Group (CCWG), the premier mechanism for facilitating constructive U.S.-China dialogue and cooperation on climate change. The two sides have made concrete progress in each of the initiatives, including heavy-duty and other vehicles, smart grids, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), energy efficiency in buildings and industry, collecting and managing greenhouse gas emissions data, climate change and forests, industrial boilers efficiency and fuel switching, and climate-smart/low-carbon cities, and will continue to work together on green ports and vessels and zero emission vehicles, as well as the enhanced policy dialogue and cooperation on HFCs. Furthermore, a new Domestic Policy Dialogue was established this year to share information on respective domestic actions. The two sides will continue to devote significant effort and resources to the existing initiatives. On the CCUS project agreed to in the 2014 Joint Announcement, the two countries have identified the project site in Yan’an-Yulin, Shan’xi Province, China, operated by Shan’xi Yanchang Petroleum. The two sides will continue to collaborate to demonstrate the utilization of CO2 for enhanced water recovery.\n- The United States and China recognize and appreciate the critical role of cities, states and provinces in addressing climate change, supporting the implementation of national actions and accelerating the long-term transition to a low carbon and livable society. The Presidents welcome the outcome of the First Session of the U.S.-China Climate-Smart/Low-Carbon Cities Summit, held in Los Angeles on September 15-16, 2015, and look forward to a successful Second Session to be held in Beijing in 2016. The Presidents support the U.S.-China Climate Leaders Declaration, signed by 24 provinces, states, cities, and counties of the United States and China, as well as the climate actions listed in the Declaration, including an initiative by provinces and cities in China for peaking pioneers and the medium and long-term greenhouse gas reduction targets of states, counties and cities in the United States. The United States and China also emphasize that businesses can play an important role in promoting low-carbon development, and will make continued efforts to encourage and incentivize actions by businesses.\n- The United States and China recognize the importance of mobilizing climate finance to support low-carbon, climate-resilient development in developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, small island developing states, and African countries. In this connection, the United States reaffirms its $3 billion pledge to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and China announces that it will make available ¥20 billion for setting up the China South-South Climate Cooperation Fund to support other developing countries to combat climate change, including to enhance their capacity to access GCF funds. Going forward and through these steps and other actions, the two sides are determined to work constructively and cooperatively together and along with all Parties to the UNFCCC to support developing countries to transition to green and low-carbon development and build climate resilience.\n- The United States and China consider that their bilateral investments in other countries should support low-carbon technologies and climate resilience and commit to discussing the role of public finance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Both countries are to use public resources to finance and encourage the transition toward low-carbon technologies as a priority. As part of an ongoing and serious commitment to strengthen low-carbon policies and regulations, the United States has ended public financing for new conventional coal-fired power plants except in the poorest countries. China will strengthen green and low-carbon policies and regulations with a view to strictly controlling public investment flowing into projects with high pollution and carbon emissions both domestically and internationally.\n- The United States and China will strengthen their dialogue and cooperation to advance climate change related issues in relevant fora complementary to the UNFCCC, such as the G-20, Montreal Protocol, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Maritime Organization, World Trade Organization and Clean Energy Ministerial.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Is that true?\nFormer President Donald Trump raged against Vice President Kamala Harris on his social media platform Truth Social for saying he wanted to end the Affordable Care Act, the federal law signed by then-President Barack Obama that expanded access to health insurance.\n“Lyin’ Kamala is giving a News Conference now, saying that I want to end the Affordable Care Act,” Trump posted on October 31, which was also shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. “I never mentioned doing that, never even thought about such a thing.”\nLyin’ Kamala is giving a News Conference now, saying that I want to end the Affordable Care Act. I never mentioned doing that, never even thought about such a thing. She also said I want to end Social Security. Likewise, never mentioned it, or thought of it. She is the one that…\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2024\nTrump has given mixed and incomplete information about his plan for the 2010 law during the current campaign; and Democrats, including Harris, have exaggerated how certain it is that Trump will do away with the law if he wins back the Oval Office. His campaign says he does not want to repeal it any more.\nBut it is ridiculously wrong for Trump to say he has never even mentioned getting rid of it. In his first campaign and as president, Trump supported the idea of getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.\nTrump’s new claim fits into another moment of the campaign’s revisionist health history; his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, falsely said in September that Trump “chose to build upon” the Affordable Care Act.\nTrump’s history with the Affordable Care Act\nDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, the Republican promised to repeal the law, sometimes called Obamacare. Shortly after taking office, Trump discussed his “ambitious legislative agenda”, which included eliminating the Affordable Care Act. He called it “a disaster” and said he wanted to save families from what he described as a “catastrophic rise in premiums and debilitating loss of choice and just about everything else”.\nTrump supported congressional Republicans’ failed repeal-and-replace efforts. One example is the American Health Care Act, a bill to repeal the law’s subsidies and regulations, that the House passed in May 2017; it failed in the Senate. In June 2020, Trump’s administration asked the US Supreme Court to block the law, but the court dismissed the case.\nTrump also cut funding for the law’s marketing, outreach and enrolment assistance. He expanded access to short-term, limited-coverage plans that Democrats call “junk insurance”, arguing they limit care and can lead to surprise medical bills.\nDuring Trump’s presidency, Affordable Care Act enrolment declined by more than two million and the number of uninsured Americans rose by 2.3 million.\nWhat is Trump’s plan now?\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump has said inconsistent things about whether he wants to overturn the law. In late 2023, he expressed interest in repealing and replacing the law.\n“The cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it’s not good Healthcare. I’m seriously looking at alternatives,” Trump wrote on November 25, 2023, on Truth Social. “We had a couple of Republican Senators who campaigned for 6 years against it, and then raised their hands not to terminate it. It was a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!”\nOn November 29, 2023, he wrote, “I don’t want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!”\nSince then, he has backtracked.\nIn March this year, he wrote on Truth Social that he is “not running to terminate” the healthcare law, but wants to make it “better” and “less expensive”.\nHe said during the September 10 debate with Harris that he has “concepts of a plan” to replace it.\nBut he has not given more details, the Republican Party platform does not address the Affordable Care Act, and he has not mentioned the law in his campaign promises.\nIn a statement for this article, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Repealing Obamacare is not President Trump’s policy position. As President Trump has said, he will make our health care system better by increasing transparency, promoting choice and competition, and expanding access to new affordable healthcare and insurance options.”\nOur ruling\nTrump said, “I never mentioned” wanting to end the Affordable Care Act and have “never even thought about such a thing.”\nWe cannot read his mind, but we heard his words. And Trump as a candidate in 2016 and as president not only entertained and discussed that idea but sought to end the law through congressional action and at the Supreme Court.\nHe has said inconsistent things about his plan for the law if he wins the presidency — and his latest position is that a repeal is off the table. But it is inaccurate and ridiculous to say he has never “mentioned” wanting to scuttle the law. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        {{item.title}}\n{{item.text}}\n{{item.text}}\nPresident Trump's strategic agenda for healthcare is taking shape and setting the stage for a horizon of healthcare transformation. This transformation aims to shift the emphasis from treatment to prevention while enhancing personalized care and continuing to push to cut drug costs.\nLooking ahead, the Trump administration and GOP are in a position to accelerate their health agenda with four key themes:\nDonald Trump’s second term as president marks a significant shift in the political landscape, with considerable implications for the health industry. It is important to consider how the landscape has changed since President Trump’s first term. For one, the debate to repeal and replace the ACA no longer retains the level of political or public support it did in 2016 and healthcare resources and policy efforts that had been focused on the pandemic during the last term can now focus on regulatory and market reform.\nStrong momentum exists for change and disruption given Republican control of Congress, a far more prepared executive transition team and cabinet nominations with packed agendas. Yet, the new Trump administration will need to work alongside a Republican Congress with very slim majorities and less ideological consensus than in past years. This may create delays or conflict as legislation is negotiated despite early political momentum.\nOne main focus of political energy in 2025 will be in negotiating the delicate balance of legislative policy change to offset the cost of an ambitious agenda including tax proposals, energy policy, deregulation priorities, defense funding, and border security. The key to passage will be in maintaining support of both hardliners who are concerned with national debt and centrists who are more hesitant to cut popular federal programs. Major cuts to Medicaid funding, ACA subsidy programs, and drug pricing are all on the table. Continued emphasis on trade policy and tariffs is also expected and may move swiftly as these do not require Congressional action.\nOn the regulatory front, President Trump’s health agenda focuses on broad public health reform with the goal of making America healthier. These initiatives are triumphed by new appointees with perspectives that may resonate with consumers and align with patient centric ideals. This may create increased emphasis on preventive health, funding for chronic diseases, and scrutiny of manufacturers’ role in agency decision making.\nUltimately, the Trump administration is poised to fulfill campaign promises, address unfinished business from his previous administration and potentially set the trajectory of the Republican party for the future.\nUnder the Trump administration, shifts toward deregulation and a market-driven system can be expected; these will alter the landscape of healthcare policy in a manner reminiscent of his first term while also addressing contemporary conservative priorities such as the “America First” agenda. The administration is likely to prioritize deregulation, fostering competition and innovation while reinvigorating efforts to tackle fraud and abuse. By decentralizing control, the administration may seek to empower states to design and implement healthcare solutions tailored to their unique needs, thereby helping reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, and promoting localized innovation, yet potentially creating a more fragmented regulatory landscape with reduced state budgets.\nExpect big announcements and headlines that catch attention but may take time to come to fruition; organizations that utilize this time to proactively prepare with scenario planning will be better positioned to capitalize on new opportunities as they arise. However, shifts in public sentiment and focus of consumer activism may occur more rapidly as they do not need to go through cumbersome regulatory processes; consumer activism and interest in reform may illicit demands for novel change.\nAnticipate continued interest from the Trump administration in sweeping economic policy changes which could have profound impacts on health industries. These include tax reforms, tariff policies, AI deregulation, immigration reform and competition policies. These changes might influence the healthcare workforce, disrupt supply chains, and impose budget constraints on health systems.\nBy considering \"no regret\" actions, organizations can navigate shifts in the competitive landscape more effectively, positioning themselves for success regardless of how the regulatory landscape evolves.\nIn addition to broader economic policy changes, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are pursuing several initiatives that target the health sector more directly. These policy changes are expected to reshape healthcare financing, regulation, and market dynamics, influencing key industry trends. Understanding these shifts will be crucial for stakeholders navigating the evolving healthcare landscape.\nRepublican-led proposals aim to cut health program funding, with a focus on Medicaid; could shift the broader marketplace, affecting service provision, funding from federal and state sources and ACA subsidies.\nPolicies may alter coverage scope including changes to eligibility requirements and ACA subsidies. Potential for a rollback of Medicaid expansion and shifts towards risk pools and short-term less restrictive plans.\nHealth and economic policy changes are expected to reduce healthcare consumption and potentially result in higher health system operating costs.\nNominations to health agency positions have sparked scrutiny of pharma-industry interactions and the role of external advisors in agency decisions. Interest remains in reforming promotional advertising regulations.\nContinued pressures on drug pricing controls, including the potential for expanded negotiation list, and potential IP or exclusivity restrictions can impact pharma's revenue and innovation cycle planning.\nPharma and medtech companies should consider how potential tariffs and growing geopolitical tensions impact manufacturing locations and vendors.\nThe Trump administration and the GOP have outlined a series of health policy initiatives aimed at reshaping the role of government in the health industry and realigning market incentives to focus on competition and innovation.\nWhile many of the public health reform policies and those focused on deregulation may be promulgated through the executive branch, it will take Congressional action to implement fiscal policies. Given the large impact proposed cuts may have on the health sector, it is advantageous to conduct scenario planning as details of potential reforms emerge. Wish lists are being released as factions of the GOP negotiate what to include in a possible reconciliation package. These lists provide insight on GOP priorities for potential spending cuts, tax changes, and other fiscal measures aimed at reducing the federal deficit and restructuring government programs. A proposal put forth by the House Ways and Means Committee, below, details proposed healthcare saving options for the period 2025–2034, with projected savings in billions of dollars.\nSavings in billions of dollars\nSource: House Budget Committee Proposal\n{{item.text}}\n{{item.text}}\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

He inherited a multibillion-dollar deficit from the preceding governor, Republican Jim Gilmore, but ended his term with a surplus.\nGilmore is now running for Senate against him.\nWarner tested the presidential waters after the single gubernatorial term permitted by Virginia law but announced in October 2006 that he didn't want to miss his daughters' last years at home.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Transcript: Mark Warner's Convention Speech\nMark Warner's Keynote Speech\nIn these prepared remarks, the former Virgina Gov. Mark Warner talks about the future of America and that electing Barack Obama president is the nation's \"one shot to get it right.\" The speech as delivered may vary from the following text.\nMy fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, the most important contest of our generation has begun. Not the campaign for the presidency, not the campaign for Congress, but the race for the future.\nAnd I believe from the bottom of my heart with the right vision, the right leadership, and the energy and creativity of the American people, there is no nation that we can't out-hustle or out-compete, and no American need be left out or left behind.\nYes, the race for the future is on, and it won't be won if only some Americans are in the running. It won't be won with yesterday's ideas and yesterday's divisions. And it won't be won with a president who is stuck in the past. We need a president who understands the world today, the future we seek and the change we need. We need Barack Obama as the next President of the United States.\nNow, I have a unique perspective on this race for the future. Like many of you, I was the first in my family to graduate from college. It was made possible by supportive parents, good public schools, and since my folks didn't have the resources, thank goodness for the student loan program. After I graduated law school, it didn't take long to realize that America really wouldn't miss me as a lawyer.\nSo I started a business. My first company failed in six weeks. My next one was much more successful. It failed in six months. And then a buddy of mine told me that there was this new idea—this thing called \"car telephones\"—\"cell phones.\"\nFriends told me, \"Warner, get a real job. No one's going to want a phone in their car.\" But I saw a different future. And with luck and a lot of hard work, I got in on the ground floor of the cell phone industry.\nThere's only one country in the world where I could have received that education. Where I could have been given not just one chance, or two, but three, and where I could have succeeded—and that's this country: the United States of America.\nAt our best, it's not your lineage or last name that matters. It's not where you come from that counts, it's where you want to go. In America, everyone should get a fair shot. Barack Obama understands this, because he's lived it. And Barack Obama is running to restore that fair shot for every American.\nWhen we look around today, we see that for too many Americans that fair shot is becoming more of a long shot. How many kids have the grades to go to college, but not the money? How many families thought their home would always be their safest investment? How many of our soldiers come back from their second or third tour of duty, wondering if the education and health care benefits they were promised will actually be there? Two wars, a warming planet, an energy policy that says let's borrow money from China to buy oil from countries that don't like us. How many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them?\nTheir children? Their country? How many? In George Bush and John McCain's America, far too many.\nLet's be fair, some of these challenges were inevitable. But all of them are more severe, more immediate and more threatening, because of the misguided policies and outdated thinking of this administration.\nPeople always ask me, \"What's my biggest criticism of President Bush?\" I'm sure you all have your own. Here's mine—it's not just the policy differences, it's the fact that this president never tapped into our greatest resource: the character and resolve of the American people. He never asked us to step up.\nThink about it: after September 11th, if there was a call from the president to get us off foreign oil to stop funding the very terrorists who had just attacked us, every American would have said, \"how can I do my part?\" This administration failed to believe in what we can achieve as a nation, when all of us work together.\nJohn McCain promises more of the same—a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids. No real strategy to invest in our crumbling infrastructure. And he would continue spending $10 billion a month in Iraq.\nI don't know about you, but that's just not right. That's four more years that we just can't afford.\nBarack Obama has a different vision—and a different plan. Right now, at this critical moment in our history, we have one shot to get it right. And the status quo just won't cut it.\nNow let me tell you, if you think there've been dramatic changes in the world and technology over the last 10 years, you ain't seen nothing yet. The race is on, and if you watched the Olympics, you know China's going for the gold.\nYou know, America has never been afraid of the future, and we shouldn't start now. If we choose the right path, every one of these challenges is also an opportunity. Look at energy: if we actually got ourselves off foreign oil, we can make our country safer. We'll start to solve global warming, and with the right policies, within 24 months, we'll be building 100 mile-per-gallon plug-in hybrid vehicles right here, with American technology and with American workers.\nLook at health care: if we bring down costs and cover everyone, not only will America be healthier, we'll be more competitive in the global economy. Just think about this: in six months we will have an administration that actually believes in science, and then we can again lead the world in life-saving and life-changing cures.\nLook at education: if we recruit an army of new teachers and actually give our schools the resources to meet our highest standards, not only will every child in America get a fair shot, the American economy will get a shot in the arm. Whether they want to be an engineer or an electrician, every kid will be trained for the jobs of the 21st century.\nOr look at America's standing in the world: if we rebuild our military and rebuild our alliances, we can rally the world to defeat terrorism and restore America's leadership. Which candidate understands these opportunities, and which candidate knows we don't have another four years to waste? Barack Obama.\nAnd Barack Obama knows this too: we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground. We need leaders who will appeal to us not as Republicans or Democrats, but first and foremost as Americans.\nYou know, I spent 20 years in business. If you ran a company whose only strategy was to tear down the competition, it wouldn't last long. So why is this wisdom so hard to find in Washington? I know we're at the Democratic convention, but if an idea works, it really doesn't matter if it has an \"R\" or a \"D\" next to it.\nBecause this election isn't about liberal vs. conservative. It's not about left vs. right. It's about the future vs. the past. In this election, at this moment, in our history, we know what the problems are. We know that at this critical juncture we have only one shot to get it right. And we know that these new times demand new thinking.\nWe believe in success. We believe that everyone should have an opportunity to get ahead, and with success comes a responsibility to make sure others can follow. I think we are blessed to be Americans. But with that blessing comes an obligation to our neighbors and our common good.\nSo you give every child the tools they need to succeed. That means quality schools, access to health care, safe neighborhoods. Not just because it's the right thing to do, of course it is; but because if those kids do better, we all do better. You can be soft-hearted or hard-headed—both are going to lead you to the same place. We're all in this together. That's what this party believes. That's what this nation believes. That's what Barack Obama and Joe Biden believe.\nAnd we can do it, sure we can. When I became governor, this is what Virginia faced: a massive budget shortfall, an economy that wasn't moving, gridlock in the capital. Sound familiar? So what did we do? Working together, a Democratic governor, with a two-to-one Republican legislature, and a whole lot of good folks who didn't see themselves as either Democrats or Republicans but as Virginians, we closed the budget gap, and Virginia was named the best managed state in the nation.\nWe made record investments in education and in job training. We got 98 percent of our eligible kids enrolled in our children's health care program. We delivered broadband to the most remote areas of our state; because, if you can send a job to Bangalore, India, you sure as heck can send one to Danville, Virginia and Flint, Michigan and Scranton, Pennsylvania and Peoria, Illinois. In a global economy, you shouldn't have to leave your home town to find a world-class job.\nLet me tell you about a place called Lebanon—Lebanon, Virginia. Lebanon is in the coalfields of southwest Virginia, and everyone in that whole town could fit right here on the convention floor. Lebanon is like many small towns in America. It has seen the industries that sustained it downsized, outsourced, or shut down. Now, some folks look at towns like Lebanon and say, \"Tough luck. In the global economy, you've lost.\"\nBut we believed that we shouldn't—and couldn't—give up on our small towns and expect the rest of the state to prosper. And that's what brought me, towards the end of my term, to the high school gym in Lebanon to announce that we were going to bring over 300 high-tech jobs, jobs that paid twice the county average.\nOne student told a reporter from The Washington Post that before this, he always thought he'd have to move away to get a good job and raise a family. I just heard from this young man, Michael Kisor. Today, he is a junior at Virginia Tech. His older brother just moved back home to Lebanon because there was an information-technology job open for him, that was just too good to pass up.\nThat's a story worth rewriting all across America. With the right leadership, we can once again achieve a standard of living that is improved—and not diminished—in each generation. We can once again make America a beacon for science and technology and discovery.\nLadies and gentlemen, we know how to do it. The American people are ready. And Barack Obama and Joe Biden will get it done.\nAs governor of Virginia, it was humbling to occupy a position that was once held by Thomas Jefferson. Almost as daunting as delivering the keynote speech four years after Barack Obama or speaking before Hillary Clinton.\nTowards the end of his life, Thomas Jefferson, the founder of our party, wrote one of his frequent letters to his old rival, John Adams. He complained about the aches of getting old, but what was on his mind was what life would be like for the next generation of Americans. As Jefferson was ready to go to sleep, he closed his letter by writing, \"I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.\"\nJefferson got it right at the dawn of the 19th century, and it's our challenge to get it right at the dawn of the 21st. This race is all about the future. That's why we must elect Barack Obama as our next president. Because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas, when we put solutions over stalemates, and when hope replaces fear.\nTonight, looking out at all of you and with a deep faith in the character and resolve of the American people, I am more confident than ever that we will win that race and make the future ours.\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\nSource: The Democratic National Convention's Official Web site.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 ushered in many new requirements for the federal regulation of private health coverage, another federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), has for over 50 years regulated the most predominant form of health coverage for people under age 65, employer-sponsored coverage.\nStates have traditionally been the primary regulators of health insurance, and state health insurance protections continue to play a major role alongside a growing list of federal protections aimed at addressing a variety of consumer concerns, including access to coverage, affordability, and adequacy. This chapter describes the landscape of laws and regulations that address health care coverage and the complicated interactions between state and federal requirements that can make these protections challenging for consumers to navigate. In this chapter, it is not possible to cover every single state and federal requirement for private plans, so the focus is on the primary laws and regulations that apply to private insurance coverage.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Open Enrollment\nWe’ve got your plan.

No one was badly injured, and we could all get out of the bus okay. We found ourselves next to a themed restaurant with a plaster statue of King Kong outside.\nI knew most of the other passengers, and we chatted together in English while we waited for the police, laughing in the slightly hysterical way that follows frightening events. It was late December, just a couple of days after Christmas, and we were in India for the World Universities Debating Championship. The bus service had been provided by the competition organizers, to take us directly from the airport to the hotel where we’d be staying free of charge for the duration of the tournament. The accident was an unexpected interruption of this schedule.\nThis wasn’t the first time I’d travelled overseas for a debating competition. I was familiar with how unlike ordinary travel it felt. A tight, transparent seal separated the competition from its setting: as long as you were in a place only in order to debate there, you could expect to encounter only the same privileged, English-speaking university students you had seen on the previous trip. You could also expect immaculate accommodation and relatively fast Wi-Fi. In Manila, two years before, a police escort had chaperoned our air-conditioned buses past roadside dwellings made partly of cardboard advertisements. No one failed to notice this fact, but what was there to say about it?\nThe bus driver in India was either unable to speak English or understandably reluctant to do so. Chennai is not a wealthy city, and he was not driving a bus full of gum-chewing college students to a luxury hotel at four in the morning for the good for his health. The passengers, a few of whom were American law students, complained freely despite his inattention. The legal responsibilities of the competition organizers were discussed. Formal avenues of redress were mentioned. Though I was slightly embarrassed at this posturing, I didn’t do anything about it. We all felt overwrought, not because the accident itself was so bad, but because something we had taken for stable was now not stable; the little seal of protection had ruptured. This didn’t feel like something we had agreed to.\nOnce the driver had spoken to the police, a new bus arrived. There was daylight by then, though it was a foggy urban light, as if filtered through milk. The driver helped us to move our luggage, but he did not accompany us on the new bus; we left him behind with a wrecked vehicle and two traffic police. I knew he had endangered our lives by falling asleep like that, but I still had the sense he was probably the most sympathetic figure on the scene.\nWhen I was twenty-two, I was the number one competitive debater on the continent of Europe. After that I quit competing for good. In Chennai, I was just working as a volunteer in exchange for the cost of my flights and accommodation. I hadn’t really wanted to attend, but I found myself repeating phrases like ‘It’s a free trip to India’, until eventually I accepted the offer. When we got to the hotel that day I went straight up to my room and fell asleep. I woke up hours later, with all my clocks still on Irish time. It was after 10 p.m. locally. I padded downstairs to the lobby on my own, past the enormous Christmas tree and out the back entrance to the pool. Nobody else was outside, and the only light came up from underwater, the sting of blue chlorine. The pool was surrounded by trees. I sat on the tiled rim with my feet in the water for a while. In hotel rooms overhead, I could see people opening windows and switching lights on and off, but I couldn’t hear their voices. I heard nothing. And eventually I went back inside alone.\n2\nCollege debaters are just students wearing ill-fitting formal clothes, and most of them aren’t even very good. But, crucially, some of them kind of are. When I first started attending college debates, I was a nearly friendless teenager living away from home for the first time; for me, the most talented speakers seemed to possess a subtle power and command that was almost glamorous. I started watching debates every week, just sitting in the audience, mostly on my own. I studied the speakers’ retorts and gestures, and tried to replicate them in everyday conversation. I even nursed intense romantic obsessions over droll counterfactuals.\nCollege societies always need new members, so it wasn’t difficult to insinuate myself into this environment. Very soon I was making friends with committee members, staying out late after debates, and laughing sycophantically at everyone’s jokes. This kind of social landscape was different from anything I’d encountered before. For one thing, its structure was very clear. Popularity was not a mysterious arrangement of personal loyalties within a social code I didn’t understand: it was essentially just the same thing as success. Successful people were popular. You knew whose jokes to laugh at, because they were the people who gave the best speeches and said the cleverest things. I found this transparency encouraging somehow. The allocation of points in a debate was something clear and definable, and its effects on the distribution of social capital seemed clear and definable too. The more I observed the structure of public debates, the more I thought: I could do this. I could be successful and popular too.\nDebating competitions take place at weekends throughout the academic year. To speak competitively, you need a partner: British Parliamentary style, the kind of debating common to the European and World Championships, requires teams of two. The bigger Irish tournaments host sixty or seventy such teams, as well as adjudicators, over the course of five group rounds, in which all teams participate, and then semi-finals and a final. An extensive specialized vocabulary exists to describe these relatively ordinary events. The rankings of teams and individual speakers, for example, are called ‘the tab’. When the tab is released at the end of a competition, either in stapled paper copies or online, everyone searches for their own name, and then their partner’s name, and then the names of people they especially like or hate. It doesn’t take long to pick that up.\nAt first I found the competitions almost unbearably exhilarating. I suffered from such intense nerves that I often couldn’t eat anything until the debating was finished. I also lost most of the debates I took part in. At the time, I was happy just sitting in the audience for the final and applauding at the right moments. I was self-deprecating about my own abilities, and sanguine in the face of defeat. Judges told me I had potential to improve, and obviously I felt this prospect was worth the continual low-level humiliation of failure. It’s hard to imagine my way back into that mindset now. I don’t think I will ever again want something so meaningless so much.\nI was nineteen when I started debating competitively, and it’s probably fair to say that most things I did when I was nineteen were motivated by a desperation to be liked. I wasn’t only willing to lose debates: I was willing to tell all my secrets, to lend money when I couldn’t afford to, and to date anyone who showed an interest in me, no matter how dull or aggressive. I had low self-esteem and a predilection for hero-worship, and I was extremely determined. This was probably the perfect cocktail of tendencies for the novice debater. But by the time I could see that, I wasn’t a novice anymore.\n3\nCompetitive university debating requires of its participants a particular intersection of personal qualities. You have to enjoy talking out loud in front of people. You need to have a taste for ritualized, abstract interpersonal aggression. You have to be willing to tolerate physical and mental discomfort: weekends of sleeplessness, bad food or no food, and interminable group conversations about how tired and ill everybody feels. And you have to learn how to lose.\nThousands of students, probably tens of thousands worldwide, get involved in college debating every year; but few persevere, and so at the highest levels it is a relatively small community. At the big international tournaments, all the most accomplished speakers and judges know each other, and other people constellate around them in order of status. It is, at every level, a hierarchically organized activity. The more successful you are, the more people will stand around listening to you when you talk about how tired and ill you feel.\nThe economics of college debating are a little mysterious. Student societies collect membership fees, and raise money from sponsors and their universities in order to cover the costs of registering for competitions. The major competitions are also funded by corporate sponsors and by the host universities. Travel is often heavily or fully subsidized. Meals of varying quality appear on plates. Alcoholic beverages disappear from white tablecloths. Attendees need spend little or no money in the course of a competition.\nHaving established themselves on the competitive circuit, the most successful debaters are often offered funding to judge competitions in other countries. Sometimes you’ll get a spare room in a fellow debater’s loft apartment, sometimes a double room in a hotel. If you’re wise, you ask the organizers to book the flights for you in advance. You are almost always flying alone, and soon become skilled at asking strangers to place your luggage in the overhead compartment. Every person at the event will know your name; some of them will even want to talk to you. At a certain point, you are turning down more free trips than you take.\nThere’s no use joining a debating club with this jackpot in sight. Most debaters will never be invited on fully-paid weekend trips to Paris or Berlin. After logging a year or two of boring, thankless attendance at local competitions, most people generally tap out. Only the perverse few continue, slowly climbing up the rankings, trying to sleep through 4 a.m. flights, falling behind on academic deadlines. A very small handful, generally from a particularly elite background, are successful from the off. But for most, the cosmopolitan, nomadic existence of the minor celebrity debater is out of reach. There are probably only a few hundred of them in the world.\n4\nYou get your topic and your position, you and your partner go off and sit in a corridor to talk about austerity or the Iraq War for fifteen minutes, and then the debate starts. There are four teams of two in every debate: two proposition teams, and two on the opposition. You have no say over where you end up. A speaker from the first proposition team proposes the motion, then one from the first opposition team responds. Then it’s back to proposition, and so on. You must be clear in your attempts to get the better of the teams arguing the opposite side of the question, but subtle in undermining the other team that’s arguing your side. It’s against the rules to contradict them openly. Instead, you need to emphasize at every opportunity that your arguments are the more important.\nFor me, the speaking part was easy, something like the experience of particularly quick and effortless typing: you think the words, and then the words appear on the screen, without any real awareness of the intermediary process. You think the concepts, and then the concepts express themselves. You hear yourself constructing syntactically elaborate sentences, one after another, but you don’t necessarily have the sensation that you are the person doing it.\nThere are a lot of different names for this state of immersion. The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi would call it ‘flow’: that form of focus so clear that all distractions, even the ego itself, fall away. Fast Eddie Felson, the pool-playing protagonist of The Hustler, talks about it too. ‘You don’t have to look, you just know,’ he says. ‘You make shots that nobody’s ever made before. And you play the game the way nobody’s ever played it.’ Hitting that perfect rhythm while speaking, connecting concept to response, drawing examples out of thin air, you feel just like I imagine a pool shark must. Complex things become simple.\nFor my first couple of seasons as a debater, the word I heard most often from my adjudicators was ‘passionate’; another word I heard was ‘forceful’. These weren’t insults: judges genuinely seemed to appreciate my passion and forcefulness. But I didn’t want to debate in order to express passion: I wanted to be aloof and cerebral like the speakers I most admired. Nothing had prepared me for this encounter with my own apparent ardour. I had been given the very straightforward task of improvising some arguments and then expressing them to various groups of people. So what kind of impassioned person had I suddenly become?\nMaybe this kind of performance – pretending, weekend after weekend, to be passionate about whichever side of a debate I happened to be on – had some subconscious purpose. After all, debating is competitive, and competition necessitates a kind of aggression. Maybe faking conviction is how I learned to control and direct that aggression, to hide my ambition behind concern. Or maybe I knew that where aloofness in men is seen as mysterious, in women it’s seen as cold. If you’re a girl, judges don’t just want to know you’re smart; they want to know you care. Perhaps I was a better strategist than I knew.\nCompetitive debating takes argument’s essential features and reimagines them as a game. For the purposes of this game, the emotional or relational aspects of argument are superfluous, and at the end there are winners. Everyone tacitly understands that it’s not a real argument. Imagine if all conflict was like this: you don’t have to get upset or angry, everyone will listen to you even if they don’t want to, and at the end of the discussion a nice man with a British accent will tell you that the game is over now and you’ve won. I think in a way it was this fantasy of invulnerability, of total control, that made me keep returning, weekend after weekend. All the pleasures of conflict without ever really showing my hand.\nAt the end of my first year of debating, I took part in a competition at Dublin City University. My partner was a vastly accomplished debater called Niamh, who looked on me as a kind of mentee, and told me what to say in the round about the International Criminal Court. I was awarded the prize for the best novice speaker that night, the first thing I’d ever won debating: a large, luminously green bottle of absinthe. Niamh and I also shared a modest cash prize for best team. Later that night I stood outside someone’s house party with the other novices and took turns drinking from the bottle until my vision started to go blurry and everything was amusing. Then we got a taxi back into town, which I paid for. I had never felt more popular or wealthy in my life.\n5\nTo participate in an international competition, like the European or World Championships, you often have to try out first. The number of teams that can attend is limited, and because of the prestige and the funded travel, demand usually exceeds supply. Some debating societies allocate these team spots on the basis of past performance, while others will hold special trials over the course of a day or a weekend, ranking and matching up the best speakers who attend. Once you secure a place, you’re expected to take it seriously. Your college society might hire a coach, or at least put together a training schedule; they will almost certainly expect you to run practice debates and fly to other countries for prep competitions. After all, they’re paying, and their international reputation is at stake too.\nThis period of preparation before a major competition is exhausting. You are perpetually taking the cheapest, latest (or earliest) flights to dull university towns. You spend incalculably long stretches of time feeling cold and tired with people who are not in any meaningful sense your friends. Meanwhile, your ordinary life continues, as if at a different speed. You miss various birthday parties and academic deadlines. It is difficult for even the most avid novice to sustain their enthusiasm through this period; it was impossible for me. That seven-minute interval of mild euphoria during which I actually delivered my speech came to seem like a tinier and tinier oasis in a desert of spiritual exhaustion and food served in plastic wrap.\nIt’s also hard to stay impressed. By the time I was attending major championships, the speakers who had seemed so formidable when I first started out had graduated and left debating behind, or stayed around for long enough to become unremarkable. The machinery that drives effective speeches isn’t lastingly mysterious: observe it for long enough and you can see the moving parts. The harder I practised, the harder it was to recapture that sense of glamour that motivated me in the beginning. And where, sitting in the audience, I used to burst into applause, now I found myself thinking: That seems like an overly broad generalization. Or: Must so many male speakers really use rape as a metaphor for something else?\nWhen I first started out, I knew nothing at all about the outside world. I didn’t know when the war in Afghanistan had started, or what the Patriot Act was, or where exactly the Arab Spring was happening. In the very beginning, I accepted defeat in debates on such subjects with good humour; after that, I made some disastrous attempts to fake my way through them; eventually, I just started reading the news.\nThe year I was twenty-one, the European Championships were held in Belgrade. It was August, and temperatures reached forty degrees in the city. We debated in classrooms, often without air-conditioning; the organizers gave us free plastic bottles of water between rounds while everyone discussed the rumours that someone had fainted mid-speech. My teammate Adam and I made it to the quarter-finals, where the topic concerned the secession of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina. I knew almost nothing about Bosnia, but Adam had brought some handwritten notes which we read during prep time. These knock-out rounds are staged in lecture halls or auditoriums rather than classrooms, and attract an audience of eliminated speakers, idle judges and off-duty volunteers from the hosting university. As a result, quite a few of our audience members that day were Serbian debaters. Maybe they sat there, appalled and insulted by our ignorance, or by the composed self-assurance with which we fabricated the history of their region. More likely, they were just used to it. It wasn’t our intention to be offensive. We sailed into the semi-finals that year.\nThe European and World Debating Championships are held in English, and though there are special categories for the recognition of speakers for whom English is a second language, Anglophone countries dominate the main competition. At first this convention seems arbitrary: debates have to take place in some shared language or not at all, and debating about France or Germany through English had never particularly bothered me. But now my English-language upbringing had deposited me at the top of a lecture hall in Belgrade, where I was falsifying the history of a devastating and prolonged conflict while student volunteers prepared to hand me free bottles of water. This was not the first time I had debated a weighty issue of which I knew little. I understood that debating was just a game. But to play that game on this subject, in this place, felt different.\nThe most ambitious debaters go out of their way to absorb information about sexual violence, racial profiling, police brutality: issues many of them will never experience firsthand. I did the same thing. Did it make me more empathetic and self-aware? Or did it just continue to affirm the idea that if I were smart and competitive enough, I could speak for anyone I wanted?\nCompetitive debating is, predictably, male-dominated. About two-thirds of the participants in international competitions are men, and an all-male team has won each of the last four European Championships. Official forums and meetings on the status of women in debating are held frequently and at interminable length, so that the problem of sexism can be identified and then not addressed and then identified again after we failed to address it the first time. Judges continue to advise female speakers on their tone of voice, the speed of their delivery, and the absence or presence of ‘passion’ in their performances; male speakers are typically just advised about their arguments. In Sorties, Hélène Cixous writes: ‘For woman speaking – even just opening her mouth – in public is something rash, a transgression.’ In a world saturated with the sounds of male authority, there’s always something ‘not quite’ about a woman’s voice in public. I could even hear it in my own.\nConfronted with my own minor successes, I mostly felt embarrassed. I wanted to be seen as deserving, but I didn’t want to say I was deserving. As a result, I vacillated between a weird self-righteousness and a deceitful kind of self-deprecation. Eventually, I got better at deflecting. There was always a man, somewhere, who could be credited with my achievements: if not my teammate, then my coach, and if not my coach, then one of my previous teammates. So I learned how to thank them. And then smile.\nAfter Belgrade I took some time off competing. Really I just was bored and tired, but this expressed itself as suspicion and bitterness. I no longer found it fun to think of ways in which capitalism benefits the poor, or things oppressed people should do about their oppression. Actually I found it depressing and vaguely immoral. Still, most of my friends were debaters and at social gatherings the conversation always turned back to the same list of names: who had won which competitions, who was pairing up for the next European Championships. And I still thought: I could do it. That could be me.\n6\nIn 2013, the European Championships took place in Manchester. My teammate that year was a precocious first-year called Michael who nobody on the international circuit had really heard of. Our partnership was, in the fond gaze of retrospect, almost flawless. When we prepped for debates we seemed to inhabit our own private time zone, in which everything we could possibly say or think of was exchanged effortlessly, to a degree that amused even us. We finished the competition on a record number of points, which also at the time seemed amusing. And on the individual speaker rankings, he placed second and I came first.\n‘Anything can be great,’ Fast Eddie says. ‘I don’t care, bricklaying can be great.’ But you don’t lay bricks with the intention of accumulating a record number of points, and you certainly don’t do it to attain some kind of phoney celebrity. For flow to be authentic, it has to be for its own sake. The ego has to fall away. This is not so difficult when you’re immersed in the task itself; but when the task is over, all you have left is a list of accomplishments. So maybe for a while you start believing there’s something great about those.\nPersonally, I didn’t cope very well with all the affirmation. I’d been accepted into a Master’s programme I felt uncertain about, starting the month after the European Championships ended. I’d given up competing, but I accepted almost every judging invitation I received, and spent weekends away giving detailed feedback to people I would never see again, while essay deadlines crawled past. In November I dropped out of my degree. I took on a part-time job as a debating coach and told myself I would use my free time to learn new languages or musical instruments. Inevitably, I did not use that time for any of those things. At the end of the year I accepted the volunteer job in Chennai, and rang in the New Year drinking white wine in a luxury hotel, surrounded by people who knew who I was. Some of them had probably watched YouTube videos of my speeches. As you might have guessed, I was miserable.\nComing face to face with the irrelevance of your own strivings demands some kind of response. You can wallow in the pretend celebrity if you want, continue attending competitions every weekend and dutifully appearing in selfies with beaming novices, in the belief that you are actually important. Or you can self-justify in the guise of getting some perspective: maybe try thinking of reasons why your particular niche is actually of great cultural significance, or ways in which your skill set applies to ‘real life’. People say that debating helps you in job interviews: that’s one particularly egregious example. But even if any of that could explain why you do it, it could never explain why success matters. Participation in a game, any kind of game, gives you new ways of perceiving others. Victory only gives you new ways of perceiving yourself.\nSuccess doesn’t come from within; it’s given to you by other people, and other people can take it away. In part, this is why I stopped competing. I didn’t want to give up the feeling of flow, that perfect, self-eliminating focus, but I didn’t want to perform it for points any more. Academic life had presented me with much the same problem: I thought about things only as hard and as thoroughly as my grades required. Maybe I stopped debating to see if I could still think of things to say when there weren’t any prizes. To a greater or lesser extent, I am still working on that.\nI still get invitations to judge, even occasionally to compete. It’s hard to explain that you’re turning people down because it would interfere with your attempts to get some perspective: who needs perspective on a game you play at weekends? So instead I usually just say I’m ‘not available’. I refrain from getting involved. I even try being humble. After all, nothing in the outside world has changed as a result of my accumulation of debating accolades. I haven’t contributed to anyone’s understanding of anything, except maybe my own, and that only partially.\nBut I did it. I got everything I set out to get. I was the one delivering the offhanded refutation. It was me sipping water while I waited for the end of the applause. I still occasionally feel an impulse to attribute all my achievements that year to my perfect teammate, or worse, to good luck. But I’m not nineteen anymore; I don’t need to make people feel comfortable. In the end, it was me. It may not mean anything to anyone else, but it doesn’t have to – that’s the point. I was number one. Like Fast Eddie, I’m the best there is. And even if you beat me, I’m still the best.\nTo read the rest of Dublin Review 58, you may purchase the issue here.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Ad Orientem: Thoughts on debating the non-essential\nBy Dr. Jeff Mirus ( bio - articles - email ) | Jul 15, 2016\nWhen it comes to discussions of the liturgy, some readers find my viewpoint appalling, while others regard it as a breath of fresh air. The reason is fairly simple: I have an extremely “intellectual” piety, which means I find nearly every liturgical form and setting to be a distraction rather than an aid to worship. For me the best liturgical form and setting for the Mass is the simplest. I have no tendency to dress the Mass up with human ornamentation, attempting to make it more beautiful than it already is in itself. I am certainly annoyed by studied indifference or cheap frivolity, but I am also left cold by elaborate ceremony (both in the Mass and elsewhere).\nMy favorite Mass has always been the unadorned daily “low” Mass of the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite, said in my own language. As far as suiting my own piety goes, nothing else comes close. I don’t go to Mass to be moved emotionally. This applies equally to elaborate musical settings, particular liturgical “styles”, and efforts to make the community feel good about itself. It is true that I revere Palestrina and generally deplore “Glory and Praise”, but—just between you and me—I find that both distract me from the essence of the Mass.\nWhat is the value of all this embarrassing self-disclosure? Simply this: It is important to reflect on how our own personalities, tastes, and piety affect our judgment of liturgy. If we recognize that we each respond to God on somewhat different wavelengths—or, to put it differently, that we are all inherently biased in different ways—we can escape false certainties about what is “the right way” to do things. Liturgical discussion can be less passionate, and far more fruitful.\nIn any case, before anyone decides to burn me at the stake, I should point out that, whatever else might be said about my own liturgical preferences, my sensibilities at least put me within the tradition of that “noble simplicity” which is supposed to be the chief characteristic of the Roman Rite. Detracting from the Rite’s nobility by banal translations or any sort of frivolity is out. But so is detracting from the Rite’s simplicity by convoluted phraseology, excessive repetition, or elaborate cultural ornamentation.\nThe Mass, of course, must have a form; if it were formless it could not be the Mass (or anything else). That form, obviously, ought not only to effect but to communicate the fundamental purpose of the Mass. It should draw those present to unite themselves to the sacred action—the making present of the Word in Scripture; of the Word made flesh in obedient sacrifice to the Father for the remission of sin; and of the Word physically ingested so that we may be assimilated to Christ, extending and building the Mystical Body of Christ—that is, the Church, the Kingdom of God. Moreover, the particular form which is used to make all this present and active must be established by Christ’s own authority in the Church He established. The Church is the sole custodian of these sacred mysteries.\nThis means that the first requirement for authentic participation in the Church’s liturgy is the same sort of obedience to the Church that Our Lord offered to His Father in effecting our salvation. No matter how strongly we may feel about this or that manner of “celebrating” the Mass, the single most important factor in the attitude we bring to Mass is obedience to the Church. This applies equally to bishops, priests, deacons, religious, and laity, according to the example of Christ: “Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered” (Heb 5:8), and “being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross” (Phil 2:8).\nCautionary Principles\nIn this context, an assessment of the best liturgical forms and settings is inescapably hampered by two problems which can never be reduced to a single solution. The first problem is that the Mass is an exceedingly rich mystery. Indeed, it is a grand mystery which contains many mysteries. God encompasses this richness in His own fullness, but we humans grasp mystery from our poverty, by focusing on one aspect at a time, only gradually coming to a balanced apprehension of something approaching the whole.\nThis problem results in a key liturgical principle: (1) It is impossible to devise a liturgical form which conveys the full richness of the sacred mysteries; it is inescapable that each form and setting will highlight some realities and, in that very process, obscure others.\nThe second problem is that each human personality tends to see and respond positively to some goods more than others, and to react differently to proposed goods that may be only imperfectly understood, or indeed not understood at all. This problem results in a second liturgical principle: (2) No single liturgical form or setting is best for everyone, nor best for anyone all the time.\nAn argument can be made (I know, because I have made it) that, assuming we are properly disposed, a liturgy that we find ugly or annoying—a liturgy which causes us to suffer—will do us more spiritual good than one which satisfies our own particular sensibilities, no matter how “right” we believe those sensibilities to be. There is not one of us who is worthy of the Mass, no matter how badly it is celebrated. The greatest benefit lies in recognizing our own poverty in the face of the Divine mystery, instead of permitting the manner of celebration to distract and anger us—or permitting our souls to become attached to the splendor of the celebration more than to its essential action.\nAd Orientem\nWith this in mind, let us consider the controversy stirred by Cardinal Robert Sarah’s recommendation, as Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship, that priests celebrate Mass ad orientem (literally, “to the East”). Phil Lawler, who clearly feels more strongly about this than I do, has provided excellent commentary and follow-up on the reaction Cardinal Sarah has provoked. Judging by this reaction, you would think the Cardinal’s suggestion is somehow unspeakably novel and seriously dangerous! The resistance may have a sinister element, of course; it may be rooted in the secularism which has so sadly warped Catholic judgment in our day. At the same time, it seems only fair to recall that we are speaking here of an option that already exists but is almost never used. Whatever the reasons for this neglect when so many other options are used regularly, we must acknowledge that the ad orientem posture is not a prioriity for huge numbers of Catholic bishops and priests.\nHaving said this, there are still three main reasons for preferring this orientation (as opposed to versus populum, “facing the people”):\n- First, in the context of early Mediterranean and European Catholicism, it became traditional to orient churches on an east-west axis, so that when the priest said Mass he and the congregation could face toward Jerusalem, the geographical location of our salvation in the passion, death and Resurrection of Christ.\n- Second, and at least partly because the sun may be taken as a powerful symbol of the Divine light, this eastward orientation became associated with looking toward the coming of the Redeemer—looking toward the coming of Christ in glory. But here the direction is specified in Our Lord’s own words: “For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of man” (Mt 24:27).\n- Third, the “ad orientem” directionality typically means that the priest and people will face the same direction, such that the emphasis in the liturgical form is on the priest’s offering of the Eucharistic sacrifice in persona Christi to the Father.\nThis third point is rather obviously at the very center of the argument today. After all, not all Catholic churches are oriented on the East-West axis and, obviously, there are many places in the Catholic world now where facing east orients us toward Jerusalem only the long way around, or where we must face some other direction (such as north or south) to look toward Jerusalem at all. (You may smile, but I recently received a message from a Catholic in Malaysia who asked what the value was of facing east there, since nobody really wanted to look toward Korea or Japan.) For the first two points then, we are left primarily with a symbolic rather than a literal meaning—although I hasten to add that there is nothing wrong with that.\nAs many commentators have noted (most prominently Joseph Ratzinger before he became pope), when the priest stands at the head of the people, all facing (symbolically) toward Christ, it reduces the emphasis on the Eucharistic dimension of community formation and increases the emphasis on the Eucharistic dimension of propitiation and sacrifice to the Father. It seems very reasonable, then, that if the Church finds this shift in emphasis will create a more accurate and more balanced appreciation of the sacred mysteries, then increasing the use of the ad orientem posture might play a very salutary role in our time.\nThe Other Side\nBut other legitimate thoughts are quite possible. The Last Supper is the pre-eminent model for the Mass, and (presumably) was not orchestrated in this way. The Mass is also a sacred meal in which we eat Christ’s Body and drink His blood, a veritable foretaste of the heavenly banquet. The positive theological elements which received new emphasis with the introduction of the versus populum posture in 1968 include the universal priesthood, the universal call to holiness, the social dimensions of Eucharistic transformation, and an awareness of baptism as an initiation into the full Eucharistic life of the Church.\nTo take just one example, lay people fifty years ago would often say that they had “heard” Mass. The linguistic implication is that the Mass was something that priests alone did, and it was the privilege of the laity to listen in as they did it. I would not want to press the implication too far, but it is worth noting that even those with the greatest appreciation for Holy Orders do not use this language today. The point is that, with versus populum, we are not dealing with something that lacks its own intrinsic Catholic value.\nYet the strongest argument for the ad orientem posture remains. Although he did nothing about this as pope, Joseph Ratzinger suggested just what we have been discussing. He thought it likely that the ad orientem posture could refocus our attention on the sacred character—the very real “otherness”—of the Mass, and so might serve as a corrective to congregational narcissism. To accept this argument, of course, one must accept that there is an excessive celebration of the community in Catholic worship today, with too little emphasis on the need to transcend merely human community; and that the versus populum orientation contributes significantly to this problem.\nMy own dilemma is that I can accept the first point without accepting the second. I agree that an excessive, non-repentant and often frivolous celebration of the community is far too common today. But I am not so sure that this has been in any significant sense caused by the orientation of the priest. Self-celebration, shallowness, secularism, and frivolity vary greatly from place to place, even when the orientation of the priest does not change. One may well ask whether it was really the versus populum posture which led to our contemporary diminution of the sense of the sacred at Mass.\nUnanswered (Unanswerable?) Questions\nMany have suggested that priests tend to become “personalities” who occupy center stage when they face the people, eliminating our focus on the sacred mysteries themselves. But is this really true? Related questions: Has there never been a kind of showy, regal pomposity in those who have celebrated Mass “facing East”, both before 1968 and in some quarters today? Have there been only a very few instances of priests facing East who mumble through their prayers with little care and less understanding? Has no priest facing East ever rushed through Mass, eschewing both reverence and contact with his people? Have the faithful always, or even typically, joined themselves to the central realities of the Mass whenever the ad orientem posture was the norm?\nAnd, perhaps more important: Have we not seen many fine priests in more recent years who are perfectly capable of celebrating Mass facing the people with a becoming care and dignity, keeping their focus and that of the congregation clearly on Christ throughout?\nIt may be that versus populum was not so much a cause as one more opportunity for abuse by those who, for reasons that we have discussed many times before, had already fallen into a narcissistic secularism, devoid of that reverence, obedience and joy which is proper to the celebration of all the sacraments of the Church. At some point in all such historical discussions, we must beware of the common fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc. The orientation question may be critical. Or it may not.\nFinally, we must beware of all the personal, cultural and theological variables: What impact will a reversal of orientation have on people today? Will it be just another change that impresses on them the Church’s lack of stability? If it becomes another frequently used option (not a norm), will this enhance or undermine our sense of liturgical timelessness? One of the problems with the liturgical changes following the Second Vatican Council (I mean apart from failing to follow the Council’s directives, poor implementation and widespread disobedience) was the introduction of rapid and sweeping changes which seemed to put everything up for grabs. This was a very bad way to communicate the eternal! How do we make improvements without falling into the same trap?\nAt the risk of even greater self-disclosure, I will confess that I am uncomfortable with liturgical surprises (read “options”). Like a child (every child is a traditionalist when it comes to family celebrations), I want tomorrow’s Mass to be said “right”—meaning the same way it was said yesterday. As a case in point, I do not like flipping between two versions of the Creed (the Nicene and the Apostles’). Predictability is, for me, a significant liturgical virtue. Do options foster novelty?\nMore questions: If most people today have never experienced ad orientem before (and they haven’t), will it seem strange, off-putting, or rude (as a straw poll among my very Catholic grandchildren suggests)? Will the message be that the laity are more involved in the action of the Mass, or less? Even if the necessity of Holy Orders becomes more obvious, will the priestly character of all the baptized be less fully understood, reducing their felt responsibility for mission and holiness? (See liturgical principles 1 and 2, above.)\nI do not know the answers. The debate is certainly legitimate; it ought to be of at least passing interest to anyone who cares about building up the Body of Christ. It is obviously of interest to me. But I do not know the answers, and I have no horse in the race. I also have no liturgical talents, and no vocation to that very significant sphere of Catholic service. What I do know is that the word “Eucharist” means thanksgiving—as in “thanksgiving for the works of God”. And since I am unworthy of even the meanest Mass, I intend to remain grateful for all of them.\nAll comments are moderated.

When I would attend daily Mass at the Catholic Center at Georgia Tech, it was a model of simplicity: 18 minutes of liturgical cadence and silence. After our FSSP community was established, I have nearly exclusively attended the Low Mass: 50-60 minutes of organized periods of priest-server back and forth. The exceptions are dialogue and sung Masses, where the whole of the laity join the server in offering the responses. In between the dialog is blessed silence.\n-\nPosted by: jeremiahjj -\nJul. 15, 2016 5:26 PM ET USA\nI stand with those who wish the priest would \"turn around.\" I went from being a 20-year-old Methodist to an Episcopalian in 1956 and thought it weird that the priest faced away from the people. Then I found out why it was done that way. Now that I'm 80 and have been Roman Catholic for 25 years, I still do not like priests facing the people because too many of them react to us instead of God the Father. Turn 'em back around. Them's my thoughts, to use bad grammar. Others are welcome to differ.\n-\nPosted by: koinonia -\nJul. 15, 2016 2:54 PM ET USA\nHistorically speaking two points are of interest. First is that so much of the Mass of 1970 proved so similar to changes implemented by protestant reformers as did the reasons provided. Second, we have the copious writings of popes, prelates and saints about the liturgy. These writings reflect clearly a certain temperance that is essential to any discussion of the topic. They reflect sobriety and even intransigence. Traditionally that wisdom animates any prudent discussion of the liturgy.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The vote is the most recent occurrence in the Buckhead City saga that started modestly in 2020 but quickly picked up steam as a notably polarizing issue among residents and business owners. It also sets up what could be a consequential battle for future cityhood efforts statewide.\nAttempts to create a Buckhead municipality aren’t without precedence as a group of disgruntled residents first floated the idea in 2008, and cityhood was brought back into discussion in 2016 during former Mayor Kasim Reed’s last term in office, which was riddled with corruption. Those rumblings continued into 2017 after Keisha Lance Bottoms narrowly defeated Buckhead resident Mary Norwood in the Atlanta mayoral race. Simultaneously, a referendum for the Eagle’s Landing community to secede from Stockbridge failed but illustrated a path for Buckhead residents to potentially cast their own vote on cityhood.\nAmid a backdrop of increasing crime and some residents’ continued frustrations over city services, the idea of creating a Buckhead municipality gained momentum in 2020. The politics surrounding the issue quickly became partisan and led to the creation of two organizations — the Buckhead City Council lobbying in favor of cityhood and the Committee for A United Atlanta opposed to the municipality.\nWith the State Senate voting down the bill on the municipality March 2, the Buckhead City movement appears to have been put on pause for now, providing a respite for both supporters and detractors of cityhood after nearly three years of significant battles. The following are key moments in the cityhood movement leading to the bill’s failure and where the Buckhead City effort stands for the future.\nJuly 2020\nFirst Rumblings and First Opposition\nRumors of semi-organized talk flew until finally came the emergence of the Buckhead Exploratory Committee — now known as the Buckhead City Committee — in semi-public virtual meetings. Members, who would not identify themselves, talked about a variety of options: cityhood, annexation into another city, or just sending a complaint to the mayor. They also discussed the racial implications of a majority-white neighborhood leaving Atlanta, which became a major issue of the debate, and said racists would not be welcome in the movement. Opposition quickly emerged from Bottoms, former Mayor Sam Massell, and four major local organizations: the Buckhead Community Improvement District, the Buckhead Coalition, the Buckhead Business Association and Livable Buckhead.\nJanuary-February 2021\nThe BCC Goes Public\nThe BCC went public in a January meeting that made cityhood the focus and sought money for polling. By February it finally identified its leaders and hired lobbyists to work the legislature.\nMarch 2021\nLegislation Round One\nState Sen. Brandon Beach (R-Alpharetta) and state Rep. Todd Jones (R-South Forsyth) squeeze cityhood bills into the end of the legislative session. As rough-draft forms, the move largely served as political publicity.\nMay 2021\nFirst Forum, First Opposition Group\nThe first cityhood forum was held at a virtual meeting of the Buckhead Council of Neighborhoods, with White on the supporter side and Linda Klein, a Buckhead Coalition member, on the opposition side. A week later, the opposition group Committee for a United Atlanta emerged with Klein as its co-chair alongside Edward Lindsey, a former state rep. for Buckhead.\nAugust 2021\nEarly Polling\nA BCC poll found majority support for holding a vote on the cityhood question, though it did not ask about a position on cityhood itself. The poll also revealed a deep partisan divide on the question, with local Republicans overwhelming in support and a plurality of Democrats opposed. Subsequent polls by the BCC and CUA found a continuing partisan divide, and by January 2022, the CUA reported opposition was rising and was maybe the majority position.\nSeptember 2021\nDueling Studies\nThe BCC released a feasbility study showing Buckhead City would work in sheer revenue-and-expenditure terms. The study was a legally required step for cityhood legislation to continue moving ahead. The CUA quickly followed with a counter-study saying cityhood would blow huge holes in the City of Atlanta and Atlanta Public Schools budgets, opening other unanswered questions about bond debt and whether APS could operate legally in another city.\nOctober-November 2021\nPolitical Campaigns Begin\nAtlanta’s state Senate and House delegations — including all Buckhead legislators — announce they will fight cityhood bills. On Halloween, the BCC opens a campaign headquarters on Peachtree Road, which the City later cited for alleged sign violations, triggering a First Amendment lawsuit from the group. In November, Sen. Beach again pre-files a cityhood bill.\nNovember-December 2021\nOpposition Grows\nCityhood opposition grows, with North Atlanta Parents for Public Schools saying it will back the Atlanta Board of Education’s fight against the idea, and the formation of a new grassroots group called Neighbors for a United Atlanta.\nNovember 2021\nNew Mayor Elected\nAndre Dickens is elected as the new mayor in a late-November runoff against Felicia Moore, the more locally favored contender. However, both candidates opposed cityhood and the BCC denounced both. Dickens quickly takes a hands-on approach to countering cityhood, attending local meetings, joining opposition group events, and touting a yet-to-open police mini-precinct in Buckhead.\nDecember 2021-January 2022\nWhite’s social media controversies\nBCC leader White was already controversial for some insulting and incorrect public commentary, and his past involvement in fundraising scandals. But he triggered widespread public outrage over racial remarks. First he called Dickens a racist, then followed up by retweeting comments from the white nationalist affiliated website VDARE attributing crime to Black populations. White apologized for the latter post, but in February again drew outrage in social media comments that spun a debate about funding for a MARTA project into a conspiracy theory that its CEO’s recent suicide was due to a non-existent theft of money.\nDecember 2021-January 2022\nPolitical Chess Games Begin\nWhile White made incendiary comments, cityhood opponents began a political chess game. The City Council passed bond refinancing that included a “poison pill” putting a new Buckhead City on the hook for a huge payment. Lt. Gov. Duncan assigned the Senate version of cityhood legislation to all-Democrat committee, giving it bleak prospects. And Buckhead’s lawmakers plotted legislation requiring a cityhood referendum to be held citywide, not just in the neighborhood, and require a supermajority to win.\nFebruary 2022\nThe Cityhood Movement Gets Shot Down\nThe push to create a Buckhead municipality was effectively quelled with then Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and the late House Speaker David Ralston announcing they would not allow cityhood legislation to proceed for the 2022 state legislative session. The move from some of the state’s top GOP officials resulted in the state Senate not taking up the bill, and with passage required for both chambers to include the cityhood referendum on the 2022 ballot, the cityhood movement was not introduced in the State House.\nBoth Ralston and Duncan announced they would not take up the issue under the Gold Dome to allow then newly elected Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens an opportunity to reduce violent crime.\nIn response, the BCC said it would continue its fight with White remaining in his role leading the organization. The committee also said it would continue fundraising and urged its members and supporters to keep up the cause.\nJune 2022\nDickens Notes A Reduction In Crime\nA new APD precinct began operating in Buckhead on West Paces Ferry Road in a move to help combat crime in the area. Dickens used the opportunity to note that personal and property crime were down 12 percent year-over-year. However, cityhood supporters remained un-swayed.\nSeptember 2022\nPolitical squabbling continues\nThe Buckhead cityhood movement was briefly again at the forefront of political infighting after Atlanta City Council member Mary Norwood took Atlanta to task for “neglecting” Buckhead. In an op-ed published by Insider Advantage, Norwood wrote the issues concerning cityhood go beyond crime.\n“It boils down to many years of Buckhead’s neglect by the city of Atlanta’s government,” Norwood wrote. She cited issues of unfulfilled requests for capital plans from the city’s government, misuse of TSPLOST funds, neglected roads, the denial of a study on potential traffic mitigation solutions, clearcutting from unchecked development and zoning complaints.\nDickens’ administration countered by stating many of Norwood’s concerns are being addressed and took issue with Norwood’s article missing “context or accuracy.”\nFebruary 2023\nBuckhead City Movement Passes A Major Milestone\nThe creation of the “City of Buckhead City” fight was fully renewed with two separate State Senate bills introduced calling for Buckhead residents to vote on de-annexation and the creation of the municipality on the 2024 ballot. Like previously proposed legislation, both bills were sponsored by lawmakers outside of the Buckhead area.\nThe bills outlined some key aspects of how Buckhead City would operate, including the creation of a city council with six districts. Other stipulations included sky-high payments to the proposed city’s mayor — $225,000 per year for the first four years in office. Under the proposals, the City of Atlanta would also be required to sell the new city assets at bargain prices, including $100-per-acre for parkland, $5,000 for existing fire stations and $100,000 each for the water and sewer systems under the city’s proposed borders.\nThe bills passed a major hurdle as they were approved by the Senate State and Local Governments Operations Committee, which voted 4-3 along party lines, with Republicans in favor, to advance the proposals. The votes marked the first time in which a Buckhead cityhood bill had advanced out of committee.\nDuring hearings on the bills, the BCC continued to argue that those in Buckhead should be given the opportunity to vote on cityhood, while those opposed presented a litany of potential issues the bills would create.\nThose concerns were brought to a head by a Feb. 28 memo from Gov. Brian Kemp’s administration outlining 11 key issues with the bills, stating they “demand evaluation for the unique constitutional and statutory challenges” they present. The memo directed lawmakers to address the issues before considering the bills. No such actions were taken publicly.\nMarch 2023\nBuckhead City Proposals Fail\nThe incorporation of Buckhead City was killed for the 2023 legislative session on March 2 with SB 114 failing on the Senate floor. The measure was voted down 33-23 with all Democrats in opposition and 10 Republican representatives crossing the aisle to cast “nay” votes. On the same day, SB 113, another bill calling for Buckhead cityhood, was tabled by the chamber.\nThe Committee for A United Atlanta released a statement thanking supporters for their “major role” in the senate voting down the legislation while outlining that “many of the issues that drove this debate remain.” The letter noted the group will continue working with Mayor Dickens, the Atlanta City Council and the community to “keep the focus” on public safety, city services and that Buckhead residents have their voices heard.\nMeanwhile, the BCC has seemingly called its quits on the cityhood movement, at least for now.\nA BCC email sent to supporters and posted to its Facebook page said “there is no path forward for a cityhood referendum” until Kemp’s current term ends. Kemp’s term ends on January 11, 2027. The BCC’s letter alleged that Kemp’s administration worked “behind closed doors” to kill the bill.\n“Although we had hoped for a different outcome this legislative session, we will continue to work for the cityhood referendum in the future,” the letter said.\nWhat’s Next For The Buckhead Cityhood Movement?\nWith the BCC’s role spearheading the cityhood movement and the group’s announcement they are putting efforts on pause while Kemp is in office, the Buckhead City push appears to be on the backburner for at least several years. If the BCC adheres to its latest announcement, it seems unlikely any lawmakers will take up the cause with its strongest proponents seemingly unwilling to continue the fight until 2027. However, much remains to be seen how Dickens’ administration and the Atlanta City Council will address issues raised by the BCC over the coming years. Additionally, the BCC will still need to field support from lawmakers to sponsor any future cityhood bills, and there is the potential for a complete turnover of local representation over the next several years.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Buckhead Cityhood's failings\nBuckhead cityhood is a part of 'old Atlanta' we should leave behind\nWelcome to my freemium newsletter by me, King Williams. A documentary filmmaker, journalist, podcast host, and author based in Atlanta, Georgia. This is a newsletter covering the hidden connections of Atlanta to everything else.\nWomen’s History Month events:\nNathalie Stutzmann will lead the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra on 3/23 and 3/25\n1. Buckhead Cityhood is dead, again\nBuckhead Cityhood is finally put to rest. The three-year ordeal to secede Buckhead, the most affluent area of Atlanta from the city proper is now over according to the Buckhead Cityhood Committee in an email sent to its supporters.\nThe idea of Buckhead Cityhood was given a huge push forward last week, only to crash on full public display. This week saw the surprise of two Republican-proposed bills aimed at cityhood, Senate Bills 113 and 114 both passing in a senate subcommittee meeting. The two bills were passed along party lines (4R vs 3D) giving a jolt to the possibility of cityhood for Buckhead. But after last week’s full State Senate vote, the idea is dead, again—well at least for now. So what happened?\n2. What is Buckhead?\nTL/DR: Buckhead is the northern portion of the city of Atlanta.\nOriginally annexed into the city of Atlanta in 1952 as an effort to stave off the then-growing Black population in Atlanta. Prior to annexation, this area was home to a post-farmland economic center transitioning into a then-modern wealthy suburban enclave of Atlanta’s white movers and shakers. It also had a sizeable Black population that was removed systematically in the 1940s and 1950s. That removal also laid the grounds for what would be the future commercial districts of Buckhead that are known today.\nIn the process of transition, many of the farms were sold, while many of the Black residents were forced out. In addition, the land became home to a growing base of wealthier Atlantans who were moving further northward. A population that grew in part from the white flight era of Atlanta from the 1940s-1970s. As a result, Buckhead for nearly 70 years has been the hallmark of wealth in the city. Buckhead and its business community have enjoyed maintaining a large influence on dictating what does and doesn’t happen in the city. But in the last 25 years, the area has grown more politically diverse than in years past and is becoming more racially diverse as well.\n3. How did we get to Buckhead secession?\nTL/DR: White flight, 2020, a series of successful Cityhood movements across the metro Atlanta area and a rise in notable crimes, mainly shootings in the area.\nBackground: Buckhead has always had a tenuous relationship with Atlanta leadership. The attempted secession is the most extreme case in a decades-long relationship of Atlanta’s racial and socio-political history.\nLt. Governor Burt Jones and eight state republicans also are how we got to cityhood 2.0\nHow cityhood made it to a vote this year is due to the legislative shepherding of newly elected, Lt. Governor Burt Jones. Jones, a 2020 election denier and one of 16 Georgia Republicans who signed on to be a fake elector for President Trump’s attempted coup in 2020. Jones was also one of the initial Buckhead cityhood bill sponsors last year.\nSince the first defeat of the cityhood effort last year by then-Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan, it seemed as if Buckhead cityhood was dead. Fast forward a few months, after one of the bill’s key sponsors, Jones defeated Charlie Bailey for Geoff Duncan’s position, cityhood was back on the table. This time with a new set of state lawmakers to take on sponsoring the effort, manifesting in SB 113 and SB114. But unlike in 2022, Georgia’s newly elected Lt. Governor would not kill this bill, leading to the progress cityhood made until last Thursday’s vote.\n4. How did Buckhead get so much clout in the first place?\nTL/DR: White flight. White flight in Atlanta began in the 1940s and lasted until the early 1980s.\nWhite flight in Atlanta was a four-decade redistribution of residents and wealth from within the racially segregated white neighborhoods of Atlanta to the north side of the city, Buckhead, and the newly created suburbs. This was a result of desegregation, integration, and the backlash to the civil rights movement. Atlanta was no different.\nFrom my previous newsletter: White Flight in Atlanta and The New Voting Power in Georgia - 12/18/2020\nAs whites abandoned the city of Atlanta, the ethos of many of its suburban developments were to provide a newer safe haven of self-segregation. Segregation of jobs, financial institutions, public spaces, retail, housing, and other notions of American prosperity. For many whites throughout the 1950s, the notion of federal legal and armed mandates of ‘forced integration’ represented a bridge too far in ‘personal’ freedoms and the fallacy of ‘states rights’. The suburbs represented a kinder, more racially coded, and often gated community, free from the problems of the city white residents purposely caused.\nThese problems included purposely defunding the city government via the tax revolts of the 1950s/60s, alongside closing down public recreation centers, and removal of white children from public schools due to the announcement of integration, to name a few. Although, in the case of Peyton Road, building an actual blockade to keep African Americans out of their neighborhood of Cascade Heights in 1962. After the subsequent pushback, white Atlantans completely abandoned the Westside of Atlanta for the racially segregated Cobb County.\nThe city was already experiencing an exodus of White Atlantans from the city into the newly developing suburbs in Cobb, North Fulton, and Gwinnett counties, while also moving further eastward into neighboring DeKalb County.\nThe city’s white flight-related losses were Buckhead’s gain\nThe compound effects of white flight aided in decelerating the city of Atlanta’s overall population, infrastructure, schools, and budgetary needs. On top of an overall decline in the city’s non-Buckhead located commercial and residential markets. This quickly evolved into challenges on resource allocation, education, taxes, policing, and economic development. Decades later, Buckhead now operates as a quasi-financial hub, regional retail center, and tourism district outside of downtown proper, atypical for most US cities.\nThe 1973 Atlanta mayors race\nThe 1973 Mayors race between incumbent Sam Massell, Atlanta’s first and only Jewish mayor (as well as its last white mayor), and Maynard Jackson would become a representative of how race relations and political power operate in Atlanta.\nFrom my previous newsletter: RIP Mayor Sam Massell - 3/15/2022 — Re-election loss and the election of Maynard Jackson\nThat election would eventually see Jackson upset Massell to become Atlanta’s first Black mayor. That election was noticeable for the dog-whistle politics that emerged from Massell’s campaign. A sharp departure from the campaign that was presented four years prior. The most well-known slogan during the election, ‘Atlanta’s Too Young to Die’ was a direct reference to the idea of Maynard Jackson, being Atlanta’s first Black Mayor. The ad reflected the attitudes at the time overlapping a shift in attitudes towards Black political leadership and the peak of white flight from Atlanta in the 1970s. Massell in defeat did not stay away from remaining a political figure, as his proceeding third act of his life would see his merging of his entreprenuership and his city hall experience lend him to become ‘The Mayor of Buckhead’.\nMassell’s use of the slogan “Atlanta’s too young to die” while stumping on the campaign was a softer dog whistle to those concerned that Maynard Jackson, the grandson of ‘the Mayor of Auburn Avenue’ John Wesley Dobbs, would drag Atlanta down. The resentment politics of that phrase and Jackson’s ascension foreshadowed the role of race and the mayor’s office would have in Atlanta over the presiding years.\n‘The Mayor of Buckhead’\nJackson would eventually win the election, becoming Atlanta’s first Black mayor and Massell would then retreat back to Buckhead, eventually becoming the de facto leader of the area as he was colloquially called ‘the mayor of Buckhead’. Massell, while not holding an officially recognized position, has been a liaison between the official leadership and those with interests in Buckhead. Over the years, the area, its residents, and businesses have only grown in prominence with Massell acting as a major factor in many of those endeavors.\nFrom my previous newsletter: RIP Mayor Sam Massell - 3/15/2022 —\nThe post-political career of Massell saw him continue to be a force in Atlanta politics. Massell served on the Board of MARTA, as well as was a member of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG). Massell also became a key supporter in the eventual election of Shirley Franklin in 2001…\n…Massell also used his political heft to aid in the creation of Georgia 400, a then-toll road connecting Buckhead to the northern suburbs. His biggest impact post-mayor being the founding of the Buckhead Coalition, arguably the most impactful civic organization in the city’s history…\n...Under the guidance of the Buckhead Coalition, the smaller economic development arm, the Buckhead Community Improvement District (Buckhead CID) that was spun off into a separate, successful organization.\nMassell prior to his death in March of 2022, was an ardent critic of the idea of Buckhead Cityhood and used his position to lobby behind the scenes to stop it.\n5. Sandy Springs and other cityhood movements\nTL/DR: The entire metro Atlanta cityhood movement began with Sandy Springs.\nThe incorporation of Sandy Springs in 2005 is the start of the modern Cityhood movement. Since the arrival of Sandy Springs, several other cityhood initiatives including the 2006 incorporation of the cities of Milton and Johns Creek in North Fulton, as well as the 2012 incorporation of Brookhaven; all of which were mostly white, mostly conservative, and Republican-led efforts have passed. Sandy Springs’s effort to self-segregate the northern suburban enclave began in the 1960s before a series of legal and political challenges finally allowed for its 2005 referendum. In that special election, the majority of voters chose cityhood.\nVia The New York Times: A Georgia Town Takes the People’s Business Private - 6/23/12\nDoes the Sandy Springs approach work? It does for Sandy Springs, says the city manager, John F. McDonough, who points not only to the town’s healthy balance sheet but also to high marks from residents on surveys about quality of life and quality of government services.\nBut that doesn’t mean “the model” can be easily exported — Sandy Springs has the built-in advantage that comes from wealth — or that its widespread adoption would enhance the commonweal. Critics contend that the town is a white-flight suburb that has essentially seceded from Fulton County, a 70-mile-long stretch that includes many poor and largely African-American areas, most of them in Atlanta and points south.\nThe veiled racism of Sandy Springs incorporation\nSandy Springs residents were some of the most vocal about their tax dollars being spent on other places within Fulton County. Sandy Springs, like the other initiatives, focused on the role of taxation being spent countywide versus within their localities. Sandy Springs and Brookhaven, both expressed issues regarding the need for a higher level of street-level policing and patrolling that were alleged to be not addressed by Fulton and DeKalb County respectively. When directly asked about the concerns of the removal of tax funds to the broader, blacker counties at large were dismissed.\nOliver Porter, leader of Sandy Springs privatization\nThe leader of that movement Oliver Porter, “Creating the New City of Sandy Springs.” Sandy Springs’s incorporation was unique in that it attempted to outsource nearly all of its services. Based on the libertarian principles of free enterprise being better at the administration of government-related duties versus the actual government.\nIn time, the need for a centralized managed city government won over the private market. Within a few years after opening, there were attempts to expand city government to meet the needs and save costs. By 2019, the city ended up saving money by having government-ran facilities. The private market price gouging and misreads of the market led to a reevaluation of the initial strategy. Cityhood cost Sandy Springs more than expected.\nWhile Porter has decided to take his cause to Latin America, a place being inundated with new entrants of American free-market gospel and conservative culture warriors of recent. Porter’s newest initiative, Próspera, hopes to now create a free-market city-state in Honduras. Even that initiative is facing some pushback from locals.\nThe other costs of the privatization of Sandy Springs\nIn the end, Sandy Springs had to raise taxes (several times), expand its local government, and provide some government-managed services to citizens, eschewing the private market options. While early supporters of the free market lost out, the main concerns of ‘wasteful government spending’ and allocation of their tax dollars to ‘undeserving’ South Fulton have mostly gone away, mostly.\nThe Sandy Springs residents of 2023 are okay with these changes. The city keeps growing, becoming more diverse, and is taking a slow move towards a suburban urbanist retrofit in some parts.\nThe other post-Sandy Springs successful cityhood movements\nSince the incorporation of Sandy Springs, several other municipalities have successfully created their own enclaves. DeKalb County has had three, Brookhaven in 2012, alongside both Tucker and Stonecrest in 2016. The city of South Fulton in 2017. In November of 2022, the city of Mableton became the most recent member of the cityhood club. Mableton, despite being voted on in November is already facing succession efforts from those who wish not to be a part of the newly created city.\nBut cityhood doesn’t always work.\nLast year saw three different cityhood efforts fail in Cobb County, all in traditionally Republican-leaning districts. The cityhood effort closest to the Buckhead cityhood scenario, the ill-fated City of Eagles Landing in Henry County also failed. That initiative was similar to Buckhead in that it would’ve meant annexing part of the already existing city of Stockbridge’s wealthiest parts and its most successful commercial district to create a new city.\nWhile a new initiative, the city of DeKalb, a 200,000 plan encompassing most of unincorporated South DeKalb County faces an uphill climb. A climb based on a previously failed effort, the city of Greenhaven in the early-mid 2010s. Alongside a possibility that A) the residents reject the effort, deciding to stay unincorporated or B) the same proposed section of South DeKalb could be annexed into the city of Atlanta proper, opening the doors for millions more in federal funding.\n6. The problems with Buckhead cityhood\nTL/DR: The City of Buckhead City’s dollars made no sense.\nUnlike recent cityhood initiatives in metro Atlanta, Buckhead Cityhood would’ve undone decades of state law, setting a precedent that may not work out long-term for cityhood supporters. This was in addition to a series of related problems that couldn’t be easily parsed in a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ vote.\nFrom my 2/14 newsletter: Buckhead cityhood pt.2…\nThe problems with Buckhead cityhood:\nTo do this would require the city to de-annex from the City of Atlanta, after being annexed into the city in 1952.\nDoing this would also require a series of separate agreements on key infrastructure items such as sewage, water, road repairs, 911 dispatch, schools, properties owned by the city of Atlanta\nThis would also affect the credit rating of the city of Atlanta and Buckhead City, making the overall state of Georgia’s credit rating potentially at risk\nThis also requires a change to existing state laws regarding local municipalities engaging in annexing, de-annexing, and acquiring new and/or existing land\nThe Buckhead cityhood push is still unclear on key funding mechanisms for its city separation and has not engaged in any series of non-affiliated economic feasibility studies.\nProblem #1: The city of Buckhead City would’ve set up a scenario that would undo the fabric of local governments throughout the state.\nTo make the City of Buckhead City would mean changing state law to do so. If the city of Buckhead City were to exist then it would open the door for any city to petition to annex or de-annex any potentially valuable asset from any municipality.\nProblem #2: The dollars didn’t make any sense.\nThe biggest issue of Buckhead cityhood would be the costs of secession on the city and the newly created city. The $3 billion in bonds already issued to cover Atlanta’s infrastructure and other needs could not easily be settled through a separation.\nAdditionally, the announced plan to take several key parcels for literal pennies on the dollar was a non-starter. For example, writing into law that Atlanta-owned parkland could’ve been sold for $100 an acre, would make Chastain Park, arguably located in the wealthiest part of the city, with its current market rate of $1,000,000+ an acre an actual case for land theft. Or where a fire station, which typically goes for at least $ 10-15 million per building, would be sold for $5,000 dollars under those terms.\nProblem #3: The infrastructure can’t be separated.\nIf the City of Buckhead City were to actually happen, it wouldn’t be a physical separation from Atlanta, just a legal one.\nThe water and sewage are one system. The Beltline which cuts through Buckhead is a city of Atlanta park. In addition, the other private market utilities such as gas and electricity are now subject to new agreements with Buckhead City.\nAn additional plan would be needed for how to use 911 and emergency management services were not factored into the Buckhead city plan. Service would have to either be contracted out or a new system would have to be created altogether. A problem that still happens in the triangle of Atlanta-DeKalb County-Fulton County already.\nThe roads that intersect Buckhead and the city of Atlanta are interconnected. The issue of who will cover the various roadways would require either a GDOT model of a contractor-based system (likely with the same cronyism attached) or to create its own department. The city would also likely have to contract the city of Atlanta or Fulton County for these services.\nProblem #4: Becoming a separate city doesn’t stop crime.\nAn ongoing point in the cityhood debate was the fact that separating from the city of Atlanta would not stop crime.\nBuckhead is still the safest part of the city. As it was in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Buckhead already has two police precincts, and recently added a third as soon as Mayor Dickens took office. The area also has more allocated offers for patrols in the area. Should Dickens reach his goal of 2,000 officers (APD is at roughly 1,500), including a goal of swearing in 250 new officers in his first year in office. Atlanta could allocate hundreds more to Buckhead.\nThe proposed Buckhead City would have 250 police officers for the area. 250 officers who would need to have better pay than the starting salaries of Atlanta’s $48,500, Brookhaven’s $48,500, Milton’s $53,893, and Sandy Springs’s $56,672,\nThose officers in theory would protect the area from street-level crimes. But considering most crimes happen with some familiarity and also often in unplanned situations, it’s not likely to stop every type of crime.\nFor private buildings, apartments, condos, and other dwellings, it’s on the owner, not the police to protect those areas. Police can and do show up to private businesses upon reasonable requests, it’s not a guarantee it will stop everything.\nProblem #5: There were no tangible plans for schools\nThe issue of who gets Buckhead’s public schools was always under scrutiny. Many of APS’s highest-performing and most well-resourced schools are located in Buckhead, offering an alternative to the myriad of private schools in the area.\nBuckhead City’s proposed plan would’ve seen several schools put up for either being sold for pennies on the dollar at $1,000 per building. With the proposal to place all remaining Atlanta Public Schools into the Fulton County Public School System.\nProblem #6: The plan was supported by Buckhead Republicans, not Buckhead Democrats\nAccording to a 2021 survey, the biggest supporters of Buckhead cityhood were Republicans, not Democrats. Considering the area is 3/5ths Democrat supporting (and trending upward), there was already an uphill battle against the cityhood initiative.\nProblem #7: The city of Buckhead City couldn’t grow out, only up\nBuckhead had one additional problem, the land presented very limited pockets for future development. Buckhead despite its reputation is mostly covered by low-density residential neighborhoods, strip malls, and retail.\nCities typically have to annex territory to meet future needs of infrastructure, residential, and commercial development. For Buckhead City to be feasible in the long term, the only option would be to move northwest into the Cobb-Atlanta territory to access new land. A likely legal challenge from both Cobb, Fulton, and/or the City of Atlanta would also emerge on those disputed portions of land.\nBuckhead’s most viable spots are already covered with existing development. Despite a recent uptick in new development, there is a possibility that the city could reach peak population soon unless newer, denser housing options are added.\nProblem #8: The city of Buckhead City would have to compete with other cities\nIf the city of Buckhead City were to be its own city, it would be competing with neighboring Midtown Atlanta, Sandy Springs, Roswell, and East Cobb.\nSince 2000, the northern suburbs and their anchoring cities have grown and become increasingly competitive. In East Cobb, there was an attempt at cityhood last year. While the anchoring Cumberland District is now adjourning The Battery Atlanta, the mixed-use district for the Atlanta Braves. Brookhaven, the closest city outside of the city limits (literally next door) has managed to attract would-be Buckhead families.\nBoth Chamblee and Doraville are undergoing several massive new projects aimed at the same potential consumers and residents as Sandy Springs, Brookhaven, and Buckhead. While nearby Dunwoody-Perimeter, already a hallmark of suburban development has plans to get even more economic development to the area.\nWhile the biggest threat to Buckhead City would be Midtown. Midtown is the densest portion of the city, with more shovel-ready properties and newer potential projects that would undercut plans for Buckhead. Midtown has already been the capital of new commercial and residential development in the 2010s. Given its position, Midtown would stand to benefit the most of those not wanting to be in Buckhead City proper.\nProblem #9: The big business community leadership wanted to stay in the union\nThe Buckhead business coalition and other prominent members of the business community came out in unison against the idea. Bill White and the cityhood supporters couldn’t win over the business community, ultimately leaving it without a crucial leg to stand on. The potential of newer and higher taxes plus the ancillary effects of the financial problems that come with two new cities was too much to bear.\nProblem #10: The same plans to de-annex Buckhead could’ve been used against cityhood\nBuckhead City’s greatest folly was assuming that a supermajority of residents and businesses wanted to separate from Atlanta. Buckhead residents who didn’t want to be a part of Buckhead City could petition, then vote out of the city. They could rejoin the union, join neighboring Sandy Springs, or become a city on their own. Putting Buckhead City in the potential same financial problems as the city of Atlanta.\n7. Buckhead City wasn’t going to be a Republican-led city\nTL/DR: Creating the richest city in Georgia full of Democrats would’ve been a mistake\nThe other problem with Buckhead City, it would be a Democrat-run city. Despite the leadership of Bill White and its supporters, the trend of Buckhead is getting bluer.\nThe city of Buckhead City would be ‘blue’ not ‘red’ much to the cityhood supporters’ chagrin. The biggest issue as one Republican lawmaker, State Sen. John Albers stated was that Buckhead City would be a Democrat-run city.\nBuckhead is Democrat-leaning, which doesn’t always equate to liberal\nBuckhead residents didn’t believe in the dog whistle politics of Bill White nor the out-of-district lawmakers sponsoring the bill. But they do represent an Atlanta that wants similar goals. Buckhead would be a return to the heyday of the 1980s and 1990s style of conservative Democratic politics. A politick that overlaps with typical points of support from conservative Republicans but with a greater emphasis on the civil rights and personal protections of the Democratic Party.\nVia The Saporta Report: A blue Buckhead is cityhood’s overlooked challenge - 2/14/2022\nElection Day brought more bad news for the Buckhead cityhood movement, as its endorsed local candidates all lost and the neighborhood continued voting blue in major races…\n…The Buckhead City Committee (BCC), the group advocating cityhood, endorsed five local candidates — all Republicans who lost to Democrats. Among them were BCC President Sam Lenaeus, defeated in Georgia House District 55 by Igna Willis, and Christian Zimm, the group’s communications VP, who lost an impossible challenge to 5th District Congresswoman Nikema Williams, the chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia…\n…In ticket-topping races, Buckhead continued to vote reliably blue. Democrat Stacey Abrams, as she did in 2018, again beat Republican Brian Kemp in Buckhead’s vote for governor, this time with 52.3 percent. Democrat Raphael Warnock, the incumbent U.S. senator, trounced Republican challenger Herschel Walker in the neighborhood, 61 percent to 36.8 percent.\nContinued…\nSplit-ticket voting or ballot-blanking were evident in Buckhead’s Republican-heavy western areas with Trumpian politics apparently continuing to be a factor.\nThis is a Democratic base (center, center-left), not a liberal or progressive one. Buckhead residents support law and order policing, support ‘Cop City’, support the upcoming redevelopment of the Fulton County Jail, and believe the uptick in crime is necessary to address those issues, even if by unpopular means.\n8 . What is the future of Buckhead? Atlanta?\nTL/DR: Despite the second defeat of cityhood, Atlanta is still in unfamiliar territory\nFor Buckhead, enjoy the next 12 months, everything is in play for their needs. 2024 is too risky to project the political climate.\nBuckhead can win by having a trifecta of state-level GOP supporters including the Governor to get needs met, a city council that has zero leverage currently, and a direct connection to the Biden administration. Now is the time for another Sam Massell-like figure who can interweave all of these advantages while the window is open. Who that person is (if one ever emerges) has yet to be seen.\nFor Atlanta, it’s less clear.\nThe union stays together…it may even expand! Buckhead gets even more power than it has ever had, but the marketplace is different now. This current city council has been relatively successful in hearing new ideas, moving fast at addressing issues, and a mix of members that is closer to the makeup of the varying factions of Atlanta.\nBut due to the issues of the continued perceptions of lawlessness and a rise in crime, all of these gains are not being heard by the average resident. If Atlanta wants to level up from a tier 3/4-city to a solid 2, it’s got to manage its reputation better. Cop City, crime, and cityhood are all seriously holding it back.\nFor Mayor Dickens, he has to continue to be a poker player.\nDickens must continue to keep his long-term plans and dealings closer to the chest. He has to continue to several disparate groups all wanting different things. APD/APDF’s ‘Cop City’ plans Buckhead’s policing needs, his own affordable housing goals, Atlanta Housing’s public housing redevelopment plans, and how to address homelessness while playing nice with Kemp and state GOP. Dickens’s played both the Cop City and Buckhead Cityhood plans correctly, he’s going to need to keep that going for the next two years before his re-election in 2025.\nDickens's other issue of how to keep the prosperity bomb of development in Atlanta without ticking off its stakeholders. A prosperity bomb that started under former mayor Kasim Reed but is now facing an issue of continuing Atlanta’s penchant for sweetheart deals for more steadfast leadership. That could mean ending cheap land deals, taxing premium property owners including corporations—the same groups who backed Cop City but pushed against Buckhead cityhood.\nFor Bill White, it’s likely he goes back to fundraising or continues to cash in on his growing national fame.\n2024 looks to be a record haul for the GOP as Ron DeSantis, the presumed GOP nominee for president has already started fundraising. Trump is also running again in 2024, giving some opportunity to potentially work on both efforts in some capacity. Bill White will be back.\nFor Buckhead Cityhood supporters, Cityhood could still be back, albeit with a longer timetable.\nFor reference, the cityhood effort that started this all, Sandy Springs had its own efforts take nearly 40 years to complete. Despite this current defeat, there is still the possibility that in a later term, this could happen again. Maybe after Kemp leaves in 2026 especially if it’s a Trump-like Burt Jones who becomes the next governor. Republicans are always playing chess, while the Dems play checkers.\nThe likelier strategy is to let this sit on the back burner until 1) Burt Jones runs for re-election, as Lt. Governor in 2026, 2) Jones (or another cityhood supporter) becomes Governor, 3) the cityhood supporters get more Republicans in either the state House or the Senate to again vote on it in the future, 4) potentially launch court battles circumventing the state, and 5) all of the above.\nNext: How Buckhead Cityhood birthed ‘Cop City’\nBuckhead Cityhood is making fewer dollars and even less sense.\n-KJW\nThank you for the insightful and well researched article.

It is the county seat of Fulton County and extends into neighboring DeKalb County. With a population of 498,715 at the 2020 census and an estimated 520,070 in 2024, Atlanta is the eighth-most populous city in the Southeast and the 36th-most populous city in the United States.[16] Atlanta is classified as a Beta+ global city. The Atlanta metropolitan area has an estimated population of over 6.4 million and is the eighth-largest metropolitan area in the United States.[17] Situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains at an elevation of just over 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea level, Atlanta features a unique topography that includes rolling hills, lush greenery, and the densest urban tree coverage of any major city in the United States.[18]\nAtlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad, but soon became the convergence point for several railroad lines, spurring its rapid growth. The largest of these was the Western and Atlantic Railroad, from which the name \"Atlanta\" is derived, reflecting the city's growing reputation as a major transportation hub.[19] During the American Civil War, the city served a strategically important role for the Confederacy until it was captured in 1864. Atlanta was almost entirely burned to the ground during General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea. However, it rebounded dramatically in the post-war period and quickly became a national industrial center and the unofficial capital of the \"New South\". After World War II, Atlanta emerged as a manufacturing and technology hub.[20] During the 1950s and 1960s, it became a major organizing center of the American civil rights movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, and many other locals serving as prominent leaders.[21] In the modern era, Atlanta has remained a major transportation center, with Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport becoming the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic in 1998. It has maintained this position every year since, except in 2020, with an estimated 93.7 million passengers in 2022.[22][23][24]\nWith a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $473 billion in 2021, Atlanta has the 11th-largest economy among U.S. cities and the 22nd-largest in the world.[25] Its economy is diverse, with dominant sectors including transportation, aerospace, logistics, healthcare, news and media operations, film and television production, information technology, finance, biomedical research, and public policy. Atlanta established itself on the world stage when it won the bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics. The Games had a lasting impact on Atlanta's development into the 21st century, leading to significant investment in the city's universities, parks, and tourism industry.[26] The gentrification of some of its neighborhoods has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline, altering Atlanta's demographics, politics, aesthetics, and culture.[27][28][29]\nHistory\nNative American settlements\nFor thousands of years prior to the arrival of European settlers in North Georgia, the indigenous Creek people, Cherokee people, and their ancestors inhabited the area.[30] Standing Peachtree, a Creek village where Peachtree Creek flows into the Chattahoochee River, was the closest Native American settlement to what is now Atlanta.[31] Through the early 19th century, European Americans systematically encroached on the Creek of northern Georgia, forcing them out of the area from 1802 to 1825.[32] The Creek were forced to leave the area in 1821, under Indian Removal by the federal government, and European American settlers arrived the following year.[33]\nWestern and Atlantic Railroad\nIn 1836, the Georgia General Assembly voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad in order to provide a link between the port of Savannah and the Midwest.[34] The initial route was to run southward from Chattanooga to a terminus east of the Chattahoochee River, which would be linked to Savannah. After engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus, the \"zero milepost\" was driven into the ground in what is now Foundry Street, Five Points. When asked in 1837 about the future of the little village, Stephen Harriman Long, the railroad's chief engineer said the place would be good \"for one tavern, a blacksmith shop, a grocery store, and nothing else\".[35] A year later, the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as Terminus, and later Thrasherville, after a local merchant who built homes and a general store in the area.[36] By 1842, the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed Marthasville to honor Governor Wilson Lumpkin's daughter Martha. Later, John Edgar Thomson, Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad, suggested the town be renamed Atlanta, supposedly a feminine version of the word \"Atlantic\", referring to the Western and Atlantic Railroad.[19] (Atalanta was also Martha Lumpkin's middle name.) The residents approved, and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 29, 1847.[37]\nAmerican Civil War\nBy 1860, Atlanta's population had grown to 9,554.[38][39] During the American Civil War, the nexus of multiple railroads in Atlanta made the city a strategic hub for the distribution of military supplies.[40]\nIn 1864, the Union Army moved southward following the capture of Chattanooga and began its invasion of north Georgia. The region surrounding Atlanta was the location of several major army battles, culminating with the Battle of Atlanta and a four-month-long siege of the city by the Union Army under the command of General William Tecumseh Sherman. On September 1, 1864, Confederate General John Bell Hood decided to retreat from Atlanta, and he ordered the destruction of all public buildings and possible assets that could be of use to the Union Army. On the next day, Mayor James Calhoun surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, and on September 7, Sherman ordered the city's civilian population to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, Sherman prepared for the Union Army's March to the Sea by ordering the destruction of Atlanta's remaining military assets.[41]\nReconstruction and late 19th century\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt during the Reconstruction era. The work attracted many new residents. Due to the city's superior rail transportation network, the state capital was moved from Milledgeville to Atlanta in 1868.[42] In the 1880 Census, Atlanta had surpassed Savannah as Georgia's largest city.[43]\nBeginning in the 1880s, Henry W. Grady, the editor of the Atlanta Constitution newspaper, promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the \"New South\" that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. By 1885, the founding of the Georgia School of Technology (now the Georgia Institute of Technology) and the Atlanta University Center, a consortium of historically black colleges made up of units for men and women, had established Atlanta as a center for higher education. In 1895, Atlanta hosted the Cotton States and International Exposition, which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the New South's development to the world.[44]\n20th century\nDuring the first decades of the 20th century, Atlanta enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth. In three decades' time, Atlanta's population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs. The city's skyline grew taller with the construction of the Equitable, Flatiron, Empire, and Candler buildings. Sweet Auburn emerged as a center of Black commerce. The period was also marked by strife and tragedy. Increased racial tensions led to the Atlanta Race Riot of 1906, when Whites attacked Blacks, leaving at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured, with extensive damage in Black neighborhoods. In 1913, Leo Frank, a Jewish-American factory superintendent, was convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old girl in a highly publicized trial. He was sentenced to death, but the governor commuted his sentence to life. An enraged and organized lynch mob took him from jail in 1915 and hanged him in Marietta. The Jewish community in Atlanta and across the country were horrified.[45][46] On May 21, 1917, the Great Atlanta Fire destroyed 1,938 buildings in what is now the Old Fourth Ward, resulting in one fatality and the displacement of 10,000 people.[19]\nOn December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the premiere of Gone with the Wind, the epic film based on the best-selling novel by Atlanta's Margaret Mitchell. The gala event at Loew's Grand Theatre was attended by the film's legendary producer, David O. Selznick, and the film's stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, and Olivia de Havilland, but Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel, an African-American actress, was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws.[47]\nAtlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during World War II. Colonel Blake Van Leer, the president of Georgia Tech, played a significant part by lobbying war-related manufacturing companies like Lockheed Martin to move to Atlanta, successfully lobbying the Government to build military bases, in turn helping attract thousands of new residents through new jobs. Van Leer also launched major research centers, which included Neely Nuclear Research Center and funds to help make Georgia Tech the \"MIT\" of the south while also founding Southern Polytechnic State University.[48][49][50]\nThese new defense industries attracted thousands of new residents and generated revenues, resulting in rapid population and economic growth. In the 1950s, the city's newly constructed highway system, supported by federal subsidies, allowed middle class Atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs. As a result, the city began to make up an ever-smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's population.[19]\nCivil rights movement\nAfrican-American veterans returned from World War II seeking full rights in their country and began heightened activism. In exchange for support by that portion of the Black community that could vote, in 1948 the mayor ordered the hiring of the first eight African-American police officers in the city.[51]\nMuch controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl, when the Pitt Panthers, with African-American fullback Bobby Grier on the roster, met the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.[52] There had been controversy over whether Grier should be allowed to play due to his race, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia's Governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to racial integration.[53][54][55] After Griffin publicly sent a telegram to the state's Board of Regents requesting Georgia Tech not to engage in racially integrated events, Georgia Tech's president Blake R. Van Leer rejected the request and threatened to resign. Later, students from both Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia held a protest against Griffin's stance, which soon turned into a riot. The students broke windows, upturned parking meters, hung Griffin in effigy, and marched all the way to the governor's mansion, surrounding it until 3:30 a.m. Griffin publicly blamed Georgia Tech's president for the \"riots\" and requested he be replaced and Georgia Tech's state funding be cut off. On December 5 the Georgia Tech board of regents voted 13–1 in favor of allowing the game to proceed as scheduled.[56]\nIn the 1960s, Atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, and students from Atlanta's historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement's leadership. While Atlanta in the postwar years had relatively minimal racial strife compared to other cities, Blacks were limited by discrimination, segregation, and continued disenfranchisement of most voters.[57] In 1961, the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by realtors by erecting road barriers in Cascade Heights, countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the \"city too busy to hate.\"[57][58]\nDesegregation of the public sphere came in stages, with public transportation desegregated by 1959,[59] the restaurant at Rich's department store by 1961,[60] movie theaters by 1963,[61] and public schools by 1973 (nearly 20 years after the US Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional).[62]\nIn 1960, Whites comprised 61.7% of the city's population.[63] During the 1950s–70s, suburbanization and White flight from urban areas led to a significant demographic shift.[57] By 1970, African Americans were the majority of the city's population and exercised their recently enforced voting rights and political influence by electing Atlanta's first Black mayor, Maynard Jackson, in 1973. Under Mayor Jackson's tenure, Atlanta's airport was modernized, strengthening the city's role as a transportation center. The opening of the Georgia World Congress Center in 1976 further confirmed Atlanta's rise as a convention city.[64] Construction of the city's subway system began in 1975, with rail service commencing in 1979.[65] Despite these improvements, Atlanta lost more than 100,000 residents between 1970 and 1990, over 20% of its population.[66] At the same time, it developed new office space after attracting numerous corporations, with an increasing portion of workers from northern areas.[67]\n1996 Summer Olympic games\nAtlanta was selected as the site for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. Following the announcement, the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve Atlanta's parks, sporting venues, and transportation infrastructure; however, for the first time, none of the $1.7 billion cost of the games was governmentally funded. While the games experienced transportation and accommodation problems and the Centennial Olympic Park bombing occurred despite extra security precautions,[68] the spectacle was still a watershed event in Atlanta's history. According to former Mayor Kasim Reed, the Olympic Games generated \"a direct economic impact of at least USD 5 billion\".[69][70] For the first time in Olympic history, every one of the record 197 national Olympic committees invited to compete sent athletes, sending more than 10,000 contestants participating in a record 271 events. The related projects such as Atlanta's Olympic Legacy Program and civic effort initiated a fundamental transformation of the city in the following decade.[66]\n21st century\nDuring the 2000s, the city of Atlanta underwent a profound physical, cultural, and demographic change. As some of the African-American middle and upper classes also began to move to the suburbs, a booming economy drew numerous new migrants from other cities in the United States, who contributed to changes in the city's demographics. African Americans made up a decreasing portion of the population, from a high of 67% in 1990 to 54% in 2010.[71] From 2000 to 2010, Atlanta gained 22,763 white residents, 5,142 Asian residents, and 3,095 Hispanic residents, while the city's Black population decreased by 31,678.[72][73] Much of the city's demographic change during the decade was driven by young, college-educated professionals: from 2000 to 2009, the three-mile radius surrounding Downtown Atlanta gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 and holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61%.[74] This was similar to the tendency in other cities for young, college educated, single or married couples to live in downtown areas.[75]\nIn the lead-up to the 1996 Summer Olympics, the Atlanta Housing Authority demolished nearly all of its public housing.[76][77][78] Residents instead received vouchers to pay for private housing; a wave of mixed housing was built using funding from the HOPE VI program under CEO Renee Lewis Glover (1994–2013).[79]\nIn 2005, the city approved the $2.8 billion BeltLine project. It was intended to convert a disused 22-mile freight railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art-filled multi-use trail and light rail transit line, which would increase the city's park space by 40%.[80] The project stimulated retail and residential development along the loop, but has been criticized for its adverse effects on some Black communities.[81] In 2013, the project received a federal grant of $18 million to develop the southwest corridor. In September 2019, the James M. Cox Foundation gave $6 million to the PATH Foundation which will connect the Silver Comet Trail to The Atlanta BeltLine, which was expected to be completed by 2022. Upon completion, the total combined interconnected trail distance around Atlanta for the Atlanta BeltLine and Silver Comet Trail will be the longest paved trail surface in the U.S., totaling about 300 miles (480 km).[80]\nAtlanta's cultural offerings expanded during the 2000s: the High Museum of Art doubled in size; the Alliance Theatre won a Tony Award; and art galleries were established on the once-industrial Westside.[82] The College Football Hall of Fame relocated to Atlanta and the National Center for Civil and Human Rights museum was constructed. The city of Atlanta was the subject of a massive cyberattack which began in March 2018.[83] In December 2019, Atlanta hosted the Miss Universe 2019 pageant competition.[84][85][86] On June 16, 2022, Atlanta was selected as a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[87]\nGeography\nAtlanta encompasses 134.0 square miles (347.1 km2), of which 133.2 square miles (344.9 km2) is land and 0.85 square miles (2.2 km2) is water.[88] The city is situated in the Deep South of the southeastern United States among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. At 1,050 feet (320 m) above mean sea level, Atlanta has the highest elevation among major cities east of the Mississippi River.[89] Atlanta straddles the Eastern Continental Divide. Rainwater that falls on the south and east side of the divide flows into the Atlantic Ocean, while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide flows into the Gulf of Mexico.[90] Atlanta developed on a ridge south of the Chattahoochee River, which is part of the ACF River Basin. The river borders the far northwestern edge of the city, and much of its natural habitat has been preserved, in part by the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area.[91]\nAtlanta is 21 miles (34 km) southeast of Marietta,[92] 27 miles (43 km) southwest of Alpharetta, 146 miles (235 km) southwest of Greenville, South Carolina,[93] 147 miles (237 km) east of Birmingham, Alabama,[94] and 245 miles (394 km) southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina.[95]\nDespite having lost significant tree canopy coverage between 1973 and 1999, Atlanta now has the densest urban tree coverage of any major city in the United States and is often called \"City of Trees\" or \"The City in a Forest\".[18][96][97][98]\nCityscape\nNeighborhoods\nAtlanta is divided into 242 officially defined neighborhoods.[99] The city contains three major high-rise districts, which form a north–south axis along Peachtree: Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead.[100] Surrounding these high-density districts are leafy, low-density neighborhoods, most of which are dominated by single-family homes.[101]\nDowntown contains the most office space in the metro area, much of it occupied by government entities. Downtown is home to the city's sporting venues and many of its tourist attractions.[102] Midtown is the city's second-largest business district, containing the offices of many of the region's law firms. Midtown is known for its art institutions, cultural attractions, institutions of higher education, and dense form.[103][104][105][106][107] Buckhead, the city's uptown district, is eight miles (13 km) north of Downtown and the city's third-largest business district. The district is marked by an urbanized core along Peachtree Road, surrounded by suburban single-family neighborhoods situated among woods and rolling hills.[108][109][110][111]\nSurrounding Atlanta's three high-rise districts are the city's low- and medium-density neighborhoods,[108] where the craftsman bungalow single-family home is dominant.[112] The eastside is marked by historic streetcar suburbs, built from the 1890s to the 1930s as havens for the upper middle class. These neighborhoods, many of which contain their own villages encircled by shaded, architecturally distinct residential streets, include the Victorian Inman Park, Bohemian East Atlanta, and eclectic Old Fourth Ward.[113][114] On the westside and along the BeltLine on the eastside, former warehouses and factories have been converted into housing, retail space, and art galleries, transforming the once-industrial areas such as West Midtown into model neighborhoods for smart growth, historic rehabilitation, and infill construction.[115]\nIn southwest Atlanta, neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs, including the historic West End, while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout. These include Collier Heights and Cascade Heights, historically home to most of the city's upper middle-class African-American population.[116][117][118] Northwest Atlanta contains the areas of the city to west of Marietta Boulevard and to the north of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, including those neighborhoods remote to downtown, such as Riverside, Bolton and Whittier Mill. The latter is one of Atlanta's designated Landmark Historical Neighborhoods. Vine City, though technically Northwest, adjoins the city's Downtown area and has recently been the target of community outreach programs and economic development initiatives.[119]\nGentrification of the city's neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlanta. The gentrification of Atlanta has its origins in the 1970s, after many of Atlanta's neighborhoods had declined and suffered the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid-20th century. When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two freeways from being built through the city's east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's gentrification. After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990, gentrification expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games. New development post-2000 has been aided by the Atlanta Housing Authority's eradication of the city's public housing. As noted above, it allowed development of these sites for mixed-income housing, requiring developers to reserve a considerable portion for affordable housing units. It has also provided for other former residents to be given vouchers to gain housing in other areas.[120] Construction of the Beltline has stimulated new and related development along its path.[121]\nArchitecture\nMost of Atlanta was burned in the final months of the American Civil War, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. Yet architecturally, the city had never been traditionally \"southern\": Atlanta originated as a railroad town rather than a southern seaport dominated by the planter class, such as Savannah or Charleston. Because of its later development, many of the city's landmarks share architectural characteristics with buildings in the Northeast or Midwest, as they were designed at a time of shared national architectural styles.[113]\nDuring the late 20th century, Atlanta embraced the global trend of modern architecture, especially for commercial and institutional structures. Examples include the State of Georgia Building built in 1966, and the Georgia-Pacific Tower in 1982. Many of the most notable examples from this period were designed by world renowned Atlanta architect John Portman. Most of the buildings that define the downtown skyline were designed by Portman during this period, including the Westin Peachtree Plaza and the Atlanta Marriott Marquis. In the latter half of the 1980s, Atlanta became one of the early homes of postmodern buildings that reintroduced classical elements to their designs. Many of Atlanta's tallest skyscrapers were built in this period and style, displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns, such as One Atlantic Center (1987), 191 Peachtree Tower (1991), and the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta (1992). Also completed during the era was the Bank of America Plaza built-in 1992. At 1,023 feet (312 m), it is the tallest building in the city and the 14th-tallest in the United States.[122]\nThe city's embrace of modern architecture has often translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation, leading to the destruction of many notable architectural landmarks. These include the Equitable Building (1892–1971), Terminal Station (1905–1972), and the Carnegie Library (1902–1977).[123] In the mid-1970s, the Fox Theatre, now a cultural icon of the city, would have met the same fate if not for a grassroots effort to save it.[113] More recently, preservationists may have made some inroads. For example, in 2016 activists convinced the Atlanta City Council not to demolish the Atlanta-Fulton Central Library, the last building designed by noted architect Marcel Breuer.[124]\nClimate\nUnder the Köppen classification, Atlanta has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa)[125] with generous precipitation year-round, typical for the Upland South. The city is situated in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8a, with the northern and western suburbs, as well as part of Midtown transitioning to 7b.[126] Summers are hot and humid, with temperatures somewhat moderated by the city's elevation. Winters are overall mild but variable, occasionally susceptible to snowstorms even if in small quantities on several occasions, unlike the central and southern portions of the state.[127][128] Warm air from the Gulf of Mexico can bring spring-like highs while strong Arctic air masses can push lows into the teens °F (−7 to −12 °C).\nJuly averages 80.9 °F (27.2 °C), with high temperatures reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average of 47 days per year, though 100 °F (38 °C) readings are not seen most years.[129] January averages 44.8 °F (7.1 °C), with temperatures in the suburbs slightly cooler due largely to the urban heat island effect. Lows at or below freezing can be expected 36 nights annually,[130] but the last occurrences of temperatures below 10 °F (−12 °C) were December 24, 2022,[130] and January 2014, eight years apart. Extremes range from −9 °F (−23 °C) on February 13, 1899 to 106 °F (41 °C) on June 30, 2012.[130] Average dewpoints in the summer range from 63.7 °F (17.6 °C) in June to 67.8 °F (19.9 °C) in July.[131]\nTypical of the southeastern U.S., Atlanta receives abundant rainfall that is evenly distributed throughout the year, though late spring and early fall are somewhat drier. The average annual precipitation is 50.43 in (1,281 mm), while snowfall is typically light and rare with a normal of 2.2 inches (5.6 cm) per winter.[130] The heaviest single snowfall occurred on January 23, 1940, with around 10 inches (25 cm) of snow.[132] However, ice storms usually cause more problems than snowfall does, the most severe occurring on January 7, 1973.[133] Tornadoes are rare in the city itself, but the March 14, 2008, EF2 tornado damaged prominent structures in downtown Atlanta.[134]\n| Climate data for Atlanta (Hartsfield–Jackson Int'l), 1991–2020 normals,[b] extremes

Atlanta had a population of 498,715. The population density was 3,685.45 persons per square mile (1,422.95/km2). The racial and ethnic makeup of Atlanta (including Hispanics) was 51.0% Black or African American, 40.9% non-Hispanic white, 4.2% Asian and 0.3% Native American, and 1.0% from other races. 2.4% of the population reported two or more races.[156] Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 6.0% of the city's population.[157] The median income for a household in the city was $77,655 in 2022.[158] The per capita income for the city was $60,778 in 2022.[158] Approximately 17.7% percent of the population was living below the poverty line in 2022.[158] Circa 2024, of the Atlanta residents, 391,711 of them lived in Fulton County and 28,292 of them lived in DeKalb County.[159]\nIn the 1920s, the Black population began to grow in Southern metropolitan cities like Atlanta, Birmingham, Houston, and Memphis.[160] Since the 1970s, Atlanta has been widely recognized as a hub of African American political activism, education, entrepreneurship, and culture—earning it the reputation of being a Black mecca.[161][162][163] However, in the 1990s, Atlanta started to experience Black flight.[164][165] African Americans have moved outside the city seeking a lower cost of living or better public schools. The African American share of Atlanta's population has declined faster than any racial group.[166] The city's share of Black residents shrank from 67% in 1990 to 47% in 2020. Blacks made up nine percent of new Atlanta residents between 2010 and 2020.[166][71][72] At the same time, Atlanta is home to a sizable foreign-born Black population,[167] notably from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Somalia, Liberia, and Nigeria.[168]\nWith many notable investments occurring in Atlanta initiated by the 1996 Summer Olympics, the non-Hispanic White population of Atlanta began to rebound after several decades of White flight to Atlanta's suburbs.[169][170] Between 2000 and 2020, the proportion of Whites in the city had strong growth. In two decades, Atlanta's White population grew from 33% to 39% of the city's population. Whites made up the majority of new Atlanta residents between 2010 and 2020.[166][171]\nThe Hispanic and Latino populations of metro Atlanta have grown significantly in recent years.[172] The largest Hispanic ancestries in Atlanta are Mexican, Puerto Rican and Cuban.[173] There is a growing population of Mexican ancestry throughout the region, with notable concentrations along the Buford Highway and I-85 corridor, and now extending into Gwinnett County.[174] In 2013, Metro Atlanta had the 19th largest Hispanic population in the United States.[175]\nThe Atlanta area also has a fast growing Asian American population. The largest groups of Asian origin are those of Indian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Pakistani and Japanese descent.[176] Pew Research Center ranks the Atlanta area among the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas by Indian population in 2019.[177]\nEarly immigrants in the Atlanta area were mostly Jews and Greeks. Since 2010, the Atlanta area has experienced notable immigration from India, China, South Korea, and Jamaica.[178][179] Other notable source countries of immigrants are Vietnam, Eritrea, Nigeria, the Arabian gulf, Ukraine and Poland.[180] Within a few decades, and in keeping with national trends, immigrants from England, Ireland, and German-speaking central Europe were no longer the majority of Atlanta's foreign-born population. The city's Italians included immigrants from northern Italy, many of whom had been in Atlanta since the 1890s; more recent arrivals from southern Italy; and Sephardic Jews from the Isle of Rhodes, which Italy had seized from Turkey in 1912.[181] Europeans from Great Britain, Ireland and Germany settled in the city as early as the 1840s.[182] Most of Atlanta's European population are from the United Kingdom and Germany. Bosnian refugees settled in Atlanta.[183]\nVietnamese people, Cambodians, Ethiopians and Eritreans were the earliest refugees formally brought to the city.[184]\nOf the total population five years and older, 83.3% spoke only English at home, while 8.8% spoke Spanish, 3.9% another Indo-European language, and 2.8% an Asian language.[185] Among them, 7.3% of Atlantans were born abroad (86th in the US).[157][186] Atlanta's dialect has traditionally been a variation of Southern American English. The Chattahoochee River long formed a border between the Coastal Southern and Southern Appalachian dialects.[187] Because of the development of corporate headquarters in the region, attracting migrants from other areas of the country, by 2003, Atlanta magazine concluded that Atlanta had become significantly \"de-Southernized\". A Southern accent was considered a handicap in some circumstances.[188] In general, Southern accents are less prevalent among residents of the city and inner suburbs and among younger people; they are more common in the outer suburbs and among older people.[187] At the same time, some residents of the city speak in Southern variations of African-American English.[189]\nSexual orientation and gender identity\nAtlanta has a thriving and diverse lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. According to a survey by the Williams Institute, Atlanta ranked third among major American cities, behind San Francisco and slightly behind Seattle, with 12.8% of the city's total population identifying as LGB.[190] The Midtown and Cheshire Bridge areas have historically been the epicenters of LGBT culture in Atlanta.[191] Atlanta formed a reputation for being a place inclusive to LGBT people after former mayor Ivan Allen Jr. dubbed it \"the city too busy to hate\" in the 1960s (referring to racial relations).[192][193][194][195] Atlanta has consistently scored 100% on the Human Rights Campaign's Municipal Equality Index that measures how inclusive a city's laws, policies and services are for LGBT people who live or work there.[196]\nReligion\nReligion in Atlanta, while historically centered on Protestant Christianity, now encompasses many faiths, as a result of the city and metro area's increasingly international population. Some 63% of residents identified as some type of Protestant according to the Pew Research Center in 2014,[197][198] but in recent decades the Roman Catholic Church has increased in numbers and influence because of new migrants to the region. Metro Atlanta also has numerous ethnic or national Christian congregations, including Korean and Indian churches. Per the Public Religion Research Institute in 2020, overall, 73% of the population identify with some tradition or denomination of Christianity;[199] despite continuing religious diversification, historically African-American Protestant churches continue prevalence in the whole metropolitan area alongside historic Black Catholic churches. The larger non-Christian faiths according to both studies are Judaism, Islam, and Hinduism. Overall, there are over 1,000 places of worship within Atlanta.[200]\nEconomy\nWith a GDP of $385 billion,[201] the Atlanta metropolitan area's economy is the 8th-largest in the country and the 15th-largest in the world. Corporate operations play a major role in Atlanta's economy, as the city claims the nation's third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies (tied for third with Chicago).[202][203] It also hosts the global headquarters of several corporations such as The Coca-Cola Company,[204] The Home Depot,[205] Delta Air Lines,[206] Arby's,[207] AT&T Mobility,[208] Georgia-Pacific,[209] Chick-fil-A,[210] Church's Chicken,[211] Dunkin' Donuts,[212] Norfolk Southern Railway,[213] Mercedes-Benz USA,[214] NAPA Auto Parts, Papa John's,[215] Porsche AG,[216] Newell Brands, Rollins, Inc., Marble Slab Creamery, and UPS.[217] Over 75% of Fortune 1000 companies conduct business operations in the city's metro area, and the region hosts offices of over 1,250 multinational corporations.[218] Many corporations are drawn to the city by its educated workforce; as of 2014[update], 45% of adults aged 25 or older residing in the city have at least four-year college degrees, compared to the national average of 28%.[219][220][221]\nAtlanta was born as a railroad town, and logistics continue to represent an important part of the city's economy to this day. In 2021, major freight railroad Norfolk Southern moved their headquarters to Atlanta,[222] and the city hosts major classification yards for Norfolk Southern and CSX. Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the world's busiest airport,[223] and the headquarters of Delta Air Lines. Delta operates the world's largest airline hub at Hartsfield-Jackson and is metro Atlanta's largest employer.[224] UPS, the world's largest courier company, operates an air cargo hub at Hartsfield-Jackson, and has their headquarters in neighboring Sandy Springs.\nMedia is also an important aspect of Atlanta's economy. In the 1980s, media mogul Ted Turner founded the Cable News Network (CNN), Turner Network Television (TNT),[225] HLN (HLN), Turner Classic Movies (TCM), The Cartoon Network, Inc. and its namesake television network, TruTV (truTV) and the Turner Broadcasting System (TBS) in the city.[226] Around the same time, Cox Enterprises, now the nation's third-largest cable television service and the publisher of over a dozen American newspapers, moved its headquarters to the city.[227] Notable sports networks headquartered in Atlanta include TNT Sports, NBA TV, Bally Sports South, and Bally Sports Southeast.[228][229] The Weather Channel is also based just outside of the city in suburban Cobb County.[230]\nInformation technology (IT) has become an increasingly important part of Atlanta's economic output, earning the city the nickname the \"Silicon peach\". As of 2013[update], Atlanta contains the fourth-largest concentration of IT jobs in the US, numbering 85,000+. The city is also ranked as the sixth fastest-growing for IT jobs, with an employment growth of 4.8% in 2012 and a three-year growth near 9%, or 16,000 jobs. Companies are drawn to Atlanta's lower costs and educated workforce.[231][232][233][234]\nRecently, Atlanta has been the center for film and television production, largely because of the Georgia Entertainment Industry Investment Act, which awards qualified productions a transferable income tax credit of 20% of all in-state costs for film and television investments of $500,000 or more.[235][236] Film and television production facilities based in Atlanta include Techwood Studios, Pinewood Atlanta Studios, Tyler Perry Studios, Williams Street Productions, and the EUE/Screen Gems soundstages. Film and television production injected $9.5 billion into Georgia's economy in 2017, with Atlanta garnering most of the projects.[237] Atlanta has emerged as the all-time most popular destination for film production in the United States and one of the 10 most popular destinations globally.[235][238]\nCompared to other American cities, Atlanta's economy was disproportionately affected by the Great Recession, with the city's economy being ranked 68th among 100 American cities in a September 2014 report due to an elevated unemployment rate, declining real income levels, and a depressed housing market.[239][240][241][242] From 2010 to 2011, Atlanta saw a 0.9% contraction in employment and plateauing income growth at 0.4%. Although unemployment had decreased to 7% by late 2014, this was still higher than the national unemployment rate of 5.8%.[243] Atlanta's housing market has also struggled, with home prices dropping by 2.1% in January 2012, reaching levels not seen since 1996. Compared with a year earlier, the average home price in Atlanta plummeted to 17.3% in February 2012, thus becoming the largest annual drop in the history of the index for any American or global city.[244][245] The decline in home prices prompted some economists to deem Atlanta the worst housing market in the nation at the height of the depression.[246] Nevertheless, the city's real estate market has resurged since 2012, so much median home value and rent growth significantly outpaced the national average by 2018, thanks to a rapidly-growing regional economy.[247][248][249]\nArts and culture\nAtlanta has drawn residents from many other parts of the U.S., in addition to many recent immigrants to the U.S. who have made the metropolitan area their home, establishing Atlanta as the cultural and economic hub of an increasingly multi-cultural metropolitan area.[250][251] This unique cultural combination reveals itself in the arts district of Midtown, the quirky neighborhoods on the city's eastside, and the multi-ethnic enclaves found along Buford Highway.[252]\nArts and theater\nAtlanta is one of few United States cities with permanent, professional, and resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines: opera (Atlanta Opera), ballet (Atlanta Ballet), orchestral music (Atlanta Symphony Orchestra), and theater (the Alliance Theatre).[253][254][255][256] Atlanta attracts many touring Broadway acts, concerts, shows, and exhibitions catering to a variety of interests. Atlanta's performing arts district is concentrated in Midtown Atlanta at the Woodruff Arts Center, which is home to the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Alliance Theatre. The city frequently hosts touring Broadway acts, especially at The Fox Theatre, a historic landmark among the highest-grossing theaters of its size.[257]\nAs a national center for the arts,[258] Atlanta is home to significant art museums and institutions. The renowned High Museum of Art is arguably the South's leading art museum. The Museum of Design Atlanta (MODA) and the SCAD FASH Museum of Fashion + Film are the only such museums in the Southeast.[259][260] Contemporary art museums include the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia. A recent arts addition is known as The Warehouse, a storage facility that was turned into a world-class art gallery featuring more than 400 works of art collected over more than 40 years, the collection open to the public for free.[261] Institutions of higher education contribute to Atlanta's art scene, with the Savannah College of Art and Design's Atlanta campus providing the city's arts community with a steady stream of curators. Emory University's Michael C. Carlos Museum contains the largest collection of ancient art in the Southeast.[262] The Spelman College Museum of Fine Art is the only museum in the nation to focus on art by women of the African diaspora.[263] Georgia Tech's Robert C. Williams Museum of Papermaking features the largest collection of paper and paper-related artifacts in the world.[264]\nAtlanta has become one of the U.S.'s best cities for street art in recent years.[265] It is home to Living Walls, an annual street art conference and the Outerspace Project, an annual event series that merges public art, live music, design, action sports, and culture. Examples of street art in Atlanta can be found on the Atlanta Street Art Map.[266]\nMusic\nAtlanta is home to the nationally known Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, whose music directors have included Robert Shaw (1967–1988), Yoel Levi (1988–2000), Robert Spano (2001–2021), and Nathalie Stutzmann (2022–present). The orchestra presents a season-long series of concerts including prominent world soloists such as pianists Kirill Gerstein, Yeol Eum Son, Inon Barnatan, Lang Lang, Francesco Piemontesi, cellist Alisa Weilerstein, singer Andrea Bocelli and many others.\nAtlanta has played a major or contributing role in the development of various genres of American music at different points in the city's history. Beginning as early as the 1920s, Atlanta emerged as a center for country music, which was brought to the city by migrants from Appalachia.[267] During the countercultural 1960s, Atlanta hosted the Atlanta International Pop Festival, with the 1969 festival taking place more than a month before Woodstock and featuring many of the same bands. The city was also a center for Southern rock during its 1970s heyday: the Allman Brothers Band's hit instrumental \"Hot 'Lanta\" is an ode to the city, while Lynyrd Skynyrd's famous live rendition of \"Free Bird\" was recorded at the Fox Theatre in 1976, with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant directing the band to \"play it pretty for Atlanta\".[268] During the 1980s, Atlanta had an active punk rock scene centered on two of the city's music venues, 688 Club and the Metroplex, and Atlanta famously played host to the Sex Pistols' first U.S. show, which was performed at the Great Southeastern Music Hall.[269] The 1990s saw the city produce major mainstream acts across many different musical genres. Country music artist Travis Tritt, and R&B sensations Xscape, TLC, Usher and Toni Braxton, were just some of the musicians who call Atlanta home. The city also gave birth to Atlanta hip hop, a sub-genre that gained relevance and success with the introduction of the home-grown Atlantans known as Outkast, along with other Dungeon Family artists such as Organized Noize and Goodie Mob; however, it was not until the 2000s that Atlanta moved \"from the margins to becoming hip-hop's center of gravity with another sub-genre called Crunk, part of a larger shift in hip-hop innovation to the South and East\".[270][271][272][273] In the 2000s, Atlanta was recognized by the Brooklyn-based Vice magazine for its indie rock scene, which revolves around the various live music venues found on the city's alternative eastside.[274][275] To facilitate further local development, the state government provides qualified businesses and productions a 15% transferable income tax credit for in-state costs of music investments.[276]\nFilm and television\nAs the national leader for motion picture and television production,[235][277] and a top ten global leader,[238][235] Atlanta plays a significant role in the entertainment industry. Atlanta is home to the Tyler Perry Studios which is one of the largest film production studios in the U.S.[278][279] Atlanta doubles for other parts of the world and fictional settlements in blockbuster productions, among them the newer titles from The Fast and the Furious franchise and Marvel features such as Ant-Man (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), The Change Up (2011), Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War (both 2018).[280][281] On the other hand, Gone With the Wind (1939), Smokey and the Bandit (1977), The Dukes of Hazzard (1979), Sharky's Machine (1981), The Slugger's Wife (1985), Driving Miss Daisy (1989),[282] ATL (2006), Ride Along (2014) and Baby Driver (2017) are among several notable examples of films actually set in Atlanta.[283][284] It was announced in 2022 a film about the 1956 Sugar Bowl and '56 Atlanta riots would be produced here.[285][286]\nTV shows\nThe city also provides the backdrop for shows such as Ozark, Watchmen, The Walking Dead, Stranger Things, Love Is Blind, Star, Dolly Parton's Heartstrings, The Outsider, The Vampire Diaries, The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta and Atlanta, in addition to a myriad of animated and reality television programming.[235][287][288]\nFestivals\nAtlanta's festival season stretches from January through November.[289] Atlanta has more festivals than any city in the southeastern United States.[290] Some notable festivals in Atlanta include the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, Shaky Knees Music Festival, Dragon Con, the Peachtree Road Race, Music Midtown, the Atlanta Film Festival, National Black Arts Festival, Festival Peachtree Latino, the neighborhood festivals in Inman Park, Atkins Park, Virginia-Highland (Summerfest), and the Little Five Points Halloween festival.[291][292]\nTourism\nAs of 2010[update], Atlanta is the seventh-most visited city in the United States, with over 35 million visitors per year.[293] Although the most popular attraction among visitors to Atlanta is the Georgia Aquarium,[294] and until 2012, the world's largest indoor aquarium, Atlanta's tourism industry is mostly driven by the city's history museums and outdoor attractions. Atlanta contains a notable number of historical museums and sites, including the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park, which includes the preserved childhood home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as his final resting place; the Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum, which houses a massive painting and diorama in-the-round, depicting the Battle of Atlanta in the Civil War; the World of Coca-Cola, featuring the history of the world-famous soft drink brand and its well-known advertising; the College Football Hall of Fame, which honors college football and its athletes; the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, which explores the civil rights movement and its connection to contemporary human rights movements throughout the world; the Carter Center and Presidential Library, housing U.S. President Jimmy Carter's papers and other material relating to the Carter administration and the Carter family's life; and the Margaret Mitchell House and Museum, where Mitchell wrote the best-selling novel Gone with the Wind.[295]\nAtlanta contains several outdoor attractions.[296] The Atlanta Botanical Garden, adjacent to Piedmont Park, is home to the 600-foot-long (180 m) Kendeda Canopy Walk, a skywalk that allows visitors to tour one of the city's last remaining urban forests from 40 feet (12 m) above the ground. The Canopy Walk is the only canopy-level pathway of its kind in the United States.[297] Zoo Atlanta, in Grant Park, accommodates over 1,300 animals representing more than 220 species. Home to the nation's largest collections of gorillas and orangutans, the zoo is one of only four zoos in the U.S. to house giant pandas.[298] Festivals showcasing arts and crafts, film, and music, including the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, the Atlanta Film Festival, and Music Midtown, respectively, are also popular with tourists.[299]\nTourists are drawn to the city's culinary scene,[300] which comprises a mix of urban establishments garnering national attention, ethnic restaurants serving cuisine from every corner of the world, and traditional eateries specializing in Southern dining. Since the turn of the 21st century, Atlanta has emerged as a sophisticated restaurant town.[301] Many restaurants opened in the city's gentrifying neighborhoods have received praise at the national level, including Bocado, Bacchanalia, and Miller Union in West Midtown, Empire State South in Midtown, and Two Urban Licks and Rathbun's on the east side.[82][302][303][304] In 2011, The New York Times characterized Empire State South and Miller Union as reflecting \"a new kind of sophisticated Southern sensibility centered on the farm but experienced in the city\".[305] Visitors seeking to sample international Atlanta are directed to Buford Highway, the city's international corridor, and suburban Gwinnett County. There, the nearly-million immigrants that make Atlanta home have established various authentic ethnic restaurants representing virtually every nationality on the globe.[306][307] For traditional Southern fare, one of the city's most famous establishments is The Varsity, a long-lived fast food chain and the world's largest drive-in restaurant.[308] Mary Mac's Tea Room and Paschal's are more formal destinations for Southern food.[309][310]\nCuisine\nAtlanta is best known for its barbecue, hamburgers, Southern fried chicken, and lemon pepper wings.[311][312] Buford Highway (immediately northeast of Atlanta) is home to many authentic ethnic cuisines such as Mexican and Asian foods.[313] Atlanta's culinary landscape is highlighted by its inclusion in the prestigious Michelin Guide, featuring several restaurants recognized for their exceptional cuisine and premier dining destination in the Southeast.[314] Atlanta's rapidly expanding food scene is marked by a notable diversity, particularly with the increasing variety and number of Indian restaurants across the city and its metropolitan area,[315] including Chai Pani, a Michelin Guide restaurant.\nSports\nSports are an important part of the culture of Atlanta. The city is home to professional franchises for four major team sports: the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball,[316] the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association,[317] the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League,[318] and Atlanta United FC of Major League Soccer.[319] In addition, many of the city's universities participate in collegiate sports. The city also regularly hosts international, professional, and collegiate sporting events.[320]\nThe Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966. Originally established as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871, they are the oldest continually operating professional sports franchise in the United States.[321] The Braves franchise overall has won eighteen National League pennants and four World Series championships in three different cities, with their first in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 and 2021 as the Atlanta Braves.[322] The 1995 title occurred during an unprecedented run of 14 straight divisional championships from 1991 to 2005.[323][324] The team plays at Truist Park, having moved from Turner Field for the 2017 season. The new stadium is outside the city limits, located 10 miles (16 km) northwest of downtown in the Cumberland/Galleria area of Cobb County.[325]\nThe Atlanta Falcons have played in Atlanta since their inception in 1966. The team plays its home games at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, having moved from the Georgia Dome in 2017. The Falcons have won the division title six times (1980, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2012, 2016) and the NFC championship in 1998 and 2016. They have been unsuccessful in both of their Super Bowl trips, losing to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999 and to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI in 2017,[326] the largest comeback in Super Bowl history.[327] In 2019, Atlanta also briefly hosted an Alliance of American Football team, the Atlanta Legends, but the league was suspended during its first season and the team folded.\nThe Atlanta Hawks were founded in 1946 as the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, playing in Moline, Illinois. They moved to Atlanta from St. Louis in 1968 and play their games in State Farm Arena.[328] The Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association shared an arena with the Hawks for most of their existence; however the WNBA team moved to a smaller arena in the southern Atlanta suburb of College Park in 2021.[329]\nProfessional soccer has been played in some form in Atlanta since 1967. Atlanta's first professional soccer team was the Atlanta Chiefs of the original North American Soccer League which won the 1968 NASL Championship and defeated English first division club Manchester City F.C. twice in international friendlies. In 1998 the Atlanta Silverbacks were formed, playing the new North American Soccer League. They now play as an amateur club in the National Premier Soccer League. In 2017, Atlanta United FC began play as Atlanta's first premier-division professional soccer club since the Chiefs.[330] They won MLS Cup 2018, defeating the Portland Timbers 2–0. Fan reception has been very positive; the team has broken several single-game and season attendance records for both MLS and the U.S. Open Cup. The club is estimated by Forbes to be the most valuable club in Major League Soccer.[331] The United States Soccer Federation moved their headquarters from Chicago to Atlanta in 2023 with the help of Falcons and Atlanta United owner Arthur Blank, with the new training center bearing his name. Atlanta will receive a NWSL team in 2028.\nIn ice hockey, Atlanta has had two National Hockey League franchises, both of which relocated to a city in Canada after playing in Atlanta for fewer than 15 years. The Atlanta Flames (now the Calgary Flames) played from 1972 to 1980, and the Atlanta Thrashers (now the Winnipeg Jets) played from 1999 to 2011. The Atlanta Gladiators, a minor league hockey team in the ECHL, have played in the Atlanta suburb of Duluth since 2003.[332]\nThe ASUN Conference moved its headquarters to Atlanta in 2019.[333]\nSeveral other emerging sports also have professional franchises in Atlanta. The Georgia Swarm compete in the National Lacrosse League. The Atlanta Vibe compete in the Pro Volleyball Federation. In Rugby union, on September 21, 2018, Major League Rugby announced that Atlanta was one of the expansion teams joining the league for the 2020 season[334] named Rugby ATL.[335] while in Rugby league, on March 31, 2021, Atlanta Rhinos left the USA Rugby League and turned fully professional for the first time, joining the new North American Rugby League.[336]\nAtlanta has long been known as the \"capital\" of college football in America.[337] It is home to four-time national champion Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football and the Georgia State Panthers. Also, Atlanta is approximately an hours driving distance from the eight-time national championship winning Georgia Bulldogs football stadium and within a few hours driving distance of many of the other universities that make up the Southeastern Conference, college football's most profitable and popular conference,[338] and annually hosts the SEC Championship Game. Other annual college football events include the Aflac Kickoff Game, the Celebration Bowl, the MEAC/SWAC Challenge, and the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl which is one of College Football's major New Year's Six Bowl games and a College Football Playoff bowl.[339] Atlanta additionally hosted the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship and eventually would the host the 2025 event in the city as well.\nAtlanta regularly hosts a variety of sporting events. Most famous was the Centennial 1996 Summer Olympics.[340][341][342][343] The city has hosted the Super Bowl three times: Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994, Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000, and Super Bowl LIII in 2019.[344] In professional golf, The Tour Championship, the final PGA Tour event of the season, is played annually at East Lake Golf Club. In 2001 and 2011, Atlanta hosted the PGA Championship, one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, at the Atlanta Athletic Club. In 2011, Atlanta hosted professional wrestling's annual WrestleMania.[345] In soccer, Atlanta has hosted numerous international friendlies and CONCACAF Gold Cup matches. The city has hosted the NCAA Final Four Men's Basketball Championship five times, most recently in 2020.[citation needed] Atlanta will serve as one of the eleven US host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[346] Every summer, Atlanta hosts the Atlanta Open, a men's professional tennis tournament.\nRunning is a popular local sport, and the city declares itself to be \"Running City USA\".[347] The city hosts the Peachtree Road Race, the world's largest 10 km race, annually on Independence Day.[348] Atlanta also hosts the nation's largest Thanksgiving day half marathon, which starts and ends at Center Parc Stadium.[349] The Atlanta Marathon, which starts and ends at Centennial Olympic Park, routes through many of the city's historic landmarks.[350]\nParks and recreation\nAtlanta's 343 parks, nature preserves, and gardens cover 3,622 acres (14.66 km2),[351] which amounts to only 5.6% of the city's total acreage, compared to the national average of just over 10%.[352][353] However, 77% of Atlantans live within a 10-minute walk of a park, a percentage slightly better than the national average of 76%.[354] In its 2023 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported that among the park systems of the 100 most populous U.S. cities, Atlanta's park system received a ranking of 28.[354] Piedmont Park, in Midtown, is Atlanta's most iconic green space.[355][356] The park, which underwent a major renovation and expansion in recent years, attracts visitors from across the region and hosts cultural events throughout the year. Shirley Clarke Franklin Park, a 280-acre green space and reservoir, opened in 2021 and is the city's largest park. Other notable city parks include Centennial Olympic Park, a legacy of the 1996 Summer Olympics that forms the centerpiece of the city's tourist district; Woodruff Park, which anchors the campus of Georgia State University; Grant Park, home to Zoo Atlanta; and Chastain Park, which houses an amphitheater used for live music concerts.[357] The Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, in the northwestern corner of the city, preserves a 48 mi (77 km) stretch of the river for public recreation opportunities.[358]\nThe Atlanta Botanical Garden, adjacent to Piedmont Park, contains formal gardens, including a Japanese garden and a rose garden, woodland areas, and a conservatory that includes indoor exhibits of plants from tropical rainforests and deserts. The BeltLine, a former rail corridor that forms a 22 mi (35 km) loop around Atlanta's core, has been transformed into a series of parks, connected by a multi-use trail, increasing Atlanta's park space by 40%.[359]\nAtlanta offers resources and opportunities for amateur and participatory sports and recreation. Golf and tennis are popular in Atlanta, and the city contains six public golf courses and 182 tennis courts. Facilities along the Chattahoochee River cater to watersports enthusiasts, providing the opportunity for kayaking, canoeing, fishing, boating, or tubing. The city's only skate park, a 15,000 square feet (1,400 m2) facility that offers bowls, curbs, and smooth-rolling concrete mounds, is at Historic Fourth Ward Park.[360]\nTree canopy\nFor a sprawling city with the nation's ninth-largest metro area, Atlanta is surprisingly lush with trees—magnolias, dogwoods, Southern pines, and magnificent oaks.\nAtlanta has a reputation as a \"city in a forest\" due to an abundance of trees that is rare among major cities.[362][363][364] The city's main street is named after a tree, and beyond the Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead business districts, the skyline gives way to a dense canopy of woods that spreads into the suburbs. The city is home to the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, an annual arts and crafts festival held one weekend during early April, when the native dogwoods are in bloom. The nickname is factually accurate, as vegetation covers 47.9% of the city as of 2017,[365] the highest among all major American cities, and well above the national average of 27%.[366] Atlanta's tree coverage does not go unnoticed—it was the main reason cited by National Geographic in naming Atlanta a \"Place of a Lifetime\".[361][367]\nThe city's lush tree canopy, which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and buildings, has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due to heavy rains, drought, aged forests, new pests, and urban construction. A 2001 study found Atlanta's heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 1974 to 38% in 1996.[368] Community organizations and the city government are addressing the problem. Trees Atlanta, a non-profit organization founded in 1985, has planted and distributed over 113,000 shade trees in the city,[369] and Atlanta's government has awarded $130,000 in grants to neighborhood groups to plant trees.[363] Fees are additionally imposed on developers that remove trees on their property per a citywide ordinance, active since 1993.[370]\nGovernment\n| Year | Democratic | Republican | Others |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2020 | 82.6% 200,717 | 16.2% 39,372 | 1.2% 2,972 |\n| 2016 | 80.6% 164,643 | 15.7% 32,092 | 3.6% 7,452 |\nAtlanta is governed by a mayor and the 15-member Atlanta City Council. The city council consists of one member from each of the city's 12 districts and three at-large members. The mayor may veto a bill passed by the council, but the council can override the veto with a two-thirds majority.[372] The mayor of Atlanta is Andre Dickens, a Democrat elected on a nonpartisan ballot whose first term in office began on January 3, 2022.[373][374] Every mayor elected since 1973 has been Black.[375] In 2001, Shirley Franklin became the first woman to be elected mayor of Atlanta, and the first African-American woman to serve as mayor of a major Southern city.[376] Atlanta city politics suffered from a notorious reputation for corruption during the 1990s administration of Mayor Bill Campbell, who was convicted by a federal jury in 2006 on three counts of tax evasion in connection with gambling winnings during trips he took with city contractors.[377]\nAs the state capital, Atlanta is the site of most of Georgia's state government. The Georgia State Capitol building, located downtown, houses the offices of the governor, lieutenant governor and secretary of state, as well as the General Assembly. The Governor's Mansion is in a residential section of Buckhead. Atlanta serves as the regional hub for many arms of the federal bureaucracy, including the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[378][379] The City of Atlanta annexed the CDC into its territory effective January 1, 2018.[380] Atlanta also plays an important role in the federal judiciary system, containing the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.[381]\nHistorically, Atlanta has been a stronghold for the Democratic Party. Although municipal elections are officially nonpartisan, nearly all of the city's elected officials are registered Democrats. The city is split among 14 state house districts and four state senate districts, all held by Democrats. At the federal level, Atlanta is split between three congressional districts. Most of the city is in the 5th district, represented by Democrat Nikema Williams. Much of southern Atlanta is in the 13th district, represented by Democrat David Scott. A small portion in the north is in the 11th district, represented by Republican Barry Loudermilk.[382]\nEmergency services\nThe city is served by the Atlanta Police Department (APD), which numbers 2,000 officers[383] and oversaw a 40% decrease in the city's crime rate between 2001 and 2009. In 2012, Forbes ranked Atlanta as the 6th most dangerous American city but by 2023 the city dropped out of its top 10.[384][385] Despite some improvement in crime, street gangs have continued to plague the city since the 1980s.[386][387][388][389] In 2022, there was a 200% increase in gang-related charges in the city.[388] In 2023, Money Inc named Atlanta the third worst gang city in the U.S.[390] Also in 2023, it was estimated that about 1,000 gangs in the Atlanta area were responsible for at least 70% of all crime including identity theft, credit card fraud, drug trafficking, and human trafficking. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation Gang Task Force in partnership with the APD is leading efforts in dismantling gang activity and arresting culprits.[391]\nThe Atlanta Fire Rescue Department provides fire protection and first responder emergency medical services to the city from its 35 fire stations. In 2017, AFRD responded to over 100,000 calls for service over a coverage area of 135.7 square miles (351.5 square kilometers). The department also protects Hartsfield–Jackson with five fire stations on the property, serving over 1 million passengers from over 100 countries. The department protects over 3000 high-rise buildings, 23 miles (37 kilometers) of the rapid rail system, and 60 miles (97 kilometers) of interstate highway.[392]\nThe Georgia National Guard is based in the city.[393]\nEmergency ambulance services are provided to city residents by hospital-based Grady EMS (Fulton County),[394] and American Medical Response (DeKalb County).[395]\nAtlanta in January 2017 declared the city was a \"welcoming city\" and \"will remain open and welcoming to all\". Nonetheless, Atlanta does not consider itself to be a \"sanctuary city\".[396] Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said: \"Our city does not support ICE. We don't have a relationship with the U.S. Marshal's Service. We closed our detention center to ICE detainees, and we would not pick up people on an immigration violation.\"[397]\nIn 2025, Atlanta Public Safety Training Center opened a $118 million training center for police and firefighters.[398][399]\nEducation\nTertiary education\nWith more than 15 colleges and universities, including three law schools and two medical schools, Atlanta is considered one of the nation's largest hubs for higher education. Three universities have earned the highest classification of \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[400][401]\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology, commonly referred to as Georgia Tech, is a prominent public research university in Midtown. It offers highly ranked degree programs in engineering, design, industrial management, the sciences, business, and architecture.[402][403]\nGeorgia State University is a major public research university based in Downtown Atlanta; it is the second largest in student population of the 26 public colleges and universities in the University System of Georgia and is a significant contributor to the revitalization of the city's central business district.[404]\nAtlanta is home to nationally renowned private colleges and universities, most notably Emory University, a leading liberal arts and research institution that operates Emory Healthcare, the largest health care system in Georgia.[405] The City of Atlanta annexed Emory into its territory effective January 1, 2018.[380]\nThe Atlanta University Center is also in the city; it is the nation's only contiguous consortium of historically black colleges, comprising Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and Morehouse School of Medicine.[406][407][408][409] Atlanta contains a campus of the Savannah College of Art and Design, a private art and design university that has proven to be a major factor in the recent growth of Atlanta's visual art community. Atlanta also boasts American Bar Association accredited law schools: Atlanta's John Marshall Law School, Emory University School of Law, and Georgia State University College of Law.[410]\nThe University of Georgia's Terry College of Business operates a satellite campus in Atlanta's Buckhead district, a major financial center in the city.[411] This location facilitates Executive and Professional MBA programs plus executive education offerings. The Buckhead campus also serves as a hub where Terry students, alumni, faculty, and staff can engage with the business community.[412]\nThe Atlanta Regional Council of Higher Education (ARCHE) is dedicated to strengthening synergy among 19 public and private colleges and universities in the Atlanta region. Participating Atlanta region colleges and universities partner on joint-degree programs, cross-registration, library services, and cultural events.[413]\nPrimary and secondary education\nApproximately 49,000 students are enrolled in 106 schools in Atlanta Public Schools (APS), some of which are operated as charter schools.[414][415] Atlanta is served by many private schools including, without limitation, Atlanta Jewish Academy,[416] Atlanta International School,[417] The Westminster Schools,[418] Pace Academy,[419] The Lovett School,[420] The Paideia School,[421] Holy Innocents' Episcopal School[422] and Roman Catholic parochial schools operated by the Archdiocese of Atlanta.\nIn 2018 the City of Atlanta annexed a portion of DeKalb County containing the Centers for Disease Control and Emory University; this portion was to be zoned to the DeKalb County School District until 2024, when it was to transition into APS.[423] In 2017 the number of children living in the annexed territory who attended public schools was nine.[424]\nMedia\nThe primary network-affiliated television stations in Atlanta are WSB-TV 2 (ABC),[425] WAGA-TV 5 (Fox).,[426] WXIA-TV 11 (NBC),[427] WPXA-TV 14 (Ion), WPCH-TV 17, (CW),[428] WUVG-TV 34 (Univision/UniMás), WATL 36 (MyNetworkTV), WANF 46 (Independent),[429] WKTB-CD 47 (Telemundo) and WUPA 69 (CBS). The Atlanta metropolitan area is served by two public television stations (both PBS member stations), and two public radio stations. WGTV 8 is the flagship station of the statewide Georgia Public Television network, while WABE-TV 30 is owned by Atlanta Public Schools. Georgia Public Radio is listener-funded and comprises one NPR member station, WABE, a classical music station also operated by Atlanta Public Schools. The second public radio, listener-funded NPR member station is WCLK, a jazz music station owned and operated by Clark Atlanta University.[430]\nAtlanta is served by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is the result of a 1950 merger between The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, with staff consolidation occurring in 1982 and separate publication of the morning Constitution and afternoon Journal ceasing in 2001.[431] Alternative weekly newspapers include Creative Loafing, which has a weekly print circulation of 80,000. Atlanta Daily World is the oldest Black newspaper in Atlanta and one of the earliest Black newspapers in American history.[432] Atlanta magazine is a monthly general-interest magazine based in and covering Atlanta.[433]\nTransportation\nAtlanta's transportation infrastructure comprises a complex network that includes a heavy rail rapid transit system, a light rail streetcar loop, a multi-county bus system, Amtrak service via the Crescent, multiple freight train lines, an Interstate Highway System, several airports, including the world's busiest, and over 45 miles (72 km) of bike paths.[434]\nAtlanta has a network of freeways that radiate out from the city, and automobiles are the dominant means of transportation in the region.[435] Three major interstate highways converge in Atlanta: I-20 (east-west), I-75 (northwest-southeast), and I-85 (northeast-southwest). The latter two combine in the middle of the city to form the Downtown Connector (I-75/85), which carries more than 340,000 vehicles per day and is one of the most congested segments of interstate highway in the United States.[436] Atlanta is mostly encircled by Interstate 285, a beltway locally known as \"the Perimeter\" that has come to mark the boundary between \"Inside the Perimeter\" (ITP), the city and close-in suburbs, and \"Outside the Perimeter\" (OTP), the outer suburbs and exurbs. The heavy reliance on automobiles for transportation in Atlanta has resulted in traffic, commute, and air pollution rates that rank among the worst in the country.[437][438][439] The City of Atlanta has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 15.2 percent of Atlanta households lacked a car, and increased slightly to 16.4 percent in 2016. The national average is 8.7 percent in 2016. Atlanta averaged 1.31 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.[440]\nThe Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) provides public transportation in the form of buses, heavy rail, and a downtown light rail loop.[441] Notwithstanding heavy automotive usage in Atlanta, the city's subway system is the eighth busiest in the country.[442] MARTA rail lines connect key destinations, such as the airport, Downtown, Midtown, Buckhead, and Perimeter Center. However, significant destinations, such as Emory University and Cumberland, remain unserved. As a result, a 2011 Brookings Institution study placed Atlanta 91st of 100 metro areas for transit accessibility.[443] Emory University operates its Cliff shuttle buses with 200,000 boardings per month, while private minibuses supply Buford Highway. Amtrak, the national rail passenger system, provides service to Atlanta via the Crescent train (New York–New Orleans), which stops at Peachtree Station. In 2014, the Atlanta Streetcar opened to the public. The streetcar's line, which is also known as the Downtown Loop, runs 2.7 miles (4.3 km) around the downtown tourist areas of Peachtree Center, Centennial Olympic Park, the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park, and Sweet Auburn.[444] The Atlanta Streetcar line is also being expanded on in the coming years to include a wider range of Atlanta's neighborhoods and important places of interest, with a total of over 50 miles (80 km) of track in the plan.[445]\nHartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the world's busiest airport as measured by passenger traffic and aircraft traffic.[446] The facility offers air service to over 150 U.S. destinations and more than 75 international destinations in 50 countries, with over 2,500 arrivals and departures daily.[447] Delta Air Lines maintains its largest hub at the airport.[448] Situated 10 miles (16 km) south of downtown in Clayton and Fulton counties, the airport covers most of the land inside a wedge formed by Interstate 75, Interstate 85, and Interstate 285.[449]\nCycling is a growing mode of transportation in Atlanta, more than doubling since 2009, when it comprised 1.1% of all commutes (up from 0.3% in 2000).[450][451] Although Atlanta's lack of bike lanes and hilly topography may deter many residents from cycling,[450][452] the city's transportation plan calls for the construction of 226 miles (364 km) of bike lanes by 2020, with the BeltLine helping to achieve this goal.[453] In 2012, Atlanta's first \"bike track\" was constructed on 10th Street in Midtown. The two lane bike track runs from Monroe Drive west to Charles Allen Drive, with connections to the Beltline and Piedmont Park.[454] Starting in June 2016, Atlanta received a bike sharing program, known as Relay Bike Share, with 100 bikes in Downtown and Midtown, which expanded to 500 bikes at 65 stations as of April 2017.[455][456]\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey (five-year average), 68.6% of working city of Atlanta residents commuted by driving alone, 7% carpooled, 10% used public transportation, and 4.6% walked. About 2.1% used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 7.6% worked at home.[457]\nThe city has also become one of a handful of \"scooter capitals\", where companies like Lime[458] and Bird[459][460] have gained a major foothold by placing electric scooters on street corners and byways.\nNotable people\nSister cities\nAtlanta's sister cities are:[461]\n- Montego Bay, Jamaica (1972)\n- Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (1972)\n- Lagos, Nigeria (1974)\n- Toulouse, France (1974)\n- Newcastle upon Tyne, England, UK (1977)\n- Taipei, Taiwan (1979)\n- Daegu, South Korea (1981)\n- Brussels, Belgium (1983)\n- Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago (1987)\n- Tbilisi, Georgia (1988)\n- Olympia, Greece (1994)\n- Bucharest, Romania (1994)\n- Cotonou, Benin (1995)\n- Salcedo, Dominican Republic (1996)\n- Torrejon de Ardoz, Spain (1996)\n- Nuremberg, Germany (1998)\n- Ra'anana, Israel (2000)\n- Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2004)\n- Fukuoka, Japan (2005)\n- Sassari, Italy (2020)\nSee also\n- USS Atlanta, 5 ships\nNotes\n- ^ /ætˈlæntə/ ⓘ at-LAN-ə[15]\n- ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n- ^ Official records for Atlanta were kept at the Weather Bureau in downtown from October 1878 to August 1928, and at Hartsfield–Jackson Int'l since September 1928.[135]\nReferences\n- ^ \"Atlanta May No Longer Be the City in a Forest\".

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object.

The mayor’s plans failed toappease many who called forSan Diego’s ﬁrst Democraticleader in 20 years to step downless than eight months into hisfour-year term. Seven womenidentiﬁed themselves as targetsof Filner’s unwanted advancesthat include touching.“Two weeks of therapy mayhelp Bob Filner with his per-sonal problems, but it does nothelp to address the needs of SanDiego,” said Laura Fink, a politi-cal consultant who alleges thatFilner patted her buttocks at a2005 fundraiser when she wasdeputy campaign manager forthe then-congressman. She isone of seven women who havepublicly identiﬁed themselvesas targets of Filner’s advances.Scott Peters, a ﬁrst-termDemocratic congressman fromSan Diego, said the mayorwould be unable to accomplishanything with controversy swirl-ing around him.“I understand the mayor feelslike he wants help, and I thinkthat’s great,” Peters said. “I justdon’t think it’s appropriate forhim to do it as mayor. It’s prettyclear to me that he’s not going tobe in a position to lead the city.”Lucas Powell, who works ata coffee house in the upscalePoint Loma area and voted forFilner, said he was unimpressedby Filner’s announcement andbelieves the former 10-term con-gressman should step down asmayor.“Two weeks isn’t going changedeep-seated opinions and behav-iors,” Powell, 30, said during alull in business Friday night.Julaine Rich, 45, called thetwo-week treatment plan “laugh-able” as she bought grocer-ies nearby but was ambivalentabout whether Filner shouldstep down, partly because shewas puzzled why it took yearsfor some of the women to gopublic with detailed allegations.Filner’s problems began lessthan three weeks ago when a for-mer councilwoman and onetimeFilner supporter called for themayor to step down, saying shehad received credible evidencethat he had harassed women.On Monday, Filner’s for-mer communications director,Irene McCormack Jackson,became the ﬁrst woman to pub-licly identify herself as target of Filner. McCormack, who took a$50,000 annual pay cut to joinFilner’s inner circle in January,ﬁled a lawsuit claiming that themayor asked her to work with-out panties, demanded kisses,told her he wanted to see hernaked and dragged her in aheadlock while whispering inher ear. The other six women, whodescribed their experiences toKPBS News, include MorganRose, a psychologist for the SanDiego Uniﬁed School Districtwho said the then-congressmanrepeatedly tried to kiss her dur-ing a 2009 meeting to discusschild welfare.Veronica “Ronne” Froman, aretired rear admiral, said Filneronce blocked a doorway afterothers left a meeting, ran hisﬁnger up her cheek and askedif she had a man in her life.Froman, who is known in SanDiego as the “Navy Mayor” andhas led the American Red Crosslocal chapter, said the incidentoccurred a couple years ago atFilner’s congressional ofﬁce.Patti Roscoe, a businesswom-an in the tourism and hospitalityindustry who knew Filner beforehe was elected to Congress in1992, said Filner placed her in a“headlock” numerous times andtried to kiss her on the lips.“I’d have to squirm to getaway. And just as recently as afew months ago this happened.I turned and he just slobbereddown my chin,” Roscoe said.Filner, who is 70 and divorced,apologized earlier this month byreleasing a video statement inwhich he acknowledged disre-specting and sometimes intimi-dating women and said he wasseeking professional help, butFriday’s statement went further.“The behavior I have engagedin over many years is wrong,”he said at a nationally televisednews conference. “My failure torespect women and the intimi-dating conduct I engaged in attimes is inexcusable.\nSanDiegomayor’stherapyplanfopswithcritics\nTheAssociatedPress\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. — A sys-tem of thunderstorms acrosswestern North Carolina stalledon Saturday and dumped abouta foot of rain on the area, caus-ing power outages and ﬂashﬂoods that swamped homes andwashed out roads and bridges.

The cemeteryincludes 17 acres andmore than 16,000 buri-al sites, Brooks said.Included are more than600 Civil War veter-ans, many who becamefounders of local com-munities, prominentgovernment ofﬁcialsand creators of well-known businesses, hesaid.About 80 visitors tak-ing the tours saw grave-stones ranging from thevery tall and ornate totiny, almost unrecogniz-able slabs with the writ-ing weathered away.

He wasastounded at how manyCivil War veterans bur-ied there had returnedto Wilkes-Barre afterthe war to become localleaders.Most of all, he wasimpressed by the qual-ity of the workmanshipdemonstrated in thestones and monuments,many dating back tothe 1700s and 1800s.“These were hand-carved back then, notdone by machines likethey are now,” Slussersaid.Brooks said thecemetery is full, butthere are some plotsstill waiting for theiroccupants.

Through a Right to Knowrequest, the newspaper lastmonth sought the namesand addresses of delinquenttaxpayers and the amountsowed for 2011 and 2012.In a July 3 letter, thecity’s Open Records OfficerMargaret Sharksnas saidthe information sought was“confidential tax informa-tion” pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act and theLocal Taxpayers Bill of Rights. The act protects a broadrange of information frompublic disclosure, stating “any information gained by atax officer or any employeeor agent of a tax officer orof the tax collection commit-tee as a result of any declara-tions, returns, investigation,hearings or verificationsshall be confidential.”Sharksnas further statedthe state Office of OpenRecords previously heldthe names and addressesobtained from tax returns“are exempt from disclosureunder the LTEA.” The newspaper on July11 appealed the denial tothe Office of Open Records,which has 30 days to issue abinding final determination.Under the law, the burdenof proof that the records arenot subject to public accessrests with the city.Joe Butkiewicz, executiveeditor of The Times Leader,disagreed with the city’sdenial.“We think Times Leaderreaders and the people wholive and work in Wilkes-Barre have an interest inwho is failing to pay the citywage tax,” he said. “I don’tsee that information as adeclaration, return, investi-gation, hearing or verifica-tion.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

As the numbers and news stories continue to show, Obamacare is causing real pain for Americans across the country. In their own words, Ways and Means Members’ constituents and Americans across the country put these numbers and news stories into context to explain how Obamacare has impacted them personally:\nCancer Patients\n“Since [Obamacare] went into effect, the insurance choices and coverage have gotten lower and the costs have gotten higher. Virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance so I’m left to change doctors who I’ve seen for over 30 years and switch to “new” doctors who I don’t trust, and who cannot provide the same healthcare benefits I’ve received in the past. I have a brain tumor that I have monitored by a very skilled neuro-oncologist. Not anymore. The three choices I was given via Healthcare.gov aren’t even honored forms of insurance for this doctor.” — Kimberly K., Ohio\n“My wife and I [had] a Humana PPO health insurance plan in 2016 and it [was] discontinued on December 31st. We have been unable to find a comparable replacement for 2017. In our case we need a plan that includes MD Anderson Cancer Center in their network because she is undergoing treatments for Neuro Endocrine Tumors there. This is a rarer form of cancer and she needs the resources at that facility to effectively treat it. The monthly shots each cost $12,608. We always made sure we had health insurance but were forced to change because of the Obamacare legislation. Now the legislation has managed to limit the choices available to us.” — Craig S., Texas\nFamilies\n“Despite Obama’s promises, my plan was canceled at an affordable $450 a month when Obamacare was implemented. My new plan has gone up every year and for 2017 will be over $1,300 a month. My husband and I cannot keep up with these increases. Soon it will be a choice between food and housing or health care.” — Virginia Q., Florida\n“My doctor that I have been with 20+ years said that if me and my wife wanted to continue as patients then we would have to sign up and pay $5,000/per person to remain as her patient. That is a total of $10k/year. I had to find another doctor … My premiums have increased significantly and I am worried that the unique medical condition of my wife will not be covered.” — Duane J., Texas\n“My wife had a breast diagnosis scare that required a biopsy followed by a lumpectomy and numerous doctor visits and mass confusion between healthcare providers every step of the way. We have spent $24K this year for the poorest quality healthcare in our 40+ years of adulthood and if I need attention we will quickly hit $30K before the … insurance pays a dime.” — Geryk T., Texas\n“My health care premiums are now at $1528 for a family of 4 (silver 3000). Last year it was $1262.00. We started buying our family insurance in 2012 at $862.00. So it has doubled!!! … I looked at reducing the plan to a bronze 6000 but it would still be $1254 a month and you have to pay everything until you hit a $12,000 deductible. I would rather pay for 100% of my doctor visits and prescriptions and just buy catastrophic insurance but not for $1200 a month.” — Debbie L., Ohio\nMillennials\n“Last week I visited Healthcare.gov to scout out the most-affordable health-insurance plans I could buy for next year. In Arlington, Va., where I live and work, the cheapest option is $200 a month with a $6,850 deductible. Across the Potomac in D.C., the premiums are slightly cheaper but the deductible is still sky-high. My experience isn’t unique. ObamaCare is plainly unaffordable for many young Americans.” – David B., Virginia\nSelf-Employed Individuals\n“I don’t qualify for a subsidy. Plus, I help to pay a portion for those who do qualify for a subsidy. I am a working individual who happens to be self-employed … What were my 2017 options? None I would have ever picked. All HMOs. Minimal options. All are catastrophic plans. High costs/lackluster coverage. None of my existing doctors are in network. No coverage out of network. My premiums have increased from 2005 to 2017 by 165%. More importantly, out pocket maximum increased 2,420%.” — Ruth S., Arizona\n“I recently received my annual health insurance rate increase. My rates went up from $2,500 a month to over $3,750 per month. Last year’s increase was devastating. This year’s increase is even more overwhelming. I am self-employed and I liked the insurance I had only a short few years ago. This news is devastating to my family.” — Fred T., Pennsylvania\n“I’m self-employed and I’ve lost my insurance four times under Obamacare, twice because of Nebraska’s failed co-op. I recently had the grand adventure of going back to the exchange to find my fifth plan in four years. In Nebraska, we only have two insurance companies on the exchange now, and my deductible increased from $750 to $1,825. I went through hours of research and phone calls to find a plan with a lower deductible. One option required a $20,000 deductible if I wanted to keep my doctors. I drive seven hours roundtrip to see my doctors and get the procedures I need, and Obamacare continues to limit my choices for care.” — Pam W., Nebraska\nSmall Business Owners\n“As a small business owner, I recall the days before the ACA when we would receive a 2-inch notebook that contained multiple quotes from different health insurance companies. Now, our options are listed on a single legal sized sheet of paper. We only received three quotes for 2017, and just two of them were adequate for our region. In 2013, our insurance cost $180,000 for 92 lives with a $2,000 deductible. In 2016, we paid $252,000 for just 61 lives who face a $5,000 deductible. Our options are dwindling, our costs are skyrocketing, and our employees are ultimately suffering because of the ACA.” — Kathy H., Missouri\n“As an entrepreneur with two special needs children, the ACA is an expensive nightmare. Both my husband and I are small business owners and must pay for individual insurance. We are on the highest deductible plan offered to us, a monthly premium over $1000, and outstanding medical bills that we are struggling to pay off. We have seen our premium go up at least 14% and the expenses of care (lab) etc. With all the exceptions the president is offering to his corporate friends, it is people like us who are ignored.” — Edie M., Texas\n“I am a small businessman in Florence, SC. I have 6 people on payroll. The insurance premium increase this year is going from $1,268.07 to $1,676.91 per month with Blue Cross Blue Shield of SC … How should the small businessman afford insurance at the rate of $20,122.92 annually? … Based on our income, we do not qualify for discounted market place insurance. So I claim my income and pay my taxes and while I am doing the right thing, this is happening to our insurance premium.” — Anthony L., South Carolina\n“I am a small business owner and the cost of my insurance is to increase by up to 60%. I’ve already stopped using two medications due to cost and have an ongoing health condition that needs continued care, but I have been unable to see my provider due to cost. I never thought I would be in this position and I know I’m not alone.” — Barb B., Minnesota\nRetirees\n“I am 60 years old and a private, retired citizen. I have always had private insurance. Prior to 2016, I enjoyed a PPO, my doctors, Memorial Herman, and MD Anderson if I should have ever needed it. In 2016, my premiums went up, I lost my PPO, I lost my doctors, my hospital and MD Anderson if I should ever need it … In 2017, my premiums jumped 69.21% to $900 a month.

These policy changes build on the regulatory flexibilities granted under the President’s emergency declaration. CMS is expanding this benefit on a temporary and emergency basis under the 1135 waiver authority and Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act. The benefits are part of the broader effort by CMS and the White House Task Force to ensure that all Americans – particularly those at high-risk of complications from the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 – are aware of easy-to-use, accessible benefits that can help keep them healthy while helping to contain the community spread of this virus.\nTelehealth, telemedicine, and related terms generally refer to the exchange of medical information from one site to another through electronic communication to improve a patient’s health. Innovative uses of this kind of technology in the provision of healthcare is increasing. And with the emergence of the virus causing the disease COVID-19, there is an urgency to expand the use of technology to help people who need routine care, and keep vulnerable beneficiaries and beneficiaries with mild symptoms in their homes while maintaining access to the care they need. Limiting community spread of the virus, as well as limiting the exposure to other patients and staff members will slow viral spread.\nEXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH WITH 1135 WAIVER: Under this new waiver, Medicare can pay for office, hospital, and other visits furnished via telehealth across the country and including in patient’s places of residence starting March 6, 2020. A range of providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers, will be able to offer telehealth to their patients. Additionally, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) is providing flexibility for healthcare providers to reduce or waive cost-sharing for telehealth visits paid by federal healthcare programs.\nPrior to this waiver Medicare could only pay for telehealth on a limited basis: when the person receiving the service is in a designated rural area and when they leave their home and go to a clinic, hospital, or certain other types of medical facilities for the service.\nEven before the availability of this waiver authority, CMS made several related changes to improve access to virtual care. In 2019, Medicare started making payment for brief communications or Virtual Check-Ins, which are short patient-initiated communications with a healthcare practitioner. Medicare Part B separately pays clinicians for E-visits, which are non-face-to-face patient-initiated communications through an online patient portal.\nMedicare beneficiaries will be able to receive a specific set of services through telehealth including evaluation and management visits (common office visits), mental health counseling and preventive health screenings. This will help ensure Medicare beneficiaries, who are at a higher risk for COVID-19, are able to visit with their doctor from their home, without having to go to a doctor’s office or hospital which puts themselves and others at risk.\nTYPES OF VIRTUAL SERVICES:\nThere are three main types of virtual services physicians and other professionals can provide to Medicare beneficiaries summarized in this fact sheet: Medicare telehealth visits, virtual check-ins and e-visits.\nMEDICARE TELEHEALTH VISITS: Currently, Medicare patients may use telecommunication technology for office, hospital visits and other services that generally occur in-person.\n- The provider must use an interactive audio and video telecommunications system that permits real-time communication between the distant site and the patient at home. Distant site practitioners who can furnish and get payment for covered telehealth services (subject to state law) can include physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse midwives, certified nurse anesthetists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, registered dietitians, and nutrition professionals.\n- It is imperative during this public health emergency that patients avoid travel, when possible, to physicians’ offices, clinics, hospitals, or other health care facilities where they could risk their own or others’ exposure to further illness. Accordingly, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a policy of enforcement discretion for Medicare telehealth services furnished pursuant to the waiver under section 1135(b)(8) of the Act. To the extent the waiver (section 1135(g)(3)) requires that the patient have a prior established relationship with a particular practitioner, HHS will not conduct audits to ensure that such a prior relationship existed for claims submitted during this public health emergency.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n- Effective for services starting March 6, 2020 and for the duration of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, Medicare will make payment for Medicare telehealth services furnished to patients in broader circumstances.\n- These visits are considered the same as in-person visits and are paid at the same rate as regular, in-person visits.\n- Starting March 6, 2020 and for the duration of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, Medicare will make payment for professional services furnished to beneficiaries in all areas of the country in all settings.\n- While they must generally travel to or be located in certain types of originating sites such as a physician’s office, skilled nursing facility or hospital for the visit, effective for services starting March 6, 2020 and for the duration of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, Medicare will make payment for Medicare telehealth services furnished to beneficiaries in any healthcare facility and in their home.\n- The Medicare coinsurance and deductible would generally apply to these services. However, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) is providing flexibility for healthcare providers to reduce or waive cost-sharing for telehealth visits paid by federal healthcare programs.\n- To the extent the 1135 waiver requires an established relationship, HHS will not conduct audits to ensure that such a prior relationship existed for claims submitted during this public health emergency.\nVIRTUAL CHECK-INS: In all areas (not just rural), established Medicare patients in their home may have a brief communication service with practitioners via a number of communication technology modalities including synchronous discussion over a telephone or exchange of information through video or image. We expect that these virtual services will be initiated by the patient; however, practitioners may need to educate beneficiaries on the availability of the service prior to patient initiation.\nMedicare pays for these “virtual check-ins” (or Brief communication technology-based service) for patients to communicate with their doctors and avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor’s office. These virtual check-ins are for patients with an established (or existing) relationship with a physician or certain practitioners where the communication is not related to a medical visit within the previous 7 days and does not lead to a medical visit within the next 24 hours (or soonest appointment available). The patient must verbally consent to receive virtual check-in services. The Medicare coinsurance and deductible would generally apply to these services.\nDoctors and certain practitioners may bill for these virtual check in services furnished through several communication technology modalities, such as telephone (HCPCS code G2012). The practitioner may respond to the patient’s concern by telephone, audio/video, secure text messaging, email, or use of a patient portal. Standard Part B cost sharing applies to both. In addition, separate from these virtual check-in services, captured video or images can be sent to a physician (HCPCS code G2010).\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n- Virtual check-in services can only be reported when the billing practice has an established relationship with the patient.\n- This is not limited to only rural settings or certain locations.\n- Individual services need to be agreed to by the patient; however, practitioners may educate beneficiaries on the availability of the service prior to patient agreement.\n- HCPCS code G2012: Brief communication technology-based service, e.g. virtual check-in, by a physician or other qualified health care professional who can report evaluation and management services, provided to an established patient, not originating from a related e/m service provided within the previous 7 days nor leading to an e/m service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment; 5-10 minutes of medical discussion.\n- HCPCS code G2010: Remote evaluation of recorded video and/or images submitted by an established patient (e.g., store and forward), including interpretation with follow-up with the patient within 24 business hours, not originating from a related e/m service provided within the previous 7 days nor leading to an e/m service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment.\n- Virtual check-ins can be conducted with a broader range of communication methods, unlike Medicare telehealth visits, which require audio and visual capabilities for real-time communication.\nE-VISITS: In all types of locations including the patient’s home, and in all areas (not just rural), established Medicare patients may have non-face-to-face patient-initiated communications with their doctors without going to the doctor’s office by using online patient portals. These services can only be reported when the billing practice has an established relationship with the patient. For these E-Visits, the patient must generate the initial inquiry and communications can occur over a 7-day period. The services may be billed using CPT codes 99421-99423 and HCPCS codes G2061-G2063, as applicable. The patient must verbally consent to receive virtual check-in services. The Medicare coinsurance and deductible would apply to these services.\nMedicare Part B also pays for E-visits or patient-initiated online evaluation and management conducted via a patient portal. Practitioners who may independently bill Medicare for evaluation and management visits (for instance, physicians and nurse practitioners) can bill the following codes:\n- 99421: Online digital evaluation and management service, for an established patient, for up to 7 days, cumulative time during the 7 days; 5–10 minutes\n- 99422: Online digital evaluation and management service, for an established patient, for up to 7 days cumulative time during the 7 days; 11– 20 minutes\n- 99423: Online digital evaluation and management service, for an established patient, for up to 7 days, cumulative time during the 7 days; 21 or more minutes.\nClinicians who may not independently bill for evaluation and management visits (for example – physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, clinical psychologists) can also provide these e-visits and bill the following codes:\n- G2061: Qualified non-physician healthcare professional online assessment and management, for an established patient, for up to seven days, cumulative time during the 7 days; 5–10 minutes\n- G2062: Qualified non-physician healthcare professional online assessment and management service, for an established patient, for up to seven days, cumulative time during the 7 days; 11–20 minutes\n- G2063: Qualified non-physician qualified healthcare professional assessment and management service, for an established patient, for up to seven days, cumulative time during the 7 days; 21 or more minutes.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n- These services can only be reported when the billing practice has an established relationship with the patient.\n- This is not limited to only rural settings. There are no geographic or location restrictions for these visits.\n- Patients communicate with their doctors without going to the doctor’s office by using online patient portals.\n- Individual services need to be initiated by the patient; however, practitioners may educate beneficiaries on the availability of the service prior to patient initiation.\n- The services may be billed using CPT codes 99421-99423 and HCPCS codes G2061-G206, as applicable.\n- The Medicare coinsurance and deductible would generally apply to these services.\nHEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA): Effective immediately, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will exercise enforcement discretion and waive penalties for HIPAA violations against health care providers that serve patients in good faith through everyday communications technologies, such as FaceTime or Skype, during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency.

Virtually every country in the world is experiencing growth in the number and proportion of older persons in their population.\nThe world’s population is expected to keep growing for another 50 or 60 years, peaking at around 10.3 billion in the mid-2080s, up from 8.2 billion in 2024, before declining gradually to 10.2 billion in 2100, according to the World Population Prospects 2024\nThe probability of this peak occurring within the century is quite high -estimated at 80%, a significant increase from 30% in 2013-. The population in 2100 is now expected to be about 700 million fewer than previous forecasts, largely due to lower-than-expected fertility rates in major countries, particularly China.\nBy 2080, people aged 65 and over will outnumber children under 18\nBy the late 2070s, the global population aged 65 and older is projected to reach 2.2 billion, surpassing the number of children under age 18. By the mid-2030s, there will be 265 million individuals aged 80 and older, outnumbering infants. Even rapidly growing nations will experience a rise in the elderly population over the next 30 years. Those nations will need to prepare for significant demographic changes by strengthening health and long-term care systems, ensuring social protection sustainability, and investing in new technologies.\nGiven that women generally live longer than men, policies must ensure equitable access to retirement benefits, address gender-specific healthcare needs, and bolster social support systems to alleviate caregiving burdens.\nMigration as a driver of population growth\nIn 50 countries, immigration is expected to mitigate population decline due to low fertility and an aging population. For countries such as Italy, Germany and the Russian Federation, where the population has already peaked, the peak would have occurred earlier without immigration. By 2054, immigration will drive population growth in 52 countries, including Australia, Canada, and the USA, and in 62 by 2100.\nWhile emigration generally has little effect, in 14 countries with ultra-low fertility, it will significantly contribute to population loss. In nations with fertility below replacement levels, encouraging decent work and return migration may be more effective in slowing population decline than policies aimed at increasing fertility.\nLife expectancy returning to pre-COVID-19 levels\nSince 2022, global life expectancy has returned to levels before COVID-19. In 2023, fewer than 5 million children under age 5 died for the first time. This improvement mainly happened in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan, which are expected to grow in population through 2054.\nLife expectancy at birth reached 73.3 years in 2024, with further reductions in mortality expected to result in an average global life expectancy of around 77.4 years in 2054.\nBetter life expectancy should help increase population growth or slow decline in most areas, especially where death rates are going down, along with some immigration.\nDid you know?\n- In 63 countries and areas – containing 28 per cent of the world’s population in 2024 – the size of the population peaked before 2024. This group includes China, Germany, Japan and the Russian Federation.\n- By the late 2030s, half of the women in countries with populations that have already peaked will be too old to have children by natural means.\n- In 2024, 4.7 million babies, or about 3.5 per cent of the total worldwide, were born to mothers under age 18. Of these, some 340,000 were born to girls under age 15, with serious adverse consequences for the health and well-being of both the young mothers and their children.\n- The number of women in the reproductive age range, which is about 15 to 49 years old, is expected to increase until the late 2050s. It will likely reach around 2.2 billion, up from nearly 2.0 billion in 2024.\n- In countries with young populations, investment in education, health and infrastructure, along with reforms to promote decent work opportunities and improve government transparency and efficiency, is vital to ensure this opportunity isn't wasted.\n- Raising the minimum legal age at marriage and integrating family planning and safe motherhood measures into primary health care can help to raise women’s levels of education, facilitate their economic participation and reduce the incidence of early childbearing.\nKey Conferences on Ageing\nTo begin addressing these issues, the General Assembly convened the first World Assembly on Ageing in 1982, which produced a 62-point Vienna International Plan of Action on Ageing. It called for specific action on such issues as health and nutrition, protecting elderly consumers, housing and environment, family, social welfare, income security and employment, education, and the collection and analysis of research data.\nIn 1991, the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Principles for Older Persons, enumerating 18 entitlements for older persons — relating to independence, participation, care, self-fulfillment and dignity. The following year, the International Conference on Ageing met to follow-up on the Plan of Action, adopting a Proclamation on Ageing. Following the Conference's recommendation, the UN General Assembly declared 1999 the International Year of Older Persons. The International Day of Older Persons is celebrated on 1 October every year.\nAction on behalf of the ageing continued in 2002 when the Second World Assembly on Ageing was held in Madrid. Aiming to design international policy on ageing for the 21st century, it adopted a Political Declaration and the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. The Plan of Action called for changes in attitudes, policies and practices at all levels to fulfil the enormous potential of ageing in the twenty-first century. Its specific recommendations for action give priority to older persons and development, advancing health and well-being into old age, and ensuring enabling and supportive environments.\nResources\n- International Day of Older Persons\n- World Population Prospects\n- DESA United Nations Programme on Ageing\n- UNFPA Ageing\n- Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons\n- United Nations principles for older persons\n- Tackling abuse of older people: five priorities for the United Nations decade of healthy ageing (2021–2030)\n- Ageism in artificial intelligence for health\n- Ageism is a global challenge: UN\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

It uses a federal information-sharing partnership between DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that helps to identify in-custody aliens without imposing new or additional requirements on state and local law enforcement. For decades, local jurisdictions have shared the fingerprints of individuals arrested and/or booked into custody with the FBI to see if those individuals have a criminal record and outstanding warrants. Under Secure Communities, the FBI automatically sends the fingerprints to DHS to check against its immigration databases. If these checks reveal that an individual is unlawfully present in the United States or otherwise removable, ICE takes enforcement action – prioritizing the removal of individuals who present the most significant threats to public safety as determined by the severity of their crime, their criminal history, and risk to public safety – as well as those who have violated the nation’s immigration laws.\nThe federal government, not the state or local law enforcement agency, determines what immigration enforcement action, if any, is appropriate.\nOnly federal DHS officers make immigration enforcement decisions, and they do so only after an individual is arrested for a criminal violation of local, state, or federal law, separate and apart from any violations of immigration law.\nThe Basics\nICE completed full implementation of Secure Communities to all 3,181 jurisdictions within 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. Territories on January 22, 2013. While the biometric interoperability has remained constant since full implementation was achieved, ICE’s operational posture under Secure Communities was temporarily suspended by DHS policy from November 20, 2014, through January 25, 2017.\nSince its reactivation on January 25, 2017 through the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, as a result of Executive Order No. 13768, entitled Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States, more than 43,300 convicted criminal aliens have been removed as a result of Secure Communities.\nHow Does Secure Communities Work?\nThrough the aforementioned Executive Order, DHS has been provided clear and common-sense priorities for immigration enforcement focused on the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, as passed by the Congress. Secure Communities will utilize all available data systems and Criminal Alien Program resources to identify and take enforcement actions (to include the lodging of detainers) against criminal and other priority aliens while they are in the custody of another law enforcement or correctional agency. This will prevent their release back into the community, and thus stop the cycle of recidivism perpetrated by many of these criminal and immigration offenders.\nSecure Communities had a long and successful history prior to its suspension as indicated above. In fact, from its inception in 2008 through FY14 and since its reactivation on January 25, 2017 through the end of FY 2017, Secure Communities interoperability led to the removal of over 363,400 criminal aliens from the U.S.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat is Secure Communities?\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) prioritizes its enforcement efforts on the arrest and removal of public safety and national security threats, those who have violated our nation’s immigration laws, including those who have failed to comply with a final order of removal, and those who have engaged in fraud/willful misrepresentation in connection with official government matters. Secure Communities is a simple and common sense tool that helps ICE effectuate these priorities. Utilizing a federal information-sharing partnership between ICE and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Secure Communities helps to identify removable aliens who have been arrested and booked for violations of criminal law.\nUnder Secure Communities, the FBI, as mandated by statute, automatically sends these fingerprints to DHS to check against its immigration databases. If these checks reveal that an individual may be unlawfully present in the United States or otherwise removable due to a criminal conviction, ICE determines what, if any, enforcement action to take – prioritizing the removal of those individuals who present the most significant threats to public safety as determined by the severity of their crime, their criminal history, and other factors, as well as those who have violated immigration laws. The federal government, not the state or local law enforcement agency, determines what immigration enforcement action, if any, is appropriate.\nHow does Secure Communities work?\nWhen state and local law enforcement officers arrest and book someone into custody for a violation of a criminal offense, they generally fingerprint the person. After fingerprints are taken, the state and local authorities submit the fingerprints to the FBI. The FBI runs these fingerprints through its database of criminal records and sends the state and local authorities a record of the person's criminal history.\nUnder Secure Communities, DHS receives these fingerprints from the FBI so that ICE can determine if that person is also subject to removal (deportation). This process fulfills a 2002 Congressional mandate for federal law enforcement agencies to share information that is relevant to determine the admissibility or deportability of an alien. (See 8 U.S.C. § 1722(a)(2).)\nICE generally relies on biometric confirmation of the alien’s identity and a records check of federal databases that affirmatively indicate, by themselves or in addition to other reliable information or statements made by the alien to an immigration officer, and/or the reliable evidence that affirmatively indicates the alien either lacks immigration status, or, notwithstanding such status, is removable under U.S. immigration law.\nIn cases where ICE has probable cause of removability, ICE typically issues a detainer, requesting that the state or local jail facility hold the individual up to 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) to allow ICE to assume custody.\nWhat are the benefits of Secure Communities?\nICE's enforcement priorities include the identification and removal of criminal aliens, other aliens who pose a threat to public safety, and aliens who have violated our nation's immigration laws. The most effective way to identify such aliens is by checking the immigration status of individuals arrested and booked into custody for violations of criminal laws.\nUnder Secure Communities, DHS receives this information from the FBI, determines the individual's immigration status, and then makes a decision about what immigration enforcement action, if any, should be taken. By focusing on individuals who have been arrested and booked into custody for alleged violations of criminal laws, Secure Communities has proven to be one of ICE's most important tools for identifying and removing criminal aliens as well as repeat immigration violators. However, that is not the only benefit of Secure Communities. Other benefits include:\n- Secure Communities is designed to ensure that the responsibility of immigration enforcement remains with federal officials. It does not authorize or permit state or local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law.\n- Information is shared in near real time and is based on biometrics - in this case, fingerprints, which are accurate, reliable, and virtually impossible to forge.\nCan a state or local law enforcement agency choose not to have fingerprints it submits to the FBI checked against DHS' system?\nThis question has been asked in many contexts, and it is important to clarify that the information-sharing partnership between DHS and the FBI that is the cornerstone of Secure Communities is mandated by federal law, which means that state and local jurisdictions cannot prohibit information-sharing between agencies in this respect. The fingerprints state and local law enforcement submit to the FBI to be checked against the DOJ's biometric identification system for criminal history records are automatically sent to DHS's biometric system to check against its immigration and law enforcement records. The United States government has determined that a jurisdiction cannot choose to have the fingerprints it submits to the federal government processed only for criminal history checks. Further, jurisdictions cannot ask that the identifications that result from DHS's processing of the fingerprints not be shared with local ICE field offices in that jurisdiction. It is ICE, and not the state or local law enforcement agency, that determines what immigration enforcement action, if any, is appropriate.\nHow will ICE ensure victims of domestic violence and other crimes are protected?\nICE developed a policy specifically to protect victims of domestic violence and other crimes and to ensure these crimes continue to be reported and prosecuted. This policy directs all ICE officers and attorneys to exercise appropriate discretion to ensure victims of and witnesses to crimes are not penalized by removal.\nWhat protocols are in place to monitor state and local conduct to guard against profiling?\nDHS and ICE take allegations of racial profiling and other complaints relating to civil rights and civil liberties violations very seriously, and have created a complaint system whereby individuals or organizations who believe civil rights violations have occurred can file a complaint.\nFormal allegations are referred to the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), which is tasked with guarding against violations in DHS programs. ICE fully supports all CRCL investigations, including taking action to ensure witnesses and complainants are able to remain in the United States.\nAdditionally, in all ICE detention facilities, ICE prominently advertises a 24-hour phone number for those who feel they have been the targets of racial or ethnic profiling and ensures complaints are transmitted to CRCL, the Department of Justice, or other appropriate office.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Failing to do so would be an unprecedented dereliction of duty.\nThe Senate has almost a full year to consider and confirm a nominee. In fact, since 1975, the average time from nomination to confirmation is 67 days. The longest time before confirmation in the past three decades was 99 days, for Justice Thomas, and the last four Justices, spanning two Administrations, were confirmed in an average of 75 days.\nThe Facts\nSix Justices have been confirmed in a presidential election year since 1900.\nEvery nominee who was not withdrawn has received a vote within 125 days of nomination.\nIt will be harmful and create unsustainable uncertainty if Congress fails to act on the President's nominee.\nHere's a look at where President Obama's Supreme Court nominee stands in the confirmation process compared to those of recent nominees under three different administrations.\nSCOTUS FAQ\nRead the FAQs\nQ: Has Judge Garland issued opinions hostile to gun owners?\nA: No. Chief Judge Garland has never issued or joined an opinion involving the Second Amendment.\nSome right-wing special interest groups are spending millions of dollars trying to distort Judge Garland’s record by misrepresenting his votes in two cases. Independent fact-checkers have already deemed those attacks “false,” but let’s look at the facts. In 2008, a D.C. Circuit panel that did not include Chief Judge Garland struck down parts of a Washington, D.C. gun control law in Parker v. District of Columbia, a decision that was eventually affirmed by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller. Chief Judge Garland joined one of President George H.W. Bush’s appointees and two other judges in voting to grant rehearing by the full court.\nA vote for rehearing by the full court is simply a request to have more judges take a look at the legal matter.\nJudge Garland’s vote to request rehearing does not indicate anything about his views on the Second Amendment. The D.C. Circuit’s rules say that rehearing by the full court is only appropriate in certain circumstances, such as where the case involves a question of exceptional importance.\nAs Chief Justice Roberts explained at his confirmation hearing, there are many reasons judges vote for rehearing, including that a case involves important questions that the court “ought to look at” more closely. This case was the first federal court decision to strike down a statute on Second Amendment grounds in decades. Chief Judge Garland was also on the D.C. Circuit when it denied full court rehearing in Heller II, a September 2015 panel decision invalidating various portions of a new D.C. gun control law under the Second Amendment.\nThe second case, the 2000 decision in NRA v. Reno, does not reflect any views on the Second Amendment, but rather Chief Judge Garland’s careful case-by-case approach to judging. This case was about a Justice Department regulation that allowed the Department to temporarily retain certain data generated during background checks of prospective firearms purchasers that are required by federal law. The Department kept the data for a limited period to review the background system to ensure accuracy and privacy. Garland voted with the majority to uphold the regulation, in an opinion that concluded that the Department had reasonably interpreted the Brady Act to permit retaining the data temporarily to conduct audits. The D.C. Circuit emphasized that the audit records did not represent a “system for the registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions” and that the creation of any such system would be barred by statute. The case was about administrative law and did not mention the Second Amendment.\nChief Judge Garland is a balanced judge who approaches every case with an open mind. In fact, many conservative voices – including an NRA attorney -- agree:\n-\nPresident George W. Bush’s judicial nominee Miguel Estrada has said, “The evidence that is being cited for the accusation that Judge Garland has some bias against Second Amendment rights is from thin to nonexistent.”\n-\nIndependent fact-checker Politifact looked at the claim about D.C’s gun laws and found that: \"Garland never heard the case about Washington gun laws from the bench, and so he never voted on it.\"\n-\nNRA Attorney Charles Cooper wrote that his \"high opinion of Judge Garland has not changed — indeed, it has only strengthened — over the course of the 19 years since I wrote these words. The qualities that I saw in Merrick Garland as a nominee to the D.C. Circuit have been displayed in abundance by Judge Garland as a member of that court.”\n-\nRenowned Second Amendment defender, Senator Orrin Hatch called Chief Judge Garland “a fine man” and “a consensus nominee,” continuing to praise him long after these cases were heard.\nJudge Garland’s long record as the most well-respected judge on the nation’s most important appeals court illustrates that he is a careful, thoughtful judge who shows respect for both the rule of law and its impact of the law on the lives of ordinary Americans. He’s issued opinions that have garnered support from colleagues appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents, and he will no doubt continue to be a consensus-builder when he begins serving on the Supreme Court.\nQ: Who was involved in the selection process?\nA: Brian Deese, Senior Advisor to the President, and White House Counsel Neil Eggleston oversaw a broad process that involved other key members of the President’s team such as Valerie Jarrett, Senior Advisor to the President. Over the course of this past month, the White House consulted Senate leadership, other members of Congress, leaders of the bar, and a broad array of other stakeholders. But at the end of the day, it was the President who made this decision. Over the last month, he considered many excellent, highly qualified candidates with diverse backgrounds and varied life experiences. From those candidates, the President selected the person he believes is best for the job. That candidate is Chief Judge Garland.\nQ: Has the President normally taken this much time to choose a Supreme Court nominee?\nA: It has only been a month since Justice Scalia unexpectedly passed away. That is about as long as the President took to nominate his two previous nominees for the Supreme Court. The President has made clear he takes this process extremely seriously and wanted to balance his goal of moving swiftly with ensuring he nominated an excellent, highly qualified nominee. In that time, the President considered many qualified candidates with diverse backgrounds and varied life experiences. From those candidates, the President selected the person he believes is best for the job. That candidate is Chief Judge Garland.\nIn addition, over the last four decades, the US Senate has taken, on average, 67 days to confirm a President's nominee to the Supreme Court. It's currently mid-March. That means, there is ample time for the Senate to consider Judge Garland's nomination and confirm him to the Supreme Court before the next SCOTUS term starts at the beginning of October.\nQ: Will Chief Judge Garland have a hearing in the Senate?\nA: Now that the President has fulfilled his constitutional responsibility to nominate someone who is highly qualified to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, he looks forward to the Senate doing its job of holding a hearing and allowing members to vote on the nominee. That’s what is written in the Constitution and what the American people expect and deserve.\nQ: Will Chief Judge Garland get confirmed?\nA: Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution clearly spells out how the confirmation process is supposed to work. The President took that constitutional responsibility seriously, consulting with both Democratic and Republican Senators and even inviting them to put forward potential nominees for his consideration. The result of his consultations and rigorous process is the decision to nominate a thoughtful, meticulous, moderate judge for the Supreme Court with a keen ability for building consensus.\nChief Judge Merrick Garland was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit Court\nThe President fully expects Congress to honor their constitutional responsibility and allow this nominee a hearing and a vote. Despite repeated declarations that they will ignore such a responsibility, the President believes there will be enough Republicans listening to Americans and editorial boards across the country to honor their oath of office and do their job regardless of their party’s political leadership.\nSCOTUS Quote\n“\nJudge Garland is a preeminent member of the legal profession with outstanding legal ability and exceptional breadth of experience. He meets the highest standards of integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament. It is the unanimous opinion of the Standing Committee that Judge Garland is “Well Qualified” to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n”\nThe nonpartisan American Bar Association\nSCOTUS Validators\nWhat They've Said\n“Everybody is pretty much unanimous that by temperament, experience, and background, he is a very suitable person for the Supreme Court. The argument about the vacancy isn't entirely political.”\nMiguel Estrada,\na conservative judicial nominee appointed by Pres. George W. Bush\n“\"[My] high opinion of Judge Garland has not changed — indeed, it has only strengthened...The qualities that I saw in Merrick Garland as a nominee to the D.C. Circuit have been displayed in abundance by Judge Garland as a member of that Court.”\nCharles Cooper,\nLawyer for the National Rifle Association\nRead the quote in context.\n“I can hardly imagine how one could mount a personal attack against Judge Garland.”\nMichael Chertoff,\nSecretary of Homeland Security under Pres. George W. Bush\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        WHEREAS:\nIt is the obligation of the President of the United States, under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, to nominate Supreme Court justices. Further, it is the constitutional obligation of members of the U.S. Senate to provide “advice and consent” to these nominations, by holding hearings and taking votes to determine the nominees’ fitness to serve on the court; and\nWHEREAS:\nWithin hours of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee had announced that they would not hold hearings on any Supreme Court nomination made by President Obama, nor would they even offer a courtesy meeting to a nominee. This refusal prior to any nomination by the President indicates that it is not in reaction to the qualifications or ideology of a nominee; but clearly an attempt to block the President’s power to make judicial nominations, disregarding the crucial constitutional concept of separation of powers, and politicizing and crippling our judicial system; and\nWHEREAS:\nPresident Obama has nominated Judge Merrick Garland to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy. An experienced jurist with impeccable credentials, Judge Garland is the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Prior to serving on the appellate court, Garland supervised the prosecution of domestic terrorism cases at the U.S. Department of Justice, including those of Timothy McVeigh and Ted Kaczynski. Garland has received praise from many prominent Republicans, including Ken Starr, who served as U.S. Solicitor General under President George W. Bush, calling him “superbly qualified to serve on our nation’s highest court.” Still, Senate Republicans refuse to hold a hearing on his nomination; and\nWHEREAS:\nRepublican senators’ publicized reasoning that there is precedent for refusing to consider judicial nominations in an election year is patently false. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Reagan nominee, was confirmed unanimously by a Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate in 1988, proving that it is possible for a Senate majority opposing a sitting President to disregard partisan politics and focus\non judicial qualifications when it chooses to do so. Indeed, every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 has had a hearing or a vote; and\nWHEREAS:\nThe refusal by Republican senators to do their constitutional duty has left the Supreme Court unable to definitively decide monumental cases involving affirmative action, abortion, immigration and labor rights. Without a ninth justice, the court can only uphold a lower court ruling for the time being, if it makes a 4-4 split decision. We need a ninth justice to make decisions establishing the rule of law on issues of fundamental importance to the American people; and\nWHEREAS:\nThis obstructionism is not limited to the U.S. Supreme Court, but extends to nominees throughout the federal judicial system. In January of 2015, there were 12 pending judicial nominees to federal courts that were awaiting consideration by the U.S. Senate; and by January of 2016, that number had grown to 54 nominees who were being denied a hearing. Further, the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts has stated that this obstruction has resulted in 30 judicial emergencies, defined as vacancies longer than 18 months or in jurisdictions with excessive filings – up from 12 such emergency situations in January of 2015. These judicial emergencies mean that ordinary Americans are being denied their day in court due to the backlog of cases; and\nWHEREAS:\nAn overwhelming 69% majority of Americans say that Senate Republicans should consider President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, and take an up-or-down vote. Even staunchly conservative, pro-business publications such as Fortune Magazine have called for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings as soon as possible on the Garland nomination.\nBE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED:\nThat AFSCME demands members of the Senate Judiciary Committee do their job by immediately holding hearings on Judge Merrick Garland’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, followed by an up-or-down vote in the U.S. Senate on the nominee; and\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED:\nThat AFSCME demands members of the Senate Judiciary Committee do their job by proceeding without further delay on hearings for federal judicial nominees awaiting consideration; and\nBE IT FINALLY RESOLVED:\nThat AFSCME will educate voters in the 2016 elections about the harm brought about by judicial obstruction, and will hold accountable those members of the U.S. Senate who have tried to deny justice to the American people.\nSUBMITTED BY: INTERNATIONAL EXECUTIVE BOARD\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Clone of SCOTUS Nomination\nPresident Obama’s\nSupreme Court Nomination\nWhat They’ve Said\nConservative Voices\n“Everybody is pretty much unanimous that by temperament, experience, and background, he is a very suitable person for the Supreme Court.

That’s their job.”\nRichard Painter,\nChief Ethics Lawyer for Pres. George W.

He was uniformly courteous and considerate and demonstrated great skill, perseverance and learning.”\nStephen Jones,\nRepublican Attorney for Timothy McVeigh\n3/16/16\n“For what it’s worth, were I in the Senate I would vote to confirm Garland to the Supreme Court, but I’ve always supported the prompt consideration and confirmation of all qualified judicial nominees.”\nJonathan Adler,\nconservative professor at Case Western University School of Law\n3/16/16\n“He's the best scenario we could hope for to bring the tension and the politics in the city down a notch for the summer.”\nCarrie Severino,\nChief Counsel and Polity Director to the Judicial Crisis Network\nRead the quote in context.\nLegal Experts\n“There is no principled or legitimate justification for the Senate Republicans to suddenly depart from this sensible and well-settled practice. Judges, lawyers, senators and scholars from across the political spectrum agree that Garland is exceptionally well-qualified, unquestionably ethical and reasonably moderate in his jurisprudence.”\nGeoffrey Stone,\nLaw Professor at University of Chicago\n3/28/16\n“Like a tumor invading an otherwise healthy organ, the Senate majority party’s decision to withhold consideration of President Obama’s nominee to fill the seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, threatens to severely cripple the operations of the Supreme Court.”\nJames Nelson,\nformer Montana Supreme Court Justice\n3/30/16\n“He is an extraordinarily capable lawyer, in part because he is so good at finding common ground with his colleagues, which is one of the things that made him appeal to President Obama.”\nLaurence Tribe,\nProfessor at Harvard Law\n3/28/16\nLeading Advocates\n“Judge Garland earned high marks from law enforcement.

Al Sharpton\n“Judge Garland is an intelligent, highly accomplished judge who has secured bipartisan support in his previous appointments.”\nCecile Richards,\nPresident of Planned Parenthood Action Fund\n“Judge Garland is the most well-prepared Supreme Court nominee in generations. From Supreme Court clerk, to the Justice Department, to the private sector, to overseeing the prosecutions of the Oklahoma City bombers, to Chief Judge of the D.C.

Of the six justices confirmed since 1900, three have been Republicans.

It'd be unprecedented for the Court to go that long with an empty seat. Here's why it's harmful:\nThe Court’s 4-4 decisions have no value in establishing precedent on which future decisions can rely. They also cannot establish uniform nationwide rules. That means if multiple courts ruled differently on an issue before it arose at the Supreme Court, a 4-4 ruling would leave those different rules in place in different states. The result is an unsustainable uncertainty — for the law, for individual liberties, and for our economy.\nSpread the Word\nSince 1900, six justices have been confirmed in a presidential election year, including President Reagan-appointee Justice Kennedy.\nThe President's Supreme Court Nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland: More federal experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history.

We created more than 22-million new jobs, moved 8-million people out of poverty, and turned our economy around.\n        Subject(s): economy\n        Speaker: bill-clinton\n        Speaker's Job Title: former president\n        State Info: Arkansas\n        Party Affiliation: democrat\n        Barely-True: 4\n        False: 2\n        Half-True: 12\n        Mostly-True: 11\n        Pants-Fire: 3\n        Context: \n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        |\nIn 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore launched their economic strategy: (1) establishing\nfiscal discipline, eliminating the budget deficit, keeping interest rates low, and spurring private-sector\ninvestment; (2) investing in people through education, training, science, and research; and (3) opening foreign\nmarkets so American workers can compete abroad. After eight years, the results of President Clinton's economic\nleadership are clear. Record budget deficits have become record surpluses, 22 million new jobs have been\ncreated, unemployment and core inflation are at their lowest levels in more than 30 years, and America is in the\nmidst of the longest economic expansion in our history.\nPresident Clinton's Record on the Economy: In 1992, 10 million Americans were unemployed, the\ncountry faced record deficits, and poverty and welfare rolls were growing. Family incomes were losing ground\nto inflation and jobs were being created at the slowest rate since the Great Depression. Today, America enjoys\nwhat may be the strongest economy ever.\n-\nStrong Economic Growth: Since President Clinton and Vice President Gore took office, economic growth has\naveraged 4.0 percent per year, compared to average growth of 2.8 percent during the Reagan-Bush years.\nThe economy has grown for 116 consecutive months, the most in history.\n-\nMost New Jobs Ever Created Under a Single Administration: The economy has created more than 22.5 million jobs\nin less than eight yearsthe most jobs ever created under a single administration, and more than were\ncreated in the previous 12 years. Of the total new jobs, 20.7 million, or 92 percent, are in the private\nsector.\n-\nMedian Family Income Up $6,000 since 1993: Economic gains have been made across the spectrum as family incomes\nincreased for all Americans. Since 1993, real median family income has increased by $6,338, from $42,612 in\n1993 to $48,950 in 1999 (in 1999 dollars).\n-\nUnemployment at Its Lowest Level in More than 30 Years: Overall unemployment has dropped to the lowest level\nin more than 30 years, down from 6.9 percent in 1993 to just 4.0 percent in November 2000. The unemployment\nrate has been below 5 percent for 40 consecutive months. Unemployment for African Americans has fallen from\n14.2 percent in 1992 to 7.3 percent in October 2000, the lowest rate on record. Unemployment for Hispanics\nhas fallen from 11.8 percent in October 1992 to 5.0 percent in October 2000, also the lowest rate on record.\n-\nLowest Inflation since the 1960s: Inflation is at the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, averaging\n2.5 percent, and it is down from 4.7 percent during the previous administration.\n-\nHighest Homeownership Rate on Record: The homeownership rate reached 67.7 percent for the third quarter of\n2000, the highest rate on record. In contrast, the homeownership rate fell from 65.6 percent in the first\nquarter of 1981 to 63.7 percent in the first quarter of 1993.\n-\n7 Million Fewer Americans Living in Poverty: The poverty rate has declined from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 11.8\npercent last year, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. There are now 7 million fewer\npeople in poverty than there were in 1993.\nEstablishing Fiscal Discipline and Paying off the National Debt\nPresident Clinton's Record on Fiscal Discipline: Between 1981 and 1992, the national debt held by\nthe public quadrupled. The annual budget deficit grew to $290 billion in 1992, the largest ever, and was\nprojected to grow to more than $455 billion by Fiscal Year (FY) 2000. As a result of the tough and sometimes\nunpopular choices made by President Clinton, and major deficit reduction legislation passed in 1993 and 1997, we\nhave seen eight consecutive years of fiscal improvement for the first time in America's history.\n-\nLargest Surplus Ever: The surplus in FY 2000 is $237 billionthe third consecutive surplus and the\nlargest surplus ever.\n-\nLargest Three-Year Debt Pay-Down Ever: Between 1998-2000, the publicly held debt was reduced by $363\nbillionthe largest three-year pay-down in American history. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush,\nthe debt held by the public quadrupled. Under the Clinton-Gore budget, we are on track to pay off the\nentire publicly held debt on a net basis by 2009.\n-\nLower Federal Government Spending: After increasing under the previous two administrations, federal government\nspending as a share of the economy has been cut from 22.2 percent in 1992 to 18 percent in 2000the\nlowest level since 1966.\n-\nReduced Interest Payments on the Debt: In 1993, the net interest payments on the debt held by the public were\nprojected to grow to $348 billion in FY 2000. In 2000, interest payments on the debt were $125 billion lower\nthan projected.\n-\nAmericans Benefit from Reduced Debt: Because of fiscal discipline and deficit and debt reduction, it is\nestimated that a family with a home mortgage of $100,000 might expect to save roughly $2,000 per year in\nmortgage payments, like a large tax cut.\n-\nDouble Digit Growth in Private Investment in Equipment and Software: Lower debt will help maintain strong\neconomic growth and fuel private investments. With government no longer draining resources out of capital\nmarkets, private investment in equipment and software averaged 13.3 percent annual growth since 1993, compared\nto 4.7 percent during 1981 to 1992.\nTo Establish Fiscal Discipline, President Clinton:\n-\nEnacted the 1993 Deficit Reduction Plan without a Single Republican Vote. Prior to 1993, the debate over\nfiscal policy often revolved around a false choice between public investment and deficit reduction. The 1993\ndeficit reduction plan showed that deficit and debt reductions could be accomplished in a progressive way by\nslashing the deficit in half and making important investments in our future, including education, health care,\nand science and technology research. The plan included more than $500 billion in deficit reduction. It also\ncut taxes for 15 million of the hardest-pressed Americans by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit; created\nthe Direct Student Loan Program; created the first nine Empowerment Zones and first 95 Enterprise Communities;\nand passed tax cuts for small businesses and research and development.\n-\nNegotiated the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. In his 1997 State of the Union address, President\nClinton announced his plan to balance the budget for the first time in 27 years. Later that year, he signed\nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a major bipartisan agreement to eliminate the national budget deficit, create\nthe conditions for economic growth, and invest in the education and health of our people. It provided\nmiddle-class tax relief with a $500 per child tax credit and the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax\ncredits for college. It also created the Children's Health Insurance Program to serve up to 5 million\nchildren and made landmark investments in education initiatives including educational technology, charter\nschools, Head Start, and Pell Grants. Finally, it added 20 more Empowerment Zones and 20 more rural Enterprise\nCommunities, included the President's plan to revitalize the District of Columbia, and continued welfare\nreform though $3 billion in new resources to move welfare recipients to private-sector jobs.\n-\nDedicated the Surplus to Save Social Security and Reduce the National Debt. In his 1998 and 1999 State\nof the Union addresses, President Clinton called on the nation to save the surplus until the solvency of\nSocial Security is assured. He also repeatedly vetoed large Republican tax cut bills that would have\njeopardized our nation's fiscal discipline. The President's actions led to a bipartisan consensus on saving\nthe surplus and paying down the debt.\n-\nExtended Medicare Solvency from 1999 to 2025. When President Clinton took office, Medicare was\nexpected to become insolvent in 1999, then only six years away. The 1993 deficit reduction act dedicated\nsome of the taxes paid by Social Security beneficiaries to the Medicare Trust Fund and extended the life of\nMedicare by three years to 2002. Thanks to additional provisions to combat waste, fraud and abuse and\nbipartisan cooperation in the 1997 balanced budget agreement, Medicare is now expected to remain solvent until\n2025.\n|\nClinton-Gore Economic Policy Has Dramatically Improved the Economy\n\"My colleagues and I have been very appreciative of your [President Clinton's] support of the Fed over the\nyears, and your commitment to fiscal discipline has been instrumental in achieving what in a few weeks will be\nthe longest economic expansion in the nation's history.\"\nAlan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, January 4, 2000, with President Clinton at\nChairman Greenspan's re-nomination announcement\n\"The deficit has come down, and I give the Clinton Administration and President Clinton himself a lot of\ncredit for that. [He] did something about it, fast. And I think we are seeing some benefits.\"\nPaul Volcker, Federal Reserve Board Chairman (1979-1987), in Audacity, Fall 1994\nOne of the reasons Goldman Sachs cites for the \"best economy ever\" is that \"on the policy side, trade,\nfiscal, and monetary policies have been excellent, working in ways that have facilitated growth without\ninflation. The Clinton Administration has worked to liberalize trade and has used any revenue windfalls to\nreduce the federal budget deficit.\"\nGoldman Sachs, March 1998\n\"Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion over five years,\nsparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and systems that\nbrought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity.\"\nBusiness Week, May 19, 1997\n|\nOpening World Markets to American Goods and Providing Leadership on Globalization\nPresident Clinton's Record on Trade and Globalization: In 1992, 10 million Americans were\nunemployed, new job creation was slow, and wages were stagnant. Other nations' high trade barriers limited the\nability of American businesses and farmers to sell their goods abroad and hampered economic recovery. Our trade\npolicies failed to reflect our values by failing to take into account the responsibility to protect our\nenvironment, eliminate child labor and sweatshops, and protect the rights of workers around the world.\nBut today:\n-\n300 Trade Agreements: President Clinton has opened markets for U.S. exports abroad and created American jobs through nearly 300 free and fair trade agreements.\n-\nThe Most U.S. Exports Ever. Between 1992 and 2000, U.S. exports of goods and services grew by 74 percent, or nearly $500 billion, to top $1 trillion for the first time.\n-\n1.4 Million More Jobs due to Exports: Jobs supported by American exports grew by 1.4 million between 1994 and 1998, with jobs supported by exports paying about 13 percent to 16 percent above the U.S. national average. Jobs related to goods exports pay, on average, 13 to 16 percent higher than other jobs.\n-\nLowest Inflation since the 1960s: Inflation is at the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, in part because global competition has kept prices low. It has averaged 2.5 percent under this Administration, down from 4.6 percent during the previous administration.\nTo Create Trade Opportunities and Expand the Benefits of Globalization, President Clinton:\n-\nWon Ratification of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, creating the world's largest\nfree\ntrade zone of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. U.S. exports to Mexico grew 109 percent from 1993 to 1999, while exports to the rest of the world grew by 49 percent.\n-\nWon Approval of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. In 2000, Congress ratified permanent normal trade relations with China. The agreement will integrate China into the world economy through entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), open Chinese market to U.S. exports, slash Chinese tariffs, and protect American workers and companies against dumping.\n-\nSuccessfully Completed the Uruguay Round. The 1994 Uruguay Round transformed the world trading system, opening markets in a wide range of industries, enabling the U.S. to enforce agreements more effectively, and applying the rules for the first time to all WTO members (now 138 in total).\n-\nFought for the First-Ever African and the Caribbean Basin Trade Bills. The African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 will support increased trade and investment between the United States and Africa, strengthen African economies and democratic governments, and increase partnerships to counter terrorism, crime, environmental degradation and disease. The legislation will also create incentives for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin to continue reforming their economies.\n-\nPromoted Trade Opportunities for High Technology. The Clinton Administration completed series of trade agreements on technology, including the WTO's commitment to duty-free cyberspace, keeping the Internet free of trade barriers, in 1998; the global WTO agreements on Financial Services and Basic Telecommunications in 1997; the global WTO agreement on Information Technology in 1996; and a series of bilateral agreements on intellectual property, high-tech products, services and other sectors. These efforts are the building blocks of the New Economy.\n-\nSecured Historic Debt Relief. In March 1999, President Clinton presented a plan to a U.S.-Africa Summit in Washington that became the basis for the G-7 agreement in Cologne, Germany (known as the Cologne Debt Initiative). The plan would triple the amount of debt relief available for poor countries, reducing their debt by about 70 percent ($90 billion), in return for firm commitments to channel the benefits into improving the lives of all their people. In September 1999, the President announced that the U.S. would unilaterally exceed the terms of the G-7 initiative and entirely cancel the $5.7 billion in U.S. government debt owed by qualifying countries. In November 2000, President Clinton won $435 million from Congress for U.S. participation in the Cologne Initiative.\n-\nDramatically Expanded U.S. Efforts to Fight Child Labor and Expand Basic Education. In June 1999, the President traveled to the International Labor Organization (ILO) conference in Geneva, Switzerland, to urge adoption of an historic international convention banning the worst forms of child labor. He won $30 million for ILO enforcement of child labor laws and is fighting for a new initiative to promote basic education in areas of the world where child labor is widespread. In 2000, at U.S. urging, the G-8 countries endorsed the goal of universal basic education. President Clinton brought other issues to the forefront of the international economic agenda, including incorporating labor and environmental considerations in the work of major international economic institutions, increasing U.S. support for global efforts to fight HIV-AIDS and infectious diseases, and closing the digital divide.\n-\nDefused International Economic Crises. In 1995, after Congress refused to act, President Clinton made $20 billion in emergency loans to Mexico to stabilize the country's financial markets. Mexico repaid the loans in full, with interest, three years ahead of schedule. Following the Asian and Russian financial crises in 1997 and 1998, the Clinton-Gore Administration led a global effort to re-capitalize the International Monetary Fund to allow it to more effectively deal with these problems. President Clinton also insisted that the G-7 develop a set of measures to restore confidence in the world financial system.\n-\nPromoted U.S. Competitiveness. The Clinton-Gore Administration has made key investments in education and training for American workers and research and development. It has also maintained federal fiscal discipline, helping to reduce interest rates, encourage private-sector investment, and keep productivity high.\nRewarding Work and Empowering Communities\nPresident Clinton's Record on Rewarding Work: In 1992, unemployment reached 7.5 percent, the\nhighest level in eight years. Unemployment and poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanics were\nalarming: unemployment reached 14.2 percent for African Americans and 11.8 percent for Hispanics, and poverty\nrates for both groups were nearly 30 percent. But today:\n-\nHigher Incomes at All Levels: After years of stagnant income growth among average and lower-income families, all income brackets have experienced double-digit income growth since 1993. The bottom 20 percent saw the largest income growth at 16.3 percent.\n-\nLowest Poverty Rate in 20 Years: Since Congress passed President Clinton's Economic Plan in 1993, the poverty rate declined from 15.1 percent to 11.8 percent last year, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. There are now 7 million fewer people in poverty than there were in 1993. The child poverty rate has declined more than 25 percent, the poverty rate for single mothers is the lowest ever, the African American and elderly poverty rates dropped to their lowest level on record, and the Hispanic poverty rate dropped to its lowest level since 1979.\n-\nLowest Poverty Rate for Single Mothers on Record: Under President Clinton, the poverty rate for families with single mothers has fallen from 46.1 percent in 1993 to 35.7 percent in 1999, the lowest level on record. Between 1980 and 1992, an additional 2.1 million households headed by single women were pushed into poverty.\n-\nSmallest Welfare Rolls Since 1969: Under the Clinton-Gore Administration, the welfare rolls have dropped\ndramatically and are now the lowest since 1969. Between January 1993 and September of 1999, the number of welfare recipients dropped by 7.5 million (a 53 percent decline) to 6.6 million. In comparison, between 1981-1992, the number of welfare recipients increased by 2.5 million (a 22 percent increase) to 13.6 million people.\nTo Help All Americans Benefit from Prosperity, President Clinton:\n-\nEnded Welfare as We Knew It. In 1996, President Clinton signed legislation requiring welfare recipients to work, limiting the time they can stay on welfare, and providing child care and health care to help them begin work. It also enacted tough new child support enforcement measures proposed by the President. In 1997, President Clinton won the welfare-to-work tax credit to encourage employers to hire long-term welfare recipients and $3 billion in additional resources to help communities move long-term welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs.\n-\nRewarded Work by Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 1993, President Clinton succeeded in winning passage of an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, giving a tax cut to 15 million of the hardest-pressed American workers. In 1999, the EITC lifted 4.1 million people out of poverty, nearly double the number lifted out of poverty by the EITC in 1993.\n-\nCreated Empowerment Zones. The 1993 Clinton-Gore economic plan created nine Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities to spur local community planning and economic growth in distressed communities through tax incentives and federal investment. The President won expansions of the program in 1994, 1997, and again in 2000. To date, the 31 Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities have leveraged over $10 billion in new private sector investment, creating thousands of new jobs for local residents.\n-\nCreated Community Development Financial Institutions. In September 1994, the President signed legislation creating the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, a Clinton campaign proposal to support specialized financial institutions serving often-overlooked customers and communities. The Fund has certified over 400 CDFIs. It has provided over $427 million to match investments in CDFIs and to encourage traditional financial institutions to increase their lending, investment and services in under-served markets.\n-\nStrengthened the Community Reinvestment Act. In 1995, the Administration updated the Community Reinvestment Act regulations to focus on banks' actual service delivery, rather than on compliance efforts. From 1993 to 1998, lenders subject to the law increased mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income families by 80 percentmore than twice the rate they increased mortgage lending to other income groups.\n-\nEncouraged Investment in America's New Markets. In 1999, the President went on two historic \"New Markets\" trips to highlight the continuing need to bring investment to impoverished inner cities, rural communities and Native American tribal lands. In 2000, the President and Congress worked together to pass this bipartisan initiative to stimulate new private capital investments in economically distressed communities and build network of private investment institutions to funnel credit, equity and technical assistance to businesses in America's new markets.\n-\nRaised the Minimum Wage. In 1996, President Clinton and Vice President Gore fought for and won a 90-cent per hour increase in the minimum wage, helping 10 million workers.\n-\nHelped People with Disabilities Work. In 1999, President Clinton insisted that Congress pass the Work Incentives Improvement Act as a condition of the budget agreement. This bipartisan law allows people with disabilities to maintain their Medicare or Medicaid coverage when they work.\nModernizing for the New Economy through Technology and Consensus Deregulation\nTo Capitalize on the Information Technology Revolution, President Clinton and Vice President Gore Have:\n-\nModernized Financial Services Laws. In 1993, the laws that governed America's financial service sector were antiquated and anti-competitive. The Clinton-Gore Administration fought to modernize those laws to increase competition in traditional banking, insurance, and securities industries to give consumers and small businesses more choices and lower costs. In 1994, the Clinton-Gore Administration broke another decades-old logjam by allowing banks to branch across state lines in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. President Clinton fought for and won financial modernization legislation, signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999.\n-\nReformed Telecommunications. In 1996, President Clinton signed legislation to open up competition between local telephone companies, long distance providers and cable companies. The law also requires the use of new V-chip technology to give families greater control over which television programming comes into their homes.\n-\nCreated the E-Rate. With the leadership of Vice President Gore, the Telecommunications Act contained the E-Rate initiative, which provides low-cost Internet connections for schools, libraries, rural health clinics and hospitals. More than 80 percent of America's public schools have benefited from the E-rate, which has helped connect 30 million children and up to 47,000 schools and libraries to the Internet. The percentage of public schools connected to the Internet has increased from 35 percent in 1994 to 95 percent in 1999. The percentage of classrooms connected to the Internet has increased from 3 percent in 1994 to 63 percent in 1999.\n-\nIncreased Resources for Educational Technology by Over 3,000 Percent. President Clinton and Vice President Gore increased our investment in educational technology by over 3,000 percent, from $23 million in FY 1994 to $769 million in FY 2000, including training over 600,000 new teachers to use technology effectively in the classroom.\n-\nPaved the Way for Electronic Commerce. President Clinton fought to eliminate legal barriers to using electronic technology to form and sign contracts, collect and store documents, and send and receive notices and disclosures, while ensuring that consumers on-line have the same protections that they have in the paper world. He signed the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act on June 30, 2000.\n-\nCreating Market Opportunities for Technology Firms. The Clinton-Gore Administration adopted a market-led approach on e-commerce, making spectrum available for digital wireless, and reforming Cold War export controls.\n-\nWorked to Close the Digital Divide. Since 1992, the President and Vice President have tripled funding for Community Technology Centers, which provide access to computers and the Internet to low-income urban and rural neighborhoods. President Clinton also challenged the private sector to develop new business models for low-cost computers and Internet access to make universal access at home affordable for all Americans. The Technology Literacy Challenge Fund has provided $1 billion in federal resources to help schools work with businesses and community organizations to put modern computers, high-quality educational software, and affordable connections to the Internet in every classroom. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created a temporary tax deduction for donations of computers to elementary and secondary schools.\n-\nForged Trade Agreements on High Technology. The Clinton Administration completed series of trade agreements on technology, including the WTO's commitment to duty-free cyberspace, keeping the Internet free of trade barriers, in 1998; the global WTO agreements on Financial Services and Basic Telecommunications in 1997; the global WTO agreement on Information Technology in 1996; and a series of bilateral agreements on intellectual property, high-tech products, services and other sectors; all soon to be capped by the opening of a major networked economy initiative.\nInvesting in Educating and Training the American People\nPresident Clinton's Record on Investing in Americans:\n-\nMore Americans Are Enrolling in College: 66 percent of 1998 high school graduates enrolled in college or trade school the next fall, compared to 60 percent in 1990.\n-\nMore High School Students Are Preparing for College: The percentage of high school graduates who have taken four years of English and three years each of math, science, and social studies increased from 38 percent to 55 percent between 1990 and 1998. Research shows that high-quality academics in high school is key to college success.\n-\nMore Americans Are Earning College Degrees: Over 32 percent of 25- to 29-year-old high school graduates had earned at least a bachelor's degree in 1999, up from 27 percent in 1990. In particular, white and African American women have seen their college opportunities grow.\n-\nAmericans Are Becoming Lifelong Learners: 50 percent of adults participated in formal learning in the year prior to a 1999 survey, up from 38 percent in 1991.\nTo Provide Americans with More, Higher-Quality Education and Training, President Clinton:\n-\nCreated the College Tax Credits, the Largest Single Investment in Higher Education since the G.I. Bill. A $1,500 tax credit for the first two years of college, the Hope Scholarship will pay for nearly all of a typical community college's tuition and fees. The $1,000 Lifetime Learning Tax Credit reimburses families for 20 percent of their tuition and fees (up to $5,000 per family) for college, graduate study, or job training. Starting in 2003, the credit will reimburse families for 20 percent of their costs up to $10,000, for a maximum value of $2,000. This year, 10 million American families will save over $7 billion through the college tax credits.\n-\nDoubled Student Financial Aid. Students will receive over $50 billion in federal grants, loans, and work-study aid this year, up from $25 billion in 1993. President Clinton has consistently supported budget increases for Pell Grants; this year, over 3.8 million needy students receive a Pell Grant scholarship of up to $3,300, a $1,000 larger maximum grant than in 1993. The President won another increase for Pell Grants in the FY 2001 budget, bringing the maximum grant to $3,750. The President also won increases in work-study funding to help one million students pay for college.\n-\nCreated Direct Student Loans and Reduced Interest Rates. In the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, President Clinton won the Direct Student Loan program to improve customer service and compete with guaranteed lenders. It has saved taxpayers over $4 billion so far by eliminating lender subsidies. President Clinton also fought to reduce interest rates and fees in the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 and the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. As a result, students can expect to pay $1,300 less in interest and fees for the average $10,000 loan than they would have in 1992. The student loan default rate is now 6.9 percent, down from 22.4 percent eight years ago.\n-\nCreated New Paths to College through GEAR UP, AmeriCorps, and TRIO. President Clinton won the new GEAR UP initiative in the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 which is already helping 700,000 low-income middle school students prepare for college. Over 150,000 Americans have earned money for college while serving their communities through President Clinton's AmeriCorps program, a campaign promise enacted in 1993. To help disadvantaged youth prepare for and succeed in college, the TRIO programs have grown by $342 million over the past eight years.\n-\nStrengthened Elementary and Secondary Education. In 1994, President Clinton reformed federal education initiatives in the Improving America's Schools Act and the Goals 2000 Act. The President's new approach was grounded in the principles that all of America's students should meet high academic standards and the federal government should make new investments to help them meet those standards. The President has also fought to hire 100,000 teachers, promote educational technology, support charter schools, build K-16 partnerships, and focus on early reading through America Reads.\n-\nPassed the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. In 1992, President Clinton and Vice President Gore proposed to streamline and bring greater accountability to our nation's job training system. In 1998, they won legislation to meet the needs of both America's workers and businesses by encouraging local control of training and employment programs; helping customers locate assistance through one-stop centers; and empower adults to receive the training they need.\nReducing Tax Burdens for Average and Hard-Pressed Working Families.\nThe Clinton Record on Reducing Taxes for Working Families:\n-\nLowest Federal Income Tax Burden in 35 Years: Federal income taxes as a percentage of income for the typical American family have dropped to their lowest level in 35 years.\n-\nHigher Incomes even after Taxes and Inflation: Real after-tax incomes have grown for Americans at all income levels, much faster than they did prior to the Clinton-Gore Administration. Real after-tax incomes grew by an average of 2.6 percent per year for the lower-income half of taxpayers between 1993 and 1997, while growing by an average of 1.0 percent between 1981 and 1993.\nTo Cut Taxes for Working Americans, President Clinton:\n-\nExpanded the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 1993, President Clinton succeeded in expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, giving a tax cut to 15 million of the hardest-pressed American workers. In 1999, the EITC lifted 4.1 million people out of poverty, nearly double the number lifted out of poverty by the EITC in 1993.\n-\nCreated the $500 per Child Tax Credit. In 1997, President Clinton secured a $500 per child tax credit for 27 million families with children under 17, including 13 million children from families with incomes below $30,000.\n-\nWon the Hope Scholarship Tax Credit. President Clinton proposed tax credits for college tuition in 1996 and signed them into law in 1997 as part of the balanced budget agreement. The Hope Scholarship provides a tax credit of up to $1,500 for tuition and fees for the first two years of college, roughly equal to the cost of the average community college. It will save American families $4.9 billion this year.\n-\nWon the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. Also enacted in 1997, the Lifetime Learning tax credit provides a 20 percent tax credit on $5,000 of tuition and fees (to be raised to $10,000 in 2003) for college and graduate students and adults taking job training. It will reduce the cost of college and job training for American families by $2.4 billion this year.\n-\nEstablished Education IRAs. The 1997 balanced budget agreement also created Education IRAs. For each child under age 18, families may now deposit $500 per year into an Education IRA in the child's name. Earnings in the Education IRA accumulate tax-free and no taxes will be due upon withdrawal if the money is used to pay for college. The law also allowed taxpayers to withdraw funds from a traditional IRA without penalty to pay for higher education for themselves or their spouse, child, or even grandchild.\n-\nCreated Empowerment Zones. President Clinton created Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in 1993 and expanded them in 1994, 1997 and again in 2000 to spur economic growth in distressed communities through tax incentives and federal investment. To date, the 31 Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities have leveraged over $10 billion in new private sector investment, creating thousands of new jobs for local residents.\n-\nSimplified Pension Rules. In 1996, President Clinton signed the SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) plan into law, simplifying and expanding retirement plan coverage for small businesses.\n-\nSimplified Tax Laws and Protected Taxpayer Rights. President Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to simplify the tax laws and enhance taxpayers' rights. The law has saved families and businesses millions of hours be simplifying and reducing paperwork, such as allowing a tax exclusion for income from the sale of a home.\n-\nClosed Tax Loopholes. To ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share, the Clinton Administration addressed the use and proliferation of corporate tax shelters by proposing several remedies to curb the growth of such shelters by increasing disclosure of sheltering activities, increasing and strengthening the substantial understatement penalty, codifying the judicially-created economic substance doctrine, and providing consequences to all parties involved in an abusive sheltering transaction.\n|\nPRESIDENT CLINTON'S ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE\nTrade Expands Opportunity for American Workers\n\"Harley-Davidson is growing rapidly, and sales to other countries is one reason why. President Clinton's efforts to open foreign markets have made a difference and helped create jobs at Harley-Davidson.\"\nBobby Ramsey began working at the Harley-Davidson York plant in 1972 and is now responsible for inspecting all incoming motorcycle parts prior to the assembly process. Since 1995, Mr. Ramsey has also been his union's Chief Shop Steward, which entails handling all second step grievances of workers and helping represent his co-workers to management. U.S. exports of motorcycles and parts have grown by 15 percent a year from 1987 to 1998, reaching one-third of industry sales. Harley-Davidson will export 22 percent of the motorcycles produced in Mr. Ramsey's plant. By 2003, Harley-Davidson expects to double production from 1996 levels largely because of exports, creating new jobs for American workers.\n\"Kodak and its employees have experienced significant gains because of NAFTA. The NAFTA has enabled Kodak to realize considerable tariff savings and to make production decisions based on rational economic grounds rather than on tariff considerations. For example, the agreement has enabled Kodak to transfer a high-cost sensitizing operation for color negative film from Mexico to Rochester, New York. In all, NAFTA has been a win-win-win for Kodak's operations in Canada, Mexico and the United States.\"\nDan Carp, President and CEO of the Eastman Kodak company, credits NAFTA with Kodak's rapid growth in export sales. Eastman Kodak manufactures high technology imaging products for sale in 160 countries. Under NAFTA, Mexican duties on film and photo paper have been reduced from 15 to 30 percent to 6 to 9 percent, and they will be eliminated by 2004. Kodak's exports to Mexico have more than doubled since 1993, creating greater stability and more job opportunities for Kodak's 54,000 employees.\nMaking the Dream of Homeownership a Reality\n\"I feel true independence in owning my own home. To those who think it's impossible: It is possible. Don't let anyone talk you out of it.\"\nLucy Vocu, a teacher and single mother. Lucy Vocu has lived on the Pine Ridge reservation all her life.

She currently works for the Shannon County school system at Wolf Creek School. Her children, Grace, 15, and Jacob, 7, spend a lot of time using their computer. Jacob recently tracked tornadoes on the Internet. Lucy is a first-time homeowner. She moved from a two-bedroom rental house into this new three-bedroom home, which offers more privacy. Lucy is excited about being a new homeowner and, if her budget allows, she hopes to add to her new home a swing set for Jacob and a basketball net for Grace.\n|\n|\n\"The social workers at Marion House, which has received funding from HUD's homeless grants, helped me get back on my feet. They counseled me on how to find a job and helped me learn the skills I would need to stay employed. Today I am newly married, and I have been working the last four years as a secretary for a social service agency. And I am delighted to say . . . I am a homeowner. Because of your leadership President Clinton, and because of your commitment to providing funding for homeless programs across the country, there will be hope and optimism in place of despair.\"\nChrista Spangler, of Baltimore, MD, December 23, 1998. Christa Spangler was a formerly homeless woman who hit rock bottom in 1994 when she was forced to live in her car.

She found her way to Marion House, a Catholic transitional housing program for homeless women and children. Christa is now married, working as a receptionist and living in her own home. Federal resources pay 25 percent of the Marion House budget.\nEmpowerment Zones Are a Potent Weapon Against Poverty\n\"I am living proof that the Empowerment Zone works! If it wasn't for the Empowerment Zone, I would have never have had the chance to buy this building or to expand my business. We are fighting the war against poverty throughout our neighborhoods and cities, but we have a very potent weapon the Empowerment Zones. And we will use that weapon to win this war because, after all, our future and our children's future depends on it. We must never give up hope.\"\nNancy Santana, 37, is a single mother of three who lives in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She used resources and a loan she obtained through her local Empowerment Zone to move from welfare to start her own business, Nancy Santana's Cleaning and Maintenance Services. Four years later, her business employs over 25 people, many of whom she recruited off of welfare.\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions Expand Economic Opportunity\n\"President Clinton's efforts have been very helpful to me. I had trouble getting funding from other sources. The Enterprise Corporation of the Delta has worked with me and people in my community, helping us improve our position in life. Now, I can get into this business, where otherwise I could not have.\"\nEphron Lewis co-founded Lewis & Sons Rice Processing the only African-American-owned rice processing company in the country with his father.

With this, China has contributed close to three-quarters of the global reduction in the number of people living in extreme poverty. At China’s current national poverty line, the number of poor fell by 770 million over the same period.\nTo take stock of this achievement, a joint study – “Four Decades of Poverty Reduction in China: Drivers, Insights for the World, and the Way Ahead” – was undertaken by China’s Ministry of Finance, the Development Research Center (DRC) of the State Council, and the World Bank, with the China Center for International Knowledge on Development (CIKD) acting as the implementing agency. The report looks at the key drivers of China’s poverty alleviation achievements over the past 40 years, considers the insights of China’s experience for other developing countries and puts forward suggestions for China’s own future policies.\n“China’s battle against poverty has benefited the largest number of people in human history,” said Minister Ma Jiantang, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the DRC. “To sustain poverty reduction gains, China will focus more on achieving endogenous development in areas that have been lifted out of poverty and introduce vigorous measures to support rural revitalization. Our goal is to achieve common prosperity and high-quality development including through the rural revitalization strategy with a focus in five key areas: industry development, human capital, culture, ecological environment and local governance.”\n“China achieved its goal of poverty reduction in the new era as scheduled at the end of 2020”, said Yu Weiping, Vice Minister of Finance. “We have accomplished the arduous task of eliminating extreme poverty, and made significant contributions to global poverty reduction. Going forward, China will continue to sustain and expand the gains in poverty alleviation and comprehensively realize rural revitalization. The Ministry of Finance will ensure that sound fiscal policy measures will be made and implemented to support the transition. We stand ready to continue strengthening cooperation with the World Bank in relevant areas.”\n“China’s poverty reduction story is a story of persistent growth through economic transformation,” said Manuela V. Ferro, World Bank Vice President for East Asia and Pacific. “As China’s economy adjusts to a new low carbon growth model, its social policies will need to be adapted to support greater labor mobility, upgrade skill levels in line with shifts in labor demand, and offer improved social protection to ensure a just transition.”\nChina’s approach to poverty reduction has been based on two pillars, according to the report. The first was broad-based economic transformation to open new economic opportunities and raise average incomes. The second was the recognition that targeted support was needed to alleviate persistent poverty; support was initially provided to areas disadvantaged by geography and the lack of opportunities and later to individual households. The report points to a number of lessons for other countries from China’s experience, including the importance of a focus on education, an outward orientation, sustained public investments in infrastructure, and structural policies supportive of competition.\nThe report also highlights how the success of China’s economic development and the associated reduction of poverty benefited from effective governance, which helped coordinate multiple government agencies and elicit cooperation from non-government stakeholders. To illustrate the role of broad-based economic transformation in poverty alleviation, separate sections of the report analyze growing agricultural productivity, incremental industrialization, managed urbanization and rural-to-urban migration, and the role of infrastructure. The evolution of China’s approach to poverty alleviation, from place-based to country-wide social protection policies, and the targeted poverty alleviation strategy since 2012 are also reviewed.\nThe report considers the likely future structural shifts in China’s growth model, including rebalancing towards consumption and high value services and embarking on the transition towards carbon neutrality, and their implications for China’s future policy agenda. It highlights the need to close remaining gaps in quality education between rural and urban areas and to provide better social protection to migrant workers, and the scope for improved integration of the various existing social security policies.\nOver the past two years, the joint research team conducted field studies in the regions of Ningxia and Zhejiang, held a series of workshops with domestic and international experts, and worked closely with academic institutions on data analysis. Several working papers have been published containing details of the case studies and data analysis. The report presents a synthesis of this work.\nThe study was released on March 31 at a joint event in Beijing attended by Secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the DRC Ma Jiantang, Vice Minister of Finance Yu Weiping, and World Bank Vice President for East Asia and Pacific Manuela V. Ferro.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        |\nPRESIDENT WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTONSTATE OF THE UNION ADDRESSU.S. CAPITOLJANUARY 23, 1996Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 104th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our land: Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform around the world, and especially those helping peace take root in Bosnia and to their families, I thank you. America is very, very proud of you. My duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union -- not the state of our government, but of our American community; and to set forth our responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, to form a more perfect union. The state of the Union is strong. Our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years. We have created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a million of them in basic industries, like construction and automobiles. America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 1970s. And for three years in a row, we have had a record number of new businesses started in our country. Our leadership in the world is also strong, bringing hope for new peace. And perhaps most important, we are gaining ground in restoring our fundamental values. The crime rate, the welfare and food stamp rolls, the poverty rate and the teen pregnancy rate are all down. And as they go down, prospects for America's future go up. We live in an age of possibility. A hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory. Now we move to an age of technology, information, and global competition. These changes have opened vast new opportunities for our people, but they have also presented them with stiff challenges. While more Americans are living better, too many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up, and they are rightly concerned about the security of their families. We must answer here three fundamental questions: First, how do we make the American Dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans who are willing to work for it? Second, how do we preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future? And, third, how do we meet these challenges together, as one America? We know big government does not have all the answers. We know there's not a program for every problem. We have worked to give the American people a smaller, less bureaucratic government in Washington. And we have to give the American people one that lives within its means. The era of big government is over. But we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves. Instead, we must go forward as one America, one nation working together to meet the challenges we face together. Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have both. I believe our new, smaller government must work in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens through state and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable and civic associations. Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of their own lives -- with stronger families, more educational opportunity, economic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world. To improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of ourselves, we must expect more of each other, and we must face our challenges together. Here, in this place, our responsibility begins with balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all Americans. There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end. I compliment the Republican leadership and the membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this task of balancing the budget. And I thank the Democrats for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993, which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in three years. Since 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit reduction. Lower interest rates have made it easier for businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs. Lower interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages, car payments and credit card rates to ordinary citizens. Now, it is time to finish the job and balance the budget. Though differences remain among us which are significant, the combined total of the proposed savings that are common to both plans is more than enough, using the numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in seven years and to provide a modest tax cut. These cuts are real. They will require sacrifice from everyone. But these cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents, our children, and our future, by endangering Medicare, or Medicaid, or education, or the environment, or by raising taxes on working families. I have said before, and let me say again, many good ideas have come out of our negotiations. I have learned a lot about the way both Republicans and Democrats view the debate before us. I have learned a lot about the good ideas that we could all embrace. We ought to resolve our remaining differences. I am willing to work to resolve them. I am ready to meet tomorrow. But I ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that both plans have in common and give the American people their balanced budget, a tax cut, lower interest rates, and a brighter future. We should do that now, and make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy. Now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and tomorrow, beyond the burdens of yesterday. The challenges are significant. But America was built on challenges, not promises. And when we work together to meet them, we never fail. That is the key to a more perfect Union. Our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts. Tonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we all face as a people. Our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen America's families. Family is the foundation of American life. If we have stronger families, we will have a stronger America. Before I go on, I would like to take just a moment to thank my own family, and to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and children -- a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great First Lady. Thank you, Hillary. All strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our children. I have heard Mrs. Gore say that it's hard to be a parent today, but it's even harder to be a child. So all of us, not just as parents, but all of us in our other roles -- our media, our schools, our teachers, our communities, our churches and synagogues, our businesses, our governments -- all of us have a responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most of their lives and their God-given capacities. To the media, I say you should create movies and CDs and television shows you'd want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy. I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children. When parents control what their young children see, that is not censorship; that is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing. And I urge them to do it. The V-chip requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now pending in this Congress. It has bipartisan support, and I urge you to pass it now. To make the V-chip work, I challenge the broadcast industry to do what movies have done -- to identify your programming in ways that help parents to protect their children. And I invite the leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to come to the White House next month to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television. I am ready to work with you. I say to those who make and market cigarettes: every year a million children take up smoking, even though it is against the law. Three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened as a result. Our administration has taken steps to stop the massive marketing campaigns that appeal to our children. We are simply saying: Market your products to adults, if you wish, but draw the line on children. I say to those who are on welfare, and especially to those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time: For too long our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work, instead of supporting them. The Congress and I are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform. We agree on time limits, tough work requirements, and the toughest possible child support enforcement. But I believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is happening to their children. I challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing by our children. I will sign it immediately. Let us be candid about this difficult problem. Passing a law, even the best possible law, is only a first step. The next step is to make it work. I challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for independence. I challenge American businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work force. I applaud the work of religious groups and others who care for the poor. More than anyone else in our society, they know the true difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a position to help. Every one of us should join them. That is the only way we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American people. To strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen pregnancy rate going down. I am gratified, as I'm sure all Americans are, that it has dropped for two years in a row. But we all know it is still far too high. Tonight I am pleased to announce that a group of prominent Americans is responding to that challenge by forming an organization that will support grass-roots community efforts all across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy. And I challenge all of us and every American to join their efforts. I call on American men and women in families to give greater respect to one another. We must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our country. And I challenge America's families to work harder to stay together. For families who stay together not only do better economically, their children do better as well. In particular, I challenge the fathers of this country to love and care for their children. If your family has separated, you must pay your child support. We're doing more than ever to make sure you do, and we're going to do more, but let's all admit something about that, too: A check will not substitute for a parent's love and guidance. And only you -- only you can make the decision to help raise your children. No matter who you are, how low or high your station in life, it is the most basic human duty of every American to do that job to the best of his or her ability. Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational opportunities we will all need for this new century. In our schools, every classroom in America must be connected to the information superhighway, with computers and good software, and well-trained teachers. We are working with the telecommunications industry, educators and parents to connect 20 percent of California's classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and every library in the entire United States by the year 2000. I ask Congress to support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure this national partnership succeeds. Every diploma ought to mean something. I challenge every community, every school and every state to adopt national standards of excellence; to measure whether schools are meeting those standards; to cut bureaucratic red tape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility for grass-roots reform; and to hold them accountable for results. That's what our Goals 2000 initiative is all about. I challenge every state to give all parents the right to choose which public school their children will attend; and to let teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job. I challenge all our schools to teach character education, to teach good values and good citizenship. And if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms. I challenge our parents to become their children's first teachers. Turn off the TV. See that the homework is done. And visit your children's classroom. No program, no teacher, no one else can do that for you. My fellow Americans, higher education is more important today than ever before. We've created a new student loan program that's made it easier to borrow and repay those loans, and we have dramatically cut the student loan default rate. That's something we should all be proud of, because it was unconscionably high just a few years ago. Through AmeriCorps, our national service program, this year 25,000 young people will earn college money by serving their local communities to improve the lives of their friends and neighbors. These initiatives are right for America and we should keep them going. And we should also work hard to open the doors of college even wider. I challenge Congress to expand work-study and help one million young Americans work their way through college by the year 2000; to provide a $1000 merit scholarship for the top five percent of graduates in every high school in the United States; to expand Pell Grant scholarships for deserving and needy students; and to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition tax deductible. It's a good idea for America. Our third challenge is to help every American who is willing to work for it, achieve economic security in this new age. People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new economy. They need education and training for a lifetime. They need more support for families raising children. They need retirement security. They need access to health care. More and more Americans are finding that the education of their childhood simply doesn't last a lifetime. So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, antiquated job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition or other training. This is a G.I. Bill for America's workers we should all be able to agree on. More and more Americans are working hard without a raise. Congress sets the minimum wage. Within a year, the minimum wage will fall to a 40-year low in purchasing power. Four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer a living wage, but millions of Americans and their children are trying to live on it. I challenge you to raise their minimum wage. In 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard-pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work full-time would have to raise their children in poverty, and to encourage people to move from welfare to work. This expanded earned income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to a family of four living on $20,000. The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these people. We should not do that. I also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to do a good job raising their children and at work. I agree that we need a tax credit for working families with children. That's one of the things most of us in this Chamber, I hope, can agree on. I know it is strongly supported by the Republican majority. And it should be part of any final budget agreement. I want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide pensions for your employees. And I challenge Congress to pass a proposal recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business that would make it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish their own pension plans. That is something we should all agree on. We should also protect existing pension plans. Two years ago, with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle, we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more. Congress should not now let companies endanger those workers's pension funds. I know the proposal to liberalize the ability of employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would raise money for the treasury. But I believe it is false economy. I vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so again. Finally, if our working families are going to succeed in the new economy, they must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick. Over the past two years, over one million Americans in working families have lost their health insurance. We have to do more to make health care available to every American. And Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require insurance companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs, and stop denying coverage for preexisting conditions. Let's all do that. And even as we enact savings in these programs, we must have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of Medicare and Medicaid -- not just to the poor, but to people in working families, including children, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, and senior citizens in nursing homes. In the past three years, we've saved $15 billion just by fighting health care fraud and abuse. We have all agreed to save much more. We have all agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund. But we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who need Medicare and Medicaid. America cannot become stronger if they become weaker. The G.I. Bill for workers, tax relief for education and child rearing, pension availability and protection, access to health care, preservation of Medicare and Medicaid -- these things, along with the Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993 -- these things will help responsible, hard-working American families to make the most of their own lives. But employers and employees must do their part, as well, as they are doing in so many of our finest companies -- working together, putting the long-term prosperity ahead of the short-term gain. As workers increase their hours and their productivity, employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad ones. When companies and workers work as a team they do better, and so does America. Our fourth great challenge is to take our streets back from crime and gangs and drugs. At last we have begun to find a way to reduce crime, forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch criminals and prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing, is clearly working. Violent crime is coming down all across America. In New York City murders are down 25 percent; in St. Louis, 18 percent; in Seattle, 32 percent. But we still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our people are free from fear. The Crime Bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing. It provides funds for 100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We're already a third of the way there. And I challenge the Congress to finish the job. Let us stick with a strategy that's working and keep the crime rate coming down. Community policing also requires bonds of trust between citizens and police. I ask all Americans to respect and support our law enforcement officers. And to our police, I say, our children need you as role models and heroes. Don't let them down. The Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records from buying guns. The assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. I challenge the Congress to keep those laws on the books. Our next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the mob. I'm directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles in violent crime, and to seek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like adults. And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations: Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants. From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and peddle drugs should be one strike and you're out. I challenge every state to match federal policy to assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence. More police and punishment are important, but they're not enough. We have got to keep more of our young people out of trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, but developed in communities. I challenge all of our communities, all of our adults, to give our children futures to say yes to. And I challenge Congress not to abandon the Crime Bill's support of these grass-roots prevention efforts. Finally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem. The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their children openly and firmly. It embraces our churches and synagogues, our youth groups and our schools. I challenge Congress not to cut our support for drug-free schools. People like the D.A.R.E. officers are making a real impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time comes. Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into America. For the last two years, one man in particular has been on the front lines of that effort. Tonight I am nominating him -- a hero of the Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of the United States Military Southern Command -- General Barry McCaffrey, as America's new Drug Czar. General McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars fighting for this country. Tonight I ask that he lead our nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad. To succeed, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before. He needs all of us. Every one of us has a role to play on this team. Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one more time. Our fifth challenge: to leave our environment safe and clean for the next generation. Because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have cleaner water and air, lead levels in children's blood has been cut by 70 percent, toxic emissions from factories cut in half. Lake Erie was dead, and now it's a thriving resource. But 10 million children under 12 still live within four miles of a toxic waste dump. A third of us breathe air that endangers our health. And in too many communities, the water is not safe to drink. We still have much to do. Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent. That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more smog in our air, more pesticides in our food. Lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children. Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook. I challenge Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them. This issue has not been a partisan issue. The most significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under a Democratic Congress and President Richard Nixon. We can work together. We have to believe some basic things. Do you believe we can expand the economy without hurting the environment? I do. Do you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment up? I know we can. That should be our commitment. We must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment, and we have to make it easier for them to do it. To businesses this administration is saying: If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards, do it -- as long as you do it right. To communities we say: We must strengthen community right-to-know laws requiring polluters to disclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work with business to cut pollution. People do have a right to know that their air and their water are safe. Our sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world. Because of American leadership, more people than ever before live free and at peace. And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security. We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II. I would like to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all others in this Chamber who fought in World War II, and to all others on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our conflicts since: I salute your service, and so do the American people. All over the world, even after the Cold War, people still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of peace and freedom. But as the Cold War fades into memory, voices of isolation say America should retreat from its responsibilities. I say they are wrong. The threats we face today as Americans respect no nation's borders. Think of them: terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic and religious hatred, aggression by rogue states, environmental degradation. If we fail to address these threats today, we will suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows. Of course, we can't be everywhere. Of course, we can't do everything. But where our interests and our values are at stake, and where we can make a difference, America must lead. We must not be isolationist. We must not be the world's policeman. But we can and should be the world's very best peacemaker. By keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy where we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for people here and around the world. For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not a single Russian missile pointed at America's children. North Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program. In Haiti, the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided. Through tougher trade deals for America -- over 80 of them -- we have opened markets abroad, and now exports are at an all-time high, growing faster than imports and creating good American jobs. We stood with those taking risks for peace: In Northern Ireland, where Catholic and Protestant children now tell their parents, violence must never return. In the Middle East, where Arabs and Jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share knowledge and resources, and even dreams. And we stood up for peace in Bosnia. Remember the skeletal prisoners, the mass graves, the campaign to rape and torture, the endless lines of refugees, the threat of a spreading war. All these threats, all these horrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace. Now, our troops and a strong NATO, together with our new partners from Central Europe and elsewhere, are helping that peace to take hold. As all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan congressional group, and I was so proud not only of what our troops were doing, but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing. They knew what America's mission in this world is, and they were proud to be carrying it out. Through these efforts, we have enhanced the security of the American people. But make no mistake about it:important challenges remain. The START II Treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by another 25 percent. I urge the Senate to ratify it -- now. We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty -- this year. As we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we can outlaw poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention -- this year. We can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad if Congress passes the anti-terrorism legislation I proposed after the Oklahoma City bombing -- now. We can help more people move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if Congress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace. My fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just discussed are for all of us. Our seventh challenge is really America's challenge to those of us in this hallowed hall tonight: to reinvent our government and make our democracy work for them. Last year this Congress applied to itself the laws it applies to everyone else. This Congress banned gifts and meals from lobbyists. This Congress forced lobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill. This Congress did that, and I applaud you for it. Now I challenge Congress to go further -- to curb special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign reform bill in a generation. You, Republicans and Democrats alike, can show the American people that we can limit spending and open the airwaves to all candidates. I also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you promised the American people. Our administration is working hard to give the American people a government that works better and costs less. Thanks to the work of Vice President Gore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of unnecessary rules and regulations, shifting more decision-making out of Washington, back to states and local communities. As we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller government, we must work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own lives. We are helping America's communities, not with more bureaucracy, but with more opportunities. Through our successful Empowerment Zones and Community Development Banks, we are helping people to find jobs, to start businesses. And with tax incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property, we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately need them. But there are some areas that the federal government should not leave and should address and address strongly. One of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration. After years of neglect, this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders. We are increasing border controls by 50 percent. We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants. And tonight, I announce I will sign an executive order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants. Let me be very clear about this: We are still a nation of immigrants; we should be proud of it. We should honor every legal immigrant here, working hard to become a new citizen. But we are also a nation of laws. I want to say a special word now to those who work for our federal government. Today our federal government is 200,000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President. Our federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, and it's getting smaller every day. Most of our fellow Americans probably don't know that. And there is a good reason: The remaining federal work force is composed of Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever before, to make sure the quality of our services does not decline. I'd like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He is a 49 year-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him. He reentered that building four times. He saved the lives of three women. He's here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism. But Richard Dean's story doesn't end there. This last November, he was forced out of his office when the government shut down. And the second time the government shut down he continued helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay. On behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I challenge all of you in this Chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again. On behalf of all Americans, especially those who need their Social Security payments at the beginning of March, I also challenge the Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States -- to honor the obligations of this great nation as we have for 220 years; to rise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people America keeps its word. I know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress, and even more from America. But I am confident: When Americans work together in their homes, their schools, their churches, their synagogues, their civic groups, their workplace, they can meet any challenge. I say again, the era of big government is over. But we can't go back to the era of fending for yourself. We have to go forward to the era of working together as a community, as a team, as one America, with all of us reaching across these lines that divide us -- the division, the discrimination, the rancor -- we have to reach across it to find common ground. We have got to work together if we want America to work. I want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that. Lucius Wright is a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public school system. A Vietnam veteran, he has created groups to help inner-city children turn away from gangs and build futures they can believe in. Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in Oklahoma City. Like Richard Dean, she helped to pull her fellow citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy. She reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and community. Lucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special Americans. And I have the honor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several thousand Americans who will be chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its long journey from Los Angeles to the centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this summer -- not because they are star athletes, but because they are star citizens, community heroes meeting America's challenges. They are our real champions. Now, each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own lives. None of us can finish the race alone. We can only achieve our destiny together -- one hand, one generation, one American connecting to another. There have always been things we could do together -- dreams we could make real -- which we could never have done on our own. We Americans have forged our identity, our very union, from every point of view and every point on the planet, every different opinion. But we must be bound together by a faith more powerful than any doctrine that divides us -- by our belief in progress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search for common ground. America has always sought and always risen to every challenge. Who would say that, having come so far together, we will not go forward from here? Who would say that this age of possibility is not for all Americans? Our country is and always has been a great and good nation. But the best is yet to come, if we all do our part. Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\nPresident and First Lady | Vice President and Mrs. Gore |\n|\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

There have been longstanding racial and ethnic disparities in health coverage that contribute to disparities in health. This brief examines trends in health coverage by race and ethnicity from 2010 through 2023 and discusses the implications for health disparities. All noted differences between groups and years described in the text are statistically significant at the p<0.05 level. It is based on KFF analysis of American Community Survey (ACS) data for people under age 65. Key takeaways include:\nThere were gains in coverage across most racial and ethnic groups between 2019 and 2023 after several years of rising uninsured rates during the first Trump administration. The coverage gains between 2019 and 2023 were largely driven by increases in Medicaid coverage, reflecting policies to stabilize and expand access to affordable coverage that were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. These policies included enhanced subsidies to purchase Marketplace coverage and a requirement that states keep Medicaid enrollees continuously enrolled during the public health emergency (PHE), which led to record high Medicaid enrollment. While Medicaid enrollment fell as the pandemic era protections were unwound, it has remained higher than in 2019. These coverage gains helped narrow differences in uninsured rates for Hispanic, Black, and American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) people compared with White people, but the gains may be at risk due to potential Medicaid cuts and the expiration of the enhanced Marketplace subsidies.\nDespite these coverage gains, disparities in coverage persisted as of 2023. AIAN and Hispanic people under age 65 had the highest uninsured rates at 18.7% and 17.9%, respectively. Uninsured rates for Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) (12.8%) and Black people (9.7%) under age 65 also were higher than the rate for their White counterparts (6.5%). Coverage disparities have persisted over time, and in some cases widened despite recent gains and earlier large gains in coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). For example, between 2010 and 2023, the uninsured rate for AIAN people grew from 2.4 to 2.9 times higher than the uninsured rate for White people, the Hispanic uninsured rate grew from 2.5 to 2.7 times higher than the rate for White people, and Black people remained 1.5 times more likely to be uninsured than White people.\nUninsured rates in states that have not expanded Medicaid are higher than rates in expansion states across most racial and ethnic groups as of 2023. Further, the differences in coverage rates between Hispanic, Black and NHPI people compared with White people are larger in non-expansion states compared with expansion states. However, the relative risk of being uninsured for Black and Hispanic people compared to White people is similar in expansion and non-expansion states.\nGoing forward, racial and ethnic disparities in coverage could widen due to potential Medicaid cuts, expiration of the enhanced subsidies for Marketplace coverage, and immigration policy changes. The incoming Trump administration and Republican controlled Congress are signaling plans to make significant changes to Medicaid and the ACA. House Republicans appear to be considering large cuts to Medicaid, which could help offset the cost of extending expiring tax cuts but would shift a substantial amount of Medicaid spending from the federal government to states, and likely lead states to make reductions in eligibility and/or benefits. Further, if Congress does not take action to extend the enhanced ACA Marketplace subsidies, which are set to expire in 2025, premiums will rise, likely leading to an increase in the number of uninsured people. Additionally, the Trump administration’s changes to immigration policy, including increased enforcement, the rescission of protections from enforcement activity in sensitive locations including health care facilities, and potential changes to public charge policy, will likely lead to reduced enrollment in health coverage of lawfully present immigrants and citizen children in immigrant families. Medicaid and Marketplace coverage losses would likely lead to widening racial disparities in coverage given that disproportionately large shares of Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI people are covered through these sources, which, in turn, would likely contribute to widening disparities in health.\nTrends in Uninsured Rates by Race and Ethnicity, 2010-2023\nPrior to the enactment of the ACA in 2010, Hispanic, Black, Asian, AIAN, and NHPI people under age 65 were more likely to be uninsured compared to their White counterparts, with Hispanic and AIAN people at the highest risk of lacking coverage (Figure 1). Their higher uninsured rates reflected more limited access to affordable health coverage options. Although the majority of individuals have at least one full-time worker in the family across racial and ethnic groups, there are ongoing racial disparities in employment and income that result in some groups having more limited access to coverage offered by an employer or having greater difficulty affording private coverage when it is available. While Medicaid helped fill some of these gaps in private coverage, prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility for parents in most states was limited to those with very low incomes (often below 50% of the poverty level), and adults without dependent children—regardless of how poor—were ineligible under federal rules.\nBetween 2010 and 2016, there were large gains in coverage across racial and ethnic groups under the ACA, but racial and ethnic disparities in coverage persisted. The ACA created new coverage options for low- and moderate-income individuals. These included provisions to extend dependent coverage in the private market up to age 26 and prevent insurers from denying people coverage or charging them more due to health status that went into place. Further, beginning in 2014, the ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes at or below 138% of poverty in states that adopted the expansion and made tax credits available to people with incomes up to 400% of poverty to purchase coverage through a health insurance Marketplace. Following the ACA’s enactment in 2010 through 2016, coverage increased across all racial and ethnic groups, with the largest increases occurring after implementation of the Medicaid and Marketplace coverage expansions in 2014. Hispanic people under age 65 had the largest percentage point increase in coverage, and their uninsured rate falling from 32.6% to 19.1%. Black, Asian, and AIAN people also had larger percentage point increases in coverage compared to White people over that period. Despite these larger gains, Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI people under age 65 remained more likely than their White counterparts to be uninsured as of 2016.\nBeginning in 2017, coverage gains began reversing, and the number of uninsured increased for three consecutive years. The uninsured rate for the total population under age 65 increased from 10.0% in 2016 to 10.9% in 2019. Among this age group, Hispanic people had the largest statistically significant increase in their uninsured rate over this period (from 19.1% to 20.0%). There were also small but statistically significant increases in the uninsured rates among White and Black people under age 65, which rose from 7.1% to 7.8% and 10.7% to 11.4%, respectively, between 2016 and 2019. Rates for AIAN, NHPI, and Asian people under age 65 did not have a significant change. These coverage losses likely reflected policy changes made by the first Trump administration after taking office in 2017. These changes included decreased funds for outreach and enrollment assistance, guidance encouraging states to seek waivers to add new eligibility requirements for Medicaid coverage as well as to increase the frequency of eligibility verifications, and changes to public charge immigration policy that made some immigrant families more reluctant to participate in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (which were later reversed by the Biden administration).\nAfter increasing for several years prior to the pandemic, uninsured rates declined between 2019 and 2023. The number of people under age 65 with insurance increased by 3.6 million between 2019 and 2023 as the uninsured rate dropped from 10.9% to 9.6%. (Because of disruptions in data collection during the first year of the pandemic, the Census Bureau did not release 1-year ACS estimates in 2020.) AIAN people had the largest percentage point increase in coverage, with their uninsured rate falling from 21.7% in 2019 to 18.7% in 2023. There were also smaller but statistically significant declines in uninsured rates among Hispanic (from 20.0% to 17.9%), Black (from 11.4% to 9.7%), Asian (from 7.2% to 5.8%), and White people (from 7.8% to 6.5%) during this period. These coverage gains were primarily driven by increases in Medicaid coverage, which offset declines in employer-sponsored coverage over the period. NHPI people did not have statistically significant changes in coverage over this period.\nThe coverage gains observed between 2019 and 2023 largely reflect policies adopted during the pandemic to stabilize coverage in Medicaid and enhance subsidies to purchase Marketplace coverage. Coverage gains reflected provisions in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), enacted at the start of the pandemic that prohibited states from disenrolling people from Medicaid during the Public Health Emergency in exchange for enhanced federal funding. While Medicaid enrollment fell as the pandemic era protections were unwound, it has remained higher than in 2019. In addition, gains reflected enhanced ACA Marketplace subsidies made available by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and renewed in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), boosted outreach and enrollment efforts, and low Marketplace attrition. Further, in 2019, the Biden administration reversed changes the Trump administration previously made to public charge immigration policies that had increased reluctance among some immigrant families to enroll in public programs, including health coverage.\nCoverage disparities have persisted, and in some cases widened, over time even with recent gains and the large earlier gains in coverage under the ACA. For example, in 2010, the uninsured rate for AIAN people was 2.4 times higher than the uninsured rate for White people; however, in 2023, the uninsured rate for AIAN people had increased to 2.9 times higher than the rate for White people. Similarly, the Hispanic uninsured rate grew from 2.5 to 2.8 times higher than the rate for White people from 2010 to 2023, while Black people remained 1.5 times more likely to be uninsured than White people.\nCoverage by Race and Ethnicity as of 2023\nWhile there were minimal changes in overall uninsured rates between 2022 and 2023, Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI people under the age of 65 years old remained more likely than their White counterparts to be uninsured (Figure 2). AIAN and Hispanic people had the highest uninsured rates at 18.7% and 17.9%, respectively, as of 2023. Uninsured rates for NHPI (12.8%) and Black people (9.7%) also were higher than the rate for their White counterparts (6.5%). These differences in uninsured rates are driven by lower rates of private coverage among these groups. Medicaid coverage helps to narrow these differences but does not fully offset them.\nMedicaid and CHIP coverage help fill gaps in private coverage and reduce coverage disparities for children, but some disparities in children’s coverage remain (Figure 2). Medicaid and CHIP cover larger shares of children than adults, reflecting more expansive eligibility levels for children. This coverage helps fill gaps in private coverage, with over half of Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI children covered by Medicaid and CHIP. However, there remain some disparities in children’s coverage. For example, AIAN children are about three times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage (12.7% vs. 4.0%). Moreover, Hispanic children are more than twice as likely as White children to be uninsured (8.5% vs. 4.0%).\nAmong people under the age of 65, uninsured rates in states that have not expanded Medicaid are higher than rates in expansion states across most racial and ethnic groups as of 2023 (Figure 3). The differences in coverage rates between Black and Hispanic people compared with White people are larger in non-expansion states compared with expansion states. However, the relative risk of being uninsured for Black, Hispanic, and Asian people compared with White people is similar in expansion and non-expansion states. For example, Hispanic people under the age of 65 years old are roughly 2.6 times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage in both expansion and non-expansion states. Uninsured rates for AIAN people are similar in expansion and non-expansion states. Overall, the differences in coverage by expansion status are primarily driven by differences in coverage rates among adults ages 18-64. However, White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and NHPI children in non-expansion states also are more likely to be uninsured than those in expansion states. For example, 13.5% of Hispanic children in non-expansion states are uninsured compared to 6.1% of Hispanic children in expansion states.\nEligibility for Coverage among the Uninsured as of 2023\nThere are opportunities to increase coverage by enrolling eligible people in Medicaid or Marketplace coverage, but eligibility varies across racial and ethnic groups, and many remain ineligible for assistance. Overall, six in ten people who were uninsured in 2023 were eligible for financial assistance either through Medicaid or through subsidized Marketplace coverage, while the remaining four in ten were not eligible because they fell in the Medicaid coverage gap in states that have not expanded Medicaid, they were deemed to have access to an affordable Marketplace plan or offer of employer coverage, or they were ineligible due to their immigration status. However, the share of the remaining uninsured eligible for assistance varied by race and ethnicity. For example, uninsured Black people under age 65 were more likely than their White counterparts to fall in the coverage gap in states that have not expanded Medicaid, and uninsured Hispanic and Asian people under age 65 were less likely than White people to be eligible for coverage options, in part, reflecting higher shares of noncitizens who face immigrant eligibility restrictions among these groups (Figure 4).\nUninsured Black people under age 65 are more likely than their White counterparts to fall in the Medicaid “coverage gap” because a greater share live in states that have not implemented the Medicaid expansion. As of November 2024, 10 states have not adopted the ACA provision to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes through 138% of poverty. Most of these states are in the South, where a higher share of the Black population resides (Figure 5). In these states, 1.4 million uninsured people with incomes under poverty fall into the “coverage gap” and do not qualify for either Medicaid or premium subsidies in the ACA Marketplace.\nUninsured Asian, Black, Hispanic, and NHPI people under age 65 are less likely than their White counterparts to be eligible for coverage because they include larger shares of noncitizens who are subject to eligibility restrictions for Medicaid and Marketplace coverage (Figure 6). Lawfully present immigrants face eligibility restrictions for Medicaid coverage, with many having to wait five years after obtaining lawful status before they are eligible to enroll in Medicaid. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in Medicaid and are prohibited from purchasing coverage through the Marketplaces.\nLooking Ahead\nPolicies implemented amid the COVID-19 pandemic helped stabilize coverage and contributed to gains in coverage during this period. The coverage gains experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic were largely driven by an increase in Medicaid coverage, which offset declines in employer-sponsored coverage. As noted, temporary continuous enrollment provisions stabilized Medicaid coverage during the PHE, contributing to increases in enrollment. Additionally, the temporary enhanced subsidies for Marketplace coverage provided under ARPA, which were extended through 2025 under the IRA, also contributed to coverage gains. However, even with these gains, disparities in coverage remained.\nSince the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision ended in March 2023, millions of people have been disenrolled. While there is limited data available on disenrollments by race and ethnicity, research suggests that Black and Hispanic people were two times more likely than White people to lose Medicaid due to being unable to complete the renewal process during the unwinding period. Many people who were disenrolled from Medicaid could find low-cost coverage on the ACA Marketplaces, including, in some cases, coverage with a zero (or near-zero) monthly premium requirement. However, others became uninsured. In focus groups, adults who were disenrolled from Medicaid reported losing coverage for a variety of reasons, including because they were no longer eligible; however, some believed they were still eligible and did not know why they were disenrolled. Many reported facing communication problems with their Medicaid agencies, and some who were disenrolled indicated that they faced gaps in coverage before reenrolling in Medicaid or became uninsured, which contributed to high out-of-pocket costs and difficulties accessing care that negatively impacted their health.\nGoing forward, racial and ethnic disparities in coverage could widen due to potential Medicaid cuts, expiration of the enhanced subsidies for Marketplace coverage, and immigration policy changes. The incoming Trump administration and Republican controlled Congress are signaling plans to make significant changes to Medicaid and the ACA. House Republicans appear to be considering large cuts to Medicaid, which could help offset the cost of extending expiring tax cuts but would shift a substantial amount of Medicaid spending from the federal government to states, and likely lead states to make reductions in eligibility and/or benefits. Further, if Congress does not take action to extend the enhanced ACA Marketplace subsidies, which are set to expire in 2025, premiums will rise, likely leading to an increase in the number of uninsured people. Additionally, the Trump administration’s changes to immigration policy, including increased enforcement, the rescission of protections from enforcement activity in sensitive locations including health care facilities, and potential changes to public charge policy, will likely lead to reduced enrollment in health coverage of lawfully present immigrants and citizen children in immigrant families. Medicaid and Marketplace coverage losses would likely lead to widening racial disparities in coverage given that disproportionately large shares of Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI people are covered through these sources, which, in turn, would likely contribute to widening disparities in health.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        How New Federal Legislation Will Affect Health Care Costs and Access for Americans\nTwo health policy experts explain provisions in the 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that affect Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act.\nSigned into law on July 4, the 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act—also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act—includes sweeping changes to who is eligible for health insurance in the U.S.\nThe law, which the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates will result in up to 15 million more people without health insurance in 2034, includes over $1 trillion in spending cuts to health care through 2034. ”It is the biggest cut to our social safety net in history,” says Liz Fowler, PhD ’96, JD, distinguished scholar in Health Policy and Management.\nThe majority of the cuts impact federal support for Medicaid, the public insurance program that helps cover medical costs for low-income families, older adults, and people with disabilities. The law also changes who is eligible to receive Medicaid and Medicare benefits or access Affordable Care Act plans—which, Fowler says, could increase health care costs for all Americans.\nIn this Q&A, Fowler and Gerard Anderson, PhD, professor in Health Policy and Management, explain what changes will occur and when, who will be affected, and what people can do in the months ahead to prepare.\nImpacts to Medicaid\nHow does the new law affect Medicaid eligibility?\nGerard Anderson: The most significant change is the new federal work requirement, referred to in the law as a “community engagement requirement.” Most people who receive Medicaid will need to spend at least 80 hours a month working, volunteering, or in school. In order to maintain their coverage, Medicaid recipients will have to verify every month that they have met this requirement, which will create a large burden on both the individual recipients and the state systems managing coverage.\nWhen do the new work requirements take effect?\nGA: These new requirements will begin to take effect starting January 1, 2027.\nWho does the Medicaid work requirement law apply to? Who is exempt?\nGA: The requirement applies to all “able-bodied” Medicaid recipients ages 19–64, but there are numerous reasons someone would be exempt, including:\n- They have a child age 13 or younger or a child who is disabled.\n- They are a caregiver for a disabled relative.\n- They have a disability or health condition that prevents them from fulfilling the requirement.\nWhy are these new work requirements expected to result in so many people losing access to Medicaid coverage?\nGA: There are a few reasons these requirements could result in people losing coverage.\nFirst, most Americans on Medicaid are located in geographic areas where there is no school, there are no jobs, and there is nothing to volunteer for—especially not 80 or more hours a month. Others may be sufficiently incapacitated—even temporarily—that they can’t fulfill the requirement, thus losing their health care coverage due to illness.\nWe also expect that some people who qualify for Medicaid will not fill out the form every month. Some may forget. Others may not have a computer or internet access to complete the form reliably each month. Consider, for example, a person in rural Louisiana who has lost electricity because of a recent hurricane—or who can’t afford a mobile device or internet access—and still need to fill out this form each month to retain their health care.\nHow does someone determine whether they qualify for an exception from the work requirement?\nGA: While the work requirement is a federal law, Medicaid programs are regulated and operated at the state level. It is up to the states to interpret the law and determine how they will write the rules for their residents.\nHow states define who qualifies for Medicaid will matter a great deal—including what is considered “able-bodied” and the disabilities or other conditions that qualify for exceptions to the requirements. For example, someone who has trouble walking due to an injury or disability may not be able to work a job at a factory or a grocery store. A chronic illness that flares up unexpectedly could make it hard to hold a job long-term. Are those people entitled to coverage? I think most states believe so and will be pretty generous in their rules, but we don’t know yet.\nThe U.S. health system is like a balloon: When you squeeze one part of the balloon, the rest of the balloon stretches out.\n—Liz Fowler, distinguished scholar in Health Policy and Management\nWhat can people do now if they or a family member currently receives Medicaid or anticipate needing it in the future?\nGA: People should look at how their state’s rules are written. Some states, like Georgia, already have work requirements in place. Those that don’t have existing rules have until December 31, 2026, to interpret these federal guidelines and write their regulations—though states that show a “good faith effort to comply” can get exemptions through December 31, 2028.\nSo now is the time for people who rely on Medicaid to try to influence their state’s rules. They can reach out to state representatives or Medicaid directors to explain their specific situations—for example, a caregiving obligation or condition that prevents them from 80 hours of community engagement—and urge them to account for those in their eligibility rules.\nPeople who don’t anticipate qualifying for an exemption can also start planning ahead for how they’ll fill those required hours: Where might I be able to volunteer? If I can’t find a job, can I enroll in classes? Have a backup plan or workaround in place to ensure you can maintain coverage.\nOnce states have their rules and processes established, people should make a plan for filling out the form each month. Know where to find the form, when deadlines are, and what type of supporting documentation you might need to provide.\nImpacts to Medicare\nHow does the new law affect Medicare?\nGA: Two very important changes will result from this law: reduced support for people with Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) coverage and loss of Medicare coverage for noncitizens.\nWho is affected by Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) changes?\nGA: About 40% of Medicare beneficiaries receive low-income subsidies, a cost-sharing program within Medicare Part D that makes prescription drugs more affordable. This law reduces the amount of the premium support these beneficiaries receive. This means LIS recipients will pay more for prescriptions.\nLiz Fowler: Medicare Savings Program (MSP) enrollments will also be affected. A 2023 CMS rule that was set to take effect this past fall would have streamlined the process for enrolling in an MSP and retaining coverage. This legislation blocks that rule from being implemented until 2034. This delay will impact low-income individuals who need this cost-sharing support to afford things like prescription drugs, medical supplies, hospital stays, and nursing facility care.\nJust because you have insurance coverage through your employer doesn't mean you won't be impacted by this new legislation.\nWhat will this legislation mean for immigrants’ access to health care?\nGA: Currently, immigrants with legal status can meet eligibility requirements to qualify for Medicare. The new legislation restricts eligibility to only U.S. citizens, green card holders, and legal immigrants from a few specific locations. This means that even immigrants who have followed the rules—including refugees, people granted asylum, people with temporary protected status, and even permanent residents—will lose coverage.\nImpacts to the Affordable Care Act\nHow does the new law affect health care plans through the Affordable Care Act?\nLF: The law is going to make it more difficult to enroll in coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace, also known as Obamacare, and then harder to keep coverage, due to a few changes:\n- Enrollees will need to update information around their income, immigration status, and other details every year, or risk losing coverage.\n- Plans are no longer automatically renewed. Individuals will have to manually reenroll every year during open enrollment. Last year, 10 million people were automatically reenrolled.\n- The open enrollment period has been shortened by a month—now ending December 15, rather than January 15. For the current plan year, 40% of people signed up after December 15.\n- New enrollees—including those who enroll outside of open enrollment due to a life event or income change—will need to prove eligibility before they can receive subsidies that help offset the cost of their monthly premium. This is a change from the current policy, which allows applicants to get up to 90 days of premium assistance during the application process.\nIt’s also likely to drive up the cost of ACA plans, due to what’s not in the law: The law does not extend the ACA premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of this year. Without those, premiums are predicted to increase for 2026 by an average of 75%.\nHow are states responding to these policy changes?\nLF: Some states have been proactive in communicating the impact this law will have on people in their state. Pennsylvania, for example, has provided a detailed analysis of what’s going to happen in that state by income and geography if premium tax credits are not extended.\nIf state officials are concerned about the impending premium increases, they can urge Congress to extend premium tax credits for next year.\nWhat can people do now to make sure they retain their coverage and aren’t caught off-guard by changes?\nLF: People who are currently enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans and want to keep that coverage should plan ahead as much as possible so they’re ready when open enrollment begins on November 1:\n- Keep an eye on your state’s Marketplace website for information about the new law and any details that might apply to your current plan.\n- Gather the information you’ll need to verify eligibility during open enrollment.\n- Be prepared to reenroll by December 15.\nEven if you’re happy with your current plan, I recommend shopping around once open enrollment begins. The premium for the plan you’re enrolled in today could increase significantly, and you may need to do additional research before reenrolling.\nWhat will this legislation mean for immigrants’ eligibility for ACA coverage?\nLF: Similar to the new Medicare restrictions, the law also excludes some lawfully present immigrants—refugees, asylees, and those with temporary protected status—from eligibility for subsidized ACA Marketplace as of January 1, 2027. It also makes DACA recipients ineligible to purchase ACA Marketplace coverage in all states, and the CMS rule finalized last month puts this restriction into effect even sooner, ending DACA eligibility for ACA coverage on August 25, 2025.\nBroader Impacts to Health Care Access in the U.S.\nHow will these changes affect hospitals?\nGA: Medicaid represents about 20% of hospital revenue. For some, especially in some rural locations, it’s more like 40%–50% of their revenue. And many rural hospitals are teetering on the edge already.\nIf a person who has lost their Medicaid coverage comes into the emergency department, the hospital is still required to treat them, according to the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act. That person is not going to be able to pay out of pocket, so that debt becomes a loss for the hospital.\nHow hospitals will respond and recover is uncertain. That said, many hospitals are clever and they find ways to get more funds or reduce expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office is not allowed to assume behavior changes like these when they make their predictions, so I am hopeful the impact will not be as bad as they have predicted.\nWill the rural hospital funding included in the legislation help mitigate this?\nLF: The legislation set aside $50 billion to help rural hospitals deal with the fallout from the legislation—things like newly uninsured patients, increased costs, and increased premiums. I don't think it's possible for that funding to make up for the potentially seismic shifts that could start taking place very soon.\nThis law cut more than $1 trillion in health spending. That level of health care cuts is unprecedented—it is the biggest cut to our social safety net in history. $50 billion represents a small fraction of those cuts.\nHow will these changes impact people who don’t get health insurance through the ACA, Medicaid, or Medicare?\nLF: The U.S. health system is like a balloon: When you squeeze one part of the balloon, the rest of the balloon stretches out.\nJust because you have insurance coverage through your employer doesn't mean you won't be impacted by this new legislation. If hospitals start to see an increase in the number of uninsured people who aren’t able to pay their bills, they’re going to increase rates for other payers. It’s just not possible for 10–15 million people to lose health insurance and not have effects on the rest of the system.\nAll the parts of our health system are interrelated, and we all pay the cost for a health system that isn’t functioning the way it should.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Key Facts about the Uninsured Population\nIssue Brief\nThe pandemic-era coverage policies, including the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision and the enhanced Marketplace subsidies, continued to impact health coverage in the U.S. in 2023. During the pandemic, the coverage expansions put in place by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including Medicaid expansion and subsidized Marketplace coverage, served as a safety net for people who experienced economic and coverage disruptions. Gains in Medicaid and Marketplace coverage contributed to significant declines in the uninsured rate through 2022. Although states began the process of unwinding continuous enrollment in Medicaid in April 2023 and resumed disenrolling people from Medicaid, the full effect of Medicaid disenrollments were not felt in 2023. In addition, the enhanced Marketplace subsidies, which were extended through 2025, remained in place. Both these factors contributed to maintaining most of the coverage gains experienced during the pandemic period in 2023.\nThis issue brief describes trends in health coverage in 2023, examines the characteristics of the uninsured population ages 0-64, and summarizes the access and financial implications of not having coverage. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), this analysis examines changes in health coverage from 2022 to 2023 and compares data for 2023 to data for 2019 to report on coverage trends during the pandemic and through the start of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision. Because of disruptions in data collection during the pandemic, the Census Bureau did not release 1-year ACS estimates in 2020. The analysis focuses on coverage among people ages 0-64 since Medicare offers near universal coverage for people ages 65 and older, with just 457,000, or less than 1%, of people over age 65 uninsured.\nKey Takeaways\n- How many people are uninsured: Despite the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision that began in April 2023, the number of people ages 0-64 who were uninsured held steady at 25.3 million in 2023. However, the number of uninsured children increased from 3.8 million in 2022 to 4.0 million in 2023. Compared to 2019, the number of people who were uninsured declined by 3.6 million.\n- Who is uninsured: Most uninsured people are in low-income families and have at least one worker in the family. Reflecting the more limited availability of public coverage in some states, adults ages 19-64 are more likely to be uninsured than children. Despite gains across groups over time, racial and ethnic disparities in coverage persist.\n- Why are people uninsured: Many uninsured people cite the high cost of insurance as the main reason they lack coverage. In 2023, 63% of uninsured adults ages 18-64 said that they were uninsured because the cost of coverage was too high. Many uninsured people do not have access to coverage through a job, and some people, particularly poor adults in states that have not expanded Medicaid, remain ineligible for financial assistance for coverage. Although over half of people who are uninsured may be eligible for Medicaid or subsidized coverage in the Marketplaces, they may not be aware of these coverage options or may face barriers to enrolling. In some cases, even with subsidies, Marketplace coverage may not be affordable.\n- How does not having coverage affect health care access: People without insurance coverage are less likely to access care and more likely to delay or forgo care because of costs. Although difficult to establish direct causality, research has linked Medicaid expansion to improved health outcomes, including lower mortality rates from cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and maternal mortality.\n- What are the financial implications of being uninsured: Uninsured people often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. Nearly half (49%) of uninsured adults say they have difficulty affording health care costs, more than double the share of those with private insurance (21%). These costs can quickly translate into medical debt since most people who are uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings. More than six in ten (62%) uninsured adults report having health care debt compared to over four in ten (44%) insured adults.\nAlthough coverage rates for the overall population ages 0-64 held steady in 2023, future changes to Medicaid and Marketplace coverage could have a significant impact on health coverage. Proposals that would alter how Medicaid is financed or that would impose work requirements on certain adults enrolled in the program would likely lead to a loss of Medicaid coverage. Moreover, the temporary enhanced Marketplace subsidies will expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. Without a permanent extension, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the number of uninsured people will increase by 3.8 million, on average, in each year from 2026 to 2034. The combined Medicaid and Marketplace coverage losses could lead to a sizable increase in the number of people who are uninsured. In turn, the loss of coverage could have implications for access to care and financial stability associated with having health coverage and could lead to a worsening of disparities in health outcomes.\nHow many people are uninsured?\nAmong the population ages 0-64, both the number of uninsured (25.3 million) and the uninsured rate (9.5%) remained at historic lows in 2023. A continued decline in the number of uninsured adults ages 19-64 was offset by an increase in the number of uninsured children. Compared to 2019, prior to the start of the pandemic, the number of uninsured and the uninsured rate for the population ages 0-64 were both significantly lower in 2023. Nearly all groups experienced coverage gains, but American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) and Hispanic people had larger gains than their White counterparts and low-income individuals and those in working families had bigger gains than those at higher incomes and those without a worker in the family.\nKey Details:\n- In 2023, 25.3 million people ages 0 to 64 were uninsured, and the uninsured rate for this population was 9.5%, both statistically unchanged from 2022. While the uninsured rate held steady from 2022, it was lower than in 2019 (10.9%) prior to the start of the coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1).\n- From 2019-2023, the uninsured rate declined by 1.4%, driven primarily by gains in Medicaid and Marketplace coverage because of pandemic-era coverage protections. The Medicaid continuous enrollment provision required states to keep people enrolled in Medicaid during the pandemic in exchange for enhanced federal funding and enhanced ACA Marketplace subsidies, first enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and renewed through 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Although the enhanced Marketplace subsidies remained in effect in 2023, Medicaid continuous enrollment ended on March 31, 2023, and states resumed disenrolling people from Medicaid, though the full effects of the disenrollments were not felt in 2023. During this time period, employer coverage declined by 0.5% (Figure 2).\n- While there was no change in the uninsured rate for the overall population ages 0 to 64 in 2023, the share of children 18 and younger without insurance increased from 5.1% in 2022 to 5.3% in 2023. At the same time, the uninsured rate for adults ages 19 to 64 decreased to 11.1% in 2023 from 11.3% the previous year (Figure 2). An increase in Medicaid coverage for adults 19-64 from 16.3% to 16.5% in 2023 drove the decline in the uninsured rate for this group. Despite the uptick in the uninsured rate for children in 2023, the share of children without health insurance coverage was still lower in 2023 compared to 2019.\n- Although nearly all groups experienced coverage gains during the pandemic-period, they were largest for AIAN and Hispanic people and individuals in low-income families. From 2019 to 2023, the uninsured rate for AIAN people fell 3.0 percentage points (from 21.7% to 18.7%) and the uninsured rate for Hispanic people decreased by 2.1 percentage points (from 20.0% to 17.9%), although these groups remain more likely to be uninsured than their White counterparts. Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) people did not experience a significant decline in the uninsured rate during this period, which may, in part, reflect the smaller sample size for NHPI people, which limits the power to detect statistically significant differences. While the uninsured rate dropped for people at all income levels, individuals in low-income families1 experienced the largest declines. From 2019-2023, the uninsured rate for poor individuals dropped 2.2 percentage points (18.0% to 15.8%) and 2.7 percentage points for individuals with income 100-199% FPL (18.2% to 15.5%, Figure 3).\n- From 2022 to 2023, the uninsured rate for the population ages 0 to 64 fell in six states (Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, North Dakota, and Oregon) but increased in two states, Iowa and Idaho (Appendix Table A). At the same time, the uninsured rate for children increased in six states (Alabama, Idaho, New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington). While these changes occurred in both expansion and non-expansion states, the uninsured rate was lower in expansion states (7.6%) compared to non-expansion states (14.1%) in 2023 (Figure 6).\nWho is uninsured?\nMost of the 25.3 million people ages 0-64 who are uninsured are adults, in working low-income families, and are people of color. Reflecting geographic variation in income and the availability of public coverage, most uninsured people live in the South or West. In addition, most who are uninsured have been without coverage for long periods of time. (See Appendix Table B for detailed data on characteristics of the uninsured population.)\nKey Details:\n- In 2023, of the total uninsured population ages 0 to 64, nearly three in four (73.7%) had at least one full-time worker in their family, and 11.2% had a part-time worker in their family (Figure 4). More than eight in ten (80.9%) uninsured people were in families with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level, and nearly half (46.6%) had incomes below 200% FPL. White people made up 37.1% of the uninsured, and the remaining 62.9% included Hispanic (41.1%), Black (12.5%), and Asian (3.7%) people and people of other racial or ethnic backgrounds (Figure 4). Most uninsured individuals (74.2%) were U.S. citizens, while 25.8% were noncitizens. Almost three-quarters (73.9%) of uninsured people lived in the South or West.\n- Adults ages 19 to 64 are more likely to be uninsured than children. In 2023, the uninsured rate for children was 5.3%, less than half the rate for adults at 11.1%.\n- Uninsured rates in the U.S. still show clear racial and ethnic disparities. In 2023, 17.9% of Hispanic people and 18.7% of AIAN people ages 0 to 64 were uninsured—more than two and a half times the rate for White people (6.5%). Asian individuals had the lowest uninsured rate at 5.8%.\n- Noncitizens are more likely than citizens to be uninsured. Nearly one-third of noncitizen immigrants were uninsured in 2023, while the uninsured rate for U.S.-born citizens was 7.5% and 8.9% for naturalized citizens. (Appendix Table B).\n- Uninsured rates vary by state and by region; individuals living in non-expansion states are more likely to be uninsured (Figure 6). Six of the ten states with the highest uninsured rates in 2023 were non-expansion states (Figure 5 and Appendix Table A).\n- Nearly two-thirds (64%) of people who were uninsured in 2023 have been without coverage for more than a year.2 People who have been without coverage for long periods may be particularly hard to reach through outreach and enrollment efforts.\nWhy are people uninsured?\nLack of access to affordable health coverage is the main reason many people say they are uninsured. A majority of working age adults in the U.S. obtain health insurance through an employer; however, not all workers are offered employer-sponsored coverage or, if offered, can afford their share of the premiums. Medicaid covers many low-income individuals, especially children, but Medicaid eligibility for adults remains limited in most states that have not adopted the ACA expansion. Marketplace subsidies make coverage more affordable for many, but even subsidized Marketplace coverage can be unaffordable for some, and few people can afford to purchase private coverage without financial assistance.\nKey Details:\n- Cost is the most commonly cited reason for being uninsured. In 2023, 63.2% of uninsured adults ages 18-64 said they were uninsured because coverage is not affordable (Figure 7). Other reasons included not being eligible for coverage (27.0%), not needing or wanting coverage (26.6%), and signing up being too difficult (23.9%).\n- Not all workers have access to coverage through their job. In 2023, 64.7% of uninsured workers worked for an employer that did not offer them health benefits.3 Among uninsured workers who are offered coverage by their employers, cost is often a barrier to taking up the offer. From 2014 to 2024, total premiums for family coverage increased by 52%, outpacing wage growth, and the worker’s share increased by 31%.4 Low-income families with employer-based coverage spend a significantly higher share of their income toward premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses compared to those with income above 200% FPL.5 Particularly among people working for small employers , premium contributions for dependents can be unaffordable.\n- Medicaid eligibility varies across states and eligibility for adults is limited in states that have not expanded Medicaid. As of December 2024, 41 states including DC had adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion. Two states implemented the expansion in 2023—South Dakota in July and North Carolina in December. In states that have not expanded Medicaid, the median eligibility level for parents is just 34% FPL and adults without dependent children are ineligible in most cases. Additionally, in non-expansion states, millions of poor uninsured adults fall into a “coverage gap” because they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits.\n- Many lawfully present immigrants must meet a five-year waiting period after receiving qualified immigration status before they can qualify for Medicaid. States have the option to cover eligible children and pregnant people without a waiting period, and as of May 2024, 37 states have elected the option for children and 31 states have taken up the option for pregnant individuals. Lawfully present immigrants, including those who are not eligible for Medicaid because they have not met the five-year waiting period, are eligible for Marketplace tax credits. However, Some states have taken steps to provide fully state-funded coverage to some or all immigrants who are not eligible for federal coverage.\n- Though financial assistance is available under the ACA to many of the remaining uninsured, not everyone who is uninsured is eligible for free or subsidized coverage. Nearly six in ten (14.5 million) uninsured individuals in 2023 were eligible for financial assistance either through Medicaid or through subsidized Marketplace coverage (Figure 8). However, over four in ten uninsured (10.9 million) are outside the reach of the ACA because their state did not expand Medicaid, they have an ineligible immigration status, or they were deemed to have access to an affordable Marketplace plan or offer of employer coverage.\nHow does not having coverage affect health care access?\nHealth insurance makes a difference in whether and when people get necessary medical care, where they get their care, and ultimately, how healthy they are. Uninsured adults are far more likely than those with insurance to postpone health care or forgo it altogether because of concerns over costs. The consequences can be severe, particularly when preventable conditions or chronic diseases go undetected.\nKey Details:\n- Uninsured adults are more likely to forgo needed care than their insured counterparts. In 2023, nearly half (46.6%) of uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 reported not seeing a doctor or health care professional in the past 12 months compared to 15.6% with private insurance and 14.2% with public coverage. Part of the reason for not accessing care among uninsured individuals is that many (42.8%) do not have a regular place to go when they are sick or need medical advice (Figure 9). But cost also plays a role. Over one in five (22.6%) adults without coverage said that they went without needed care in the past year because of cost compared to 5.1% of adults with private coverage and 7.7% of adults with public coverage. A KFF survey that asks about cost barriers for individuals and their family members reports higher percentages of both uninsured and insured people delaying or forgoing needed care due to cost.\n- Uninsured children were also more likely than those with private insurance or public insurance to go without needed care due to cost in 2023 (9.5% compared to 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively). Furthermore, over a quarter (27.4%) of uninsured children had not seen a doctor in the past year, compared to 4.8% of children with public coverage and 3.7% of those with private coverage (Figure 9).\n- Studies repeatedly demonstrate that uninsured individuals are less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and services for major health conditions and chronic diseases.6 ,7 ,8 ,9 Because people without health coverage are less likely than those with insurance to have regular outpatient care, they are more likely to be hospitalized for avoidable health problems and to experience declines in their overall health. When they are hospitalized, uninsured people receive fewer diagnostic and therapeutic services and also have higher mortality rates than those with insurance.10 ,11 ,12 ,13 ,14\n- Research demonstrates that gaining health insurance improves access to health care considerably and diminishes the adverse effects of having been uninsured. A review of research on the effects of the ACA Medicaid expansion finds that expansion led to positive effects on access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population.\n- More recent research generally shows Medicaid expansion is associated with improved health outcomes, although establishing direct causality between health insurance and health outcomes is complex. For example, Medicaid expansion is associated with increased early-stage diagnosis rates for cancer, lower rates of cardiovascular mortality, and increased odds of tobacco cessation.15 ,16 Medicaid expansion has also been linked to lower mortality rates, including those from cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and maternal mortality.17 ,18 Evidence suggests it also aids long-term recovery for substance use disorders and improves treatment management for conditions such as diabetes and HIV.\n- Public hospitals, community clinics and health centers, and local providers that serve underserved communities provide an important health care safety net for uninsured people. However, safety net providers have limited resources and service capacity, and not all uninsured people have geographic access to a safety net provider.19 ,20 ,21 High uninsured rates contribute to rural hospital closures and greater financial challenges for rural hospitals, leaving individuals living in rural areas at an even greater disadvantage to accessing care.22 ,23 Research indicates that Medicaid expansion is associated with reductions in uncompensated care costs and improved financial performance for rural hospitals and other providers.\nWhat are the financial implications of being uninsured?\nUninsured individuals often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. These bills can quickly translate into medical debt since most people who are uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings.\nKey Details:\n- Those without insurance for an entire calendar year pay for almost 40% of their care out-of-pocket.24 In addition, hospitals frequently charge uninsured patients higher rates than those paid by private health insurers and public programs.25 ,26 ,27 ,28\n- Uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 are much more likely than their insured counterparts to lack confidence in their ability to afford usual medical costs. Nearly half (49%) of uninsured adults said they or a family member had problems paying for health care compared to 21% of insured adults, and over eight in ten (84%) uninsured adults said they worried that health care costs would put them in debt or increase their existing debt, compared to 71% of adults with insurance (Figure 10).\n- Unaffordable medical bills can lead to medical debt, particularly for uninsured adults. More than six in ten (62%) uninsured adults report having health care debt compared to over four in ten (44%) insured adults. Uninsured adults are more likely to face negative consequences due to health care debt, such as using up savings, having difficulty paying other living expenses, or borrowing money.29 ,30 ,31\n- While federal and state laws require certain hospitals to provide some level of charity care, not all eligible patients benefit from these programs. Consequently, charity care costs represent a small share of operating expenses at many hospitals.\n- Research suggests that gaining health coverage improves the affordability of care and financial security among the low-income population. Multiple studies of the ACA found declines in trouble paying medical bills and reductions in medical debt in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. More recent research found that Medicaid expansion decreased catastrophic health expenditures and was associated with greater increases in income among low-income individuals.\nAppendix\nSupplemental Tables\nEndnotes\n- The Federal Poverty Level was $ 24,526 for a family of three in 2023. ↩︎\n- Cohen RA and Sohi IS. “Demographic Variation in Health Insurance Coverage: United States, 2023”, National Center for Health Statistics.

Buyer interest is at a minimum. And the stock market has been turbulent.\n“We are just flooded with inventory,” Ramos said.\nWhat she’s experiencing isn’t uncommon along the Suncoast.\nHome values in Sarasota and Manatee counties are falling faster than almost anywhere else in the country, signaling a sharp reversal in one of the nation’s most overheated housing markets and raising concerns about the broader economic health of the Suncoast.\nSarasota County saw a 7% decline over the past year, with Manatee close behind at 5%, according to the latest data from Zillow Home Value Index. DeSoto County’s home values decreased the least in our region, posting a 1% drop. The index represents the “typical” home value in a region by calculating the weighted average of the middle third of homes, according to Zillow.\nWhile neighboring Charlotte County recorded the steepest drop of any large county in the nation — those with 50,000 or more inhabitants — at 8%, the trend across Sarasota and Manatee is part of the same regional slump and stands in stark contrast to much of the rest of the United States, where values have remained flat or continued to rise.\nOn average, counties across the U.S. posted a 4.5% increase in home values over the past year, according to the Zillow data. Among large counties, the value rose an average of 3.6%\nThe figures mark a dramatic shift from just two years ago, when the Suncoast ranked among the hottest housing markets in the United States. Home prices surged by double digits annually between 2020 and 2022 as buyers from across the country flocked to the region during the pandemic-era migration boom.\nNow, after three years of rapid appreciation, the market is coming back down — and quickly.\nChris Jones, an economist at the University of South Florida and founder of Florida Economic Advisors, has been warning about unsustainable price growth since 2022, when home values in the region rose by more than 30% in a single year.\n“We’ve just seen prices basically get out of control over the course of the last seven to eight years,” Jones said. “And you know, we haven’t had a bubble like this since the bubble prior to the 2008-2009 market collapse.”\nUnlike that crash, which was driven by predatory lending and financial speculation, today’s downturn stems from a mix of affordability fatigue, economic uncertainty and shifts in buyer behavior — particularly among the retirees and investment-driven buyers who dominate the Suncoast real estate landscape.\nThis region is perhaps more vulnerable than most, Jones said, because a lot of the housing demand is tied to what he called “lifetime wealth” and investment. That includes not just retirees, but also seasonal residents and buyers whose purchasing power depends on the strength of their portfolios rather than their paychecks.\n“One of the first things that happens is when consumers don’t feel good about the future,” he said, “they put off making big ticket expenditures — things like homes, autos and stuff like that.”\nBuyers step back, sellers get squeezed\nRecent data from the Realtors Association of Sarasota and Manatee (RASM), which historically is bullish on housing, confirms what real-estate agents on the ground are already seeing: more listings, fewer sales and a growing inventory of unsold homes.\n“Across all property types, sales activity slowed compared to the previous year, while inventory levels grew, creating more options for buyers,” the RASM report stated. “Home prices showed signs of softening, with declines in median and average sale prices across most segments.”\nThis kind of market stagnation — where sellers are still pricing high but buyers are increasingly hesitant — often marks the early stages of a broader correction, economists say. And with inflation concerns, higher mortgage rates and shaky consumer confidence, there’s little to suggest a quick turnaround.\nA national survey from the University of Michigan shows consumer confidence has taken a sharp hit, with sentiment falling for the third straight month in February. The index dropped 12%—its steepest decline since the early days of the pandemic.\n“Notably, two-thirds of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, the highest reading since 2009,” the university’s Survey of Consumers noted.\nJones said he does not expect consumers to feel more certain about the economy anytime soon as President Donald Trump’s tariff policy injects more chaos into the picture.\nCondo law fallout adds fuel to the fire\nSome of the region’s housing woes may be overstated, though, driven largely by distortions in the condominium market rather than a broad-based collapse in home values, said Alex Krumm, a past president of RASM and broker/owner at NextHome Excellence.\nAfter the deadly collapse of the Surfside condo building in 2021, Florida lawmakers passed a sweeping reform law that requires condo buildings of three stories or more to undergo structural inspections and maintain fully funded reserves. Many older condo communities, particularly those along the coast, are now facing massive assessments to cover years of deferred maintenance.\nThat’s pushing some condo owners to sell at a discount — and scaring off potential buyers.\nKrumm said the new law is “putting a thumb on the scale,” driving down condo prices in ways that skew the overall housing picture.\n“It’s really a tale of two markets,” the veteran Realtor said.\nWhile the drop in prices might offer some hope for affordability, especially for first-time homebuyers, it also poses risks — particularly for those who bought near the peak. Homeowners who purchased in the last two years may now find themselves with properties worth less than their mortgage, a situation that can lead to financial strain or forced sales.\nLocal governments could also feel the impact. Property tax revenues are directly tied to real estate values, and if assessments fall, municipalities may be forced to adjust budgets or raise tax rates to compensate.\nAnd while many longtime residents may be content to ride out the dip, newer transplants and investors may be more inclined to cut their losses.\nThat creates volatility — not just in the housing market, but in the region’s overall economy, where construction, real estate and related services remain major drivers of employment.\nIs the bottom near?\nDespite the gloomy data, some in the industry believe a floor is in sight.\n“You can always tell the bottom is coming because you start to see obscene deals go through — deals that probably shouldn’t go through start to happen,” Krumm said. “You can also tell the top the same way. And we’re seeing those deals right now in real estate.”\nStill, there’s no consensus on exactly when the tide will turn. Much depends on national economic trends, interest rate policy and the confidence of buyers. If consumer sentiment remains weak, prices could continue to slide for a while.\nRamos, who became a Realtor about six years ago, said this is the first time she’s experienced a jolt in the market.\nShe’s redoubled her marketing efforts because of the stagnant buyer pool. She’s held more open houses, sent out more fliers and posted about her properties on social media.\n“It’s been tough. There’s no crystal ball,” she said. “People are afraid right now.”\nDespite her worries and the challenging market conditions, she’s also banking on the long-term trends.\n“What goes down must go back up,” she said. “It always does.”\nThis story was produced by Suncoast Searchlight, a nonprofit newsroom of the Community News Collaborative serving Sarasota, Manatee, and DeSoto counties.

While national unemployment among veterans is just 3.1%, millions still face housing insecurity and have trouble accessing healthcare and education. And where they live could be making matters worse.\nWalletHub compared the 100 largest U.S. cities across 19 key livability, affordability, and veteran support indicators to determine the best and worst places for veterans. The ranking examined everything from veteran unemployment and income growth to the availability of VA health facilities and military discounts at local businesses.\n“When veterans return home from serving our nation, it’s important for them to live in a place that provides good education and employment opportunities, along with access to quality care for their physical and mental health,” said WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo. “The best cities for veterans have all these characteristics, plus added bonuses like large veteran populations for community support, as well as restaurants and entertainment venues that offer veteran discounts.”\nContinue reading to see which cities made the list — and why.\n2 / 11\n5th Best: Colorado Springs, Colorado\nDee Liu / Getty Images\nColorado Springs rounds out the top five thanks to its strong job market and high earning potential for veterans. The city’s median veteran income tops $64,000, one of the highest in the nation, and its veteran unemployment rate is just 5.1%. It also boasts the largest veteran population per capita of any major U.S. city.\n3 / 11\n4th Best: Raleigh, North Carolina\ncarlofranco / Getty Images\nRaleigh’s median veteran income is over $61,000, supported by a healthy 17.9% job growth rate between 2020 and 2024. Veterans in Raleigh also benefit from one of the lowest homelessness rates nationwide and a strong network of VA services. While the city’s projected veteran population decline is smaller than most, Raleigh ranks high for family-friendliness and educational access.\n4 / 11\n3rd Best: Madison, Wisconsin\nhalbergman / Getty Images\nMadison has the fourth-fastest veteran income growth rate in the country, at roughly 9% annually, and one of the lowest homelessness rates, with only two homeless veterans per 1,000. Madison also offers the third-best colleges for veterans, contributing to its low unemployment and high-quality workforce. Plus, it has a median veteran income of about $60,000.\n5 / 11\n2nd Best: Tampa, Florida\nArt Wager / Getty Images\nTampa takes second place largely thanks to its outstanding access to VA health care and veteran benefits. The city ranks third for VA health facilities per capita and sixth for VA benefits offices, while its VA medical system earns the second-highest quality rating in the country. Veterans in Tampa also see incomes increasing 6.3% per year and a median income of $53,000.\n6 / 11\nBest: Austin, Texas\nadamkaz / Getty Images\nAustin tops WalletHub’s list as the best city in America for veterans. The city boasts the 10th-highest median income for veterans, at around $62,000, and some of the best colleges for veterans nationwide. Austin also ranks seventh for job growth and is projected to have one of the smallest declines in veteran population through 2053.\n7 / 11\n5th Worst: Toledo, Ohio\nPosnov / Getty Images\nToledo veterans are struggling. The median veteran income is just $40,000, among the lowest nationwide, and more than 14% of veterans live in poverty. The city also posts a higher veteran unemployment rate than average. Although housing affordability is decent, Toledo has seen a steep decline in its veteran population recently.\n8 / 11\n4th Worst: Memphis, Tennessee\n© Nina Dietzel / Getty Images\nMemphis faces challenges with job growth and income stability for veterans. The city has seen negative job growth since 2020 and a veteran unemployment rate of 8.2%. Median income for veterans is $47,000, and more than 12% live below the poverty line. Despite affordable housing, Memphis ranks near the bottom for retiree-friendliness, and its VA health care access and quality lag behind most other major cities.\n9 / 11\n3rd Worst: Baton Rouge, Louisiana\nEvren Trx / 500px / Getty Images\nBaton Rouge ranks low due to limited income growth and widespread economic hardship among its veteran population. With an average veteran income growth rate of just 0.6%, the city offers few opportunities for financial advancement. Nearly 13% of veterans live in poverty, and veteran homelessness remains a serious concern. Baton Rouge also faces one of the sharpest projected drops in veteran population, losing nearly half of its veterans by 2053.\n10 / 11\n2nd Worst: Detroit, Michigan\nStefania Pelfini la Waziya / Getty Images\nDetroit continues to struggle with severe economic challenges that hit veterans especially hard. The city has a veteran unemployment rate of 14.6%, one of the highest in the country, and the median veteran income is just $32,000. More than 23% of veterans live in poverty, and the veteran population is shrinking faster than nearly anywhere else. Despite improvements in city services, Detroit’s VA health resources and community support systems remain limited.\n11 / 11\nWorst: Newark, New Jersey\nNisian Hughes / Getty Images\nNewark ranks last among the 100 largest cities, burdened by poor economic conditions and limited veteran support infrastructure. The median veteran income is under $28,000, and nearly 19% live in poverty. Job growth for veterans remains stagnant, while the overall veteran population has fallen by nearly 59%. Newark’s health and quality-of-life scores are among the lowest, and the lack of accessible VA health facilities compounds the city’s challenges.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media.

Congratulations on your lucky break!\nJust remember that your good fortune includes a responsibility to pay taxes and fees on those winnings.\nGambling Winnings:\nIn 2018, Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that authorized legal sports betting in New Jersey. The law (A4111) allows people, age 21 and over, to place sports bets over the internet or in person at New Jersey's casinos, racetracks, and former racetracks. Sports betting is now among the many forms of gambling winnings that are subject to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax, including legalized gambling (sports betting, casino, racetrack, etc.) and illegal gambling.\nLottery:\nNew Jersey Lottery winnings from prize amounts exceeding $10,000 became subject to the Gross Income Tax in January 2009.\nWithholding Rate from Gambling Winnings\nNew Jersey Income Tax is withheld at an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the payout for both New Jersey residents and nonresidents (N.J.S.A. 54A:5.1(g)).\nWithholding Rate from Lottery Winnings\nThe rate is determined by the amount of the payout. If a prize is taxable (i.e., over $10,000), the entire amount of the payout is subject to withholding, not just the amount in excess of $10,000. The withholding rates for gambling winnings paid by the New Jersey Lottery are as follows:\nNew Jersey Income Tax withholding is based on the total amount of the prize won. For example, if two people win a New Jersey Lottery prize of $14,000 and split the proceeds equally, $7,000 of income is taxable to each person and is subject to the 5% withholding rate. Both taxpayers would be subject to the 5% withholding because the total amount of the prize exceeded $10,000.\nCompanies that obtain the right to Lottery payments from the winner and receive Lottery payments are also subject to New Jersey withholdings. Each company is required to file for a refund of the tax withheld, if applicable.\nLottery\nNew Jersey Lottery winnings from prize amounts exceeding $10,000 are taxable. The individual prize amount is the determining factor of taxability, not the total amount of Lottery winnings during the year.\nGambling and Lottery\nMaking Estimated Payments\nIf you will not have enough withholdings to cover your New Jersey Income Tax liability, you must make estimated payments to avoid interest and penalties. For more information on estimated payments, see GIT-8, Estimating Income Taxes .\nOut-of-State Sales:\nOut-of-state lottery winnings are taxable for New Jersey Gross Income Tax purposes regardless of the amount.\nGambling winnings from a New Jersey location are taxable to nonresidents. Gambling includes the activities of sports betting and placing bets at casinos and racetracks.\nCalculating Taxable Income\nYou may use your gambling losses to offset gambling winnings from the same year as long as they do not exceed your total winnings. If your losses were greater than your winnings, you cannot report the negative figure on your New Jersey tax return. You must claim zero income for net gambling winnings. For more information, see TB-20(R) , Gambling Winnings or Losses.\nYou may be required to substantiate gambling losses used to offset winnings reported on your New Jersey tax return. Evidence of losses can include your losing tickets, a daily log or journal of wins and losses, canceled checks, notes, etc. You are not required to provide a detailed rider of gambling winnings and losses with your New Jersey tax return. However, if you report gambling winnings (net of losses) on your New Jersey return, you must attach a supporting statement indicating your total winnings and losses.\nReporting Taxable Winnings\nInclude taxable New Jersey Lottery and gambling winnings in the category of “net gambling winnings” on your New Jersey Gross Income Tax return.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Department of Taxation and Finance\nInstructions for Form IT-203 Nonresident and Part-Year Resident Income Tax Return\nNew York State • New York City • Yonkers • MCTMT\n(including instructions for Forms IT-195, IT-203-ATT, and IT-203-B)\nIT-203-I\nPrinter-Friendly Version (PDF)\nGeneral information\nUp-to-date information affecting your tax return\nFor tax law changes or forms corrections that occurred after the forms and instructions were finalized, see Personal income tax up-to-date information or visit www.tax.ny.gov (search: corrections).\nWhat’s new for 2024\nFor a detailed list of what’s new, including a summary of tax law changes, see New for 2024 or visit www.tax.ny.gov (search: 2024).\nFile electronically\nElectronic preparation (e-file) is fast, easy, and secure.

Both spouses must sign the return and will generally be jointly and individually liable for the entire tax, penalty, or interest due. This means that if one spouse does not pay the tax due, the other may have to.\nIf you meet one of the preceding three conditions but are unable to file a joint New York return because:\n- the address or whereabouts of your spouse is unknown, you can demonstrate that reasonable efforts have been made to locate your spouse, and good cause exists for the failure to file a joint New York return; or\n- your spouse refuses to sign a joint New York return, reasonable efforts have been made to have your spouse sign a joint return, there exists objective evidence of alienation from your spouse such as judicial order of protection, legal separation under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, or living apart for the twelve months immediately preceding application to file a separate return or commencement of an action for divorce or commencement of certain family court proceedings, and good cause exists for the failure to file a joint New York return,\nyou may file a separate New York return using filing status ③.\nIf you filed a joint federal return and:\n- both spouses are nonresidents but only one has New York source income, or\n- one spouse is a part-year resident and the other is a nonresident with no New York source income,\nyou must file a joint New York State return using filing status ②‚ and include in the Federal amount column the joint income as reported on your federal income tax return. However, only the spouse with New York source income (or the part-year resident spouse) should sign Form IT-203. That spouse must also complete Form IT-203-C (see Other forms you may have to file), and submit it with your Form IT-203. In this case, any refund or notice of tax, penalty, or interest due will be issued only in the name of the spouse required to sign Form IT-203.\nIf you filed a joint federal return and one spouse is a New York State resident and the other is a nonresident or part-year resident, you are required to file separate New York State returns.

On your federal return, you report $35,000 in total wages. Of this amount, you earned $12,000 while you were a New York State resident. On line 1, you would enter $35,000 in Column A, $23,000 in Column B, $0 in Column C (you earned no income in New York State prior to the move), $12,000 in Column D, and $12,000 in Column E.\nExample 2: You moved from New York State to Georgia on June 10, 2024. On June 1, 2024, your employer awarded you a guaranteed bonus of $2,000 that it paid to you on July 1, 2024.

This is not necessarily the amount shown in the State wages, tips, etc. box on your Form(s) W-2. To correctly determine your income earned in New York State, use one of the following methods:\n- To allocate income that does not depend directly on the volume of business transacted (for example, wages), complete Schedule A, Allocation of wage and salary income to New York State, on Form IT-203-B to determine the amount earned in New York State.\n- To allocate income from a termination agreement, covenant not to compete, stock option, restricted stock, or stock appreciation right, complete Form IT-203-F to determine the amount to allocate to New York State.\n- To allocate income that depends entirely on the volume of business transacted, as in the case of a salesperson working on commission, divide your volume of business transacted in the state by your total volume of business transacted both in and out of New York State. (The location where the services or sales activities were actually performed determines where business is transacted.) Multiply your total income subject to allocation by this percentage. This is the amount allocated to New York State. Submit a schedule with your return showing how you calculated this allocation.\nIf you allocate your personal service income differently, submit a separate schedule showing complete details.\nIf you do not complete Schedule A of Form IT-203-B (and Form IT-203-F, if applicable) and submit it with your return, it will delay the processing of your return and could result in penalties and interest.\nLine 2: Taxable interest income\nFederal amount column\nEnter the amount you reported on your federal return.\nNew York State amount column\nEnter that part of the federal amount that you received as a nonresident from a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on in New York State.

You are not required to use the same method for all entities.\nDirect accounting method\nThe direct accounting method requires you to determine the actual amount of your share of income attributable to the period you were a resident and nonresident during the partnership’s, S corporation’s, or estate’s or trust’s tax year ending within your tax year. If you elect to use the direct accounting method, you must use the partnership’s, S corporation’s, or estate’s or trust’s method of accounting for federal income tax purposes to determine the amount attributable to each period. In addition, you must use the method for all items of income, gain, loss and deduction that are included in your distributive share of partnership income, your pro rata share of S corporation income, or your share of estate or trust income.\nProration method\nAllocate the items of income based on the number of days you were a resident and the number of days you were a nonresident during the partnership’s, S corporation’s, or estate’s or trust’s tax year which ends during your tax year. The portion attributable to your nonresident period is limited to the percentage of income derived from or connected with New York State sources. (Obtain this percentage from your partnership, S corporation, or estate or trust.) The following formula illustrates the calculation:\nExample 1: Sam Smith was a partner in partnership Q during 2024. Partnership Q’s tax year ends on December 31, 2024. Partnership Q carried on business both within and outside New York State and has determined that the partnership’s New York allocation percentage is 65%. For tax year 2024, the distributive share of income from partnership Q included in Sam’s Federal amount column on Form IT-203 was $40,000. Sam changed residence from New York State to New Jersey on September 30, 2024. Using Steps 1 through 3, the amount of partnership income that Sam Smith must include in New York source income (the New York State amount column) on Sam's 2024 Form IT-203, is calculated as follows:\nStep 1 (resident period)\n$40,000 × 274 (number of days from 1/1/2024 through 9/30/2024) ÷ 366 = $29,945.36\nStep 2 (nonresident period)\n$40,000 × 92 (number of days from 10/1/2024 through 12/31/2024) ÷ 366 = $10,054.64 × .65 = $6,535.52\nStep 3\nTotal amount to include in New York State amount column = $36,481\nExample 2: Tim Jones was a partner in partnership R during 2024. Partnership R’s tax year began on November 1, 2023, and ended on October 31, 2024. Partnership R carried on business both within and outside New York State and has determined the partnership’s New York allocation percentage is 60%. For tax year 2024, the distributive share of income from partnership R included in Tim’s Federal amount column on Form IT-203 was $65,000. Tim changed residence from New York State to Vermont on May 31, 2024. Using steps 1 through 3, the amount of partnership income that Tim Jones must include in New York source income (the New York State amount column) on Tim's 2024 Form IT-203, is calculated as follows:\nStep 1 (resident period)\n$65,000 × 213 (number of days from 11/1/2023 through 5/31/2024) ÷ 366 = $37,827.87\nStep 2 (nonresident period)\n$65,000 × 153 (number of days from 6/1/2024 through 10/31/2024) ÷ 366 = $27,172.13 × .60 = $16,303.28\nStep 3\nTotal amount to include in New York State amount column = $54,131\nLine 13: Farm income or loss\nFederal amount column\nEnter the amount you reported on your federal return. Submit a copy of your federal Schedule F (Form 1040).\nNew York State amount column\nEnter that part of the federal amount that represents income or loss from farming carried on in New York State as a nonresident.\nReporting farm income is similar to reporting business income. See the instructions for reporting business income on line 6, including the instructions for reporting when business is carried on both in and out of New York State.\nPart-year residents\nAlso add that part of the federal amount that you realized while you were a resident.\nLine 14: Unemployment compensation\nFederal amount column\nEnter the amount reported on your federal return.\nNew York State amount column\nEnter that part of the federal amount that represents taxable unemployment compensation you received as a nonresident resulting from employment in New York State. If the unemployment compensation received from New York State sources is based on wage or salary income earned partly in and partly out of New York State, determine the amount allocable to New York State in the same manner as the wage and salary income on which it is based.\nPart-year residents\nAlso add that part of the federal amount that you received while you were a resident.\nLine 15: Taxable amount of Social Security benefits\nFederal amount column\nEnter the amount of taxable Social Security (and Tier 1 railroad retirement benefits) you reported on your federal return. Also enter this amount on line 26.\nNew York State amount column\nDo not enter any amount you received as a nonresident.\nPart-year residents\nEnter that part of the federal amount that represents any taxable amount of Social Security (and Tier 1 railroad retirement benefits) you received while you were a New York State resident. Also enter this amount on line 26.\nLine 16: Other income\nFederal amount column\nEnter the total other income you reported on your federal return. Write each type of income and its amount in the Identify area on line 16. If you need more room, submit a list on a separate sheet of paper showing each type of income and its amount.\nNew York State amount column\nEnter that part of the federal amount you received as a nonresident that was derived from or connected with New York State sources.\nPart-year residents\nAlso add that part of the federal amount that you received while you were a New York State resident.\nSpecial rules\n- New York State lottery winnings\n- Nonresidents\nInclude prizes (not proceeds) won in the New York State Lottery if the total proceeds of the prize exceed $5,000.\nProceeds means the total amount of the prize (not the installment amount, if the prize is payable in installments), minus the cost to purchase just the winning ticket. If a group wins a prize, use the total prize (not each group member’s share) to determine if the proceeds exceed $5,000. - Part-year residents\nAlso add that part of the federal amount that you received while you were a resident.\nIn the case of a lottery prize you elected to receive on the installment basis, see Special accruals.\n- Nonresidents\nFor additional information, see Publication 140-W, FAQs: New York State Lottery Winners, What are my Tax Responsibilities for New York State?\n- Net operating loss (NOL)\nFor New York State income tax purposes, your NOL deduction is limited to the lesser of:\n- The amount of your federal NOL deduction derived from New York sources, or\n- your federal adjusted gross income from the New York State amount column (but not less than zero) calculated without the NOL deduction.\nFor additional information, see the instructions for Form IT-225, New York State Modifications, addition modification number A-215.\nIf you are carrying forward an NOL derived from New York sources (without a corresponding federal NOL), enter the amount of the loss in the New York State amount column with a minus sign. Submit a statement explaining the loss.\nPart-year residents\nAlso add that part of the federal amount, if any, that you incurred while you were a resident.\nLine 18: Total federal adjustments to income\nFederal amount column\nEnter the total adjustments to income you reported on your federal return. Write each adjustment and its amount in the Identify area on line 18. If you need more room, submit a list on a separate sheet of paper showing each adjustment and its amount.\nIf you did not have to file a federal return, claim the same adjustments to income that you would have claimed for federal income tax purposes.\nNew York State amount column\nEnter that part of the federal amount that represents adjustments related to income you received as a nonresident that was derived from or connected with New York State sources.\nPart-year residents\nAlso add that part of the federal adjustment deductible while you were a New York State resident.\nSpecial rules\n- Alimony paid\nYou must use the following formula to calculate the amount of the federal deduction allowed in the New York State amount column for alimony paid:\nNYS amount column, line 17\nFederal amount column, line 17x\nFederal alimony deduction\n=\nNew York alimony deduction*\nThe New York alimony deduction included on line 18 cannot exceed the alimony deduction you claimed on your federal return.\n*If this amount is a negative number, your New York alimony deduction is zero.\nNote: If you made any alimony or separate maintenance payments under an alimony or separation instrument (as defined in IRC § 71 as it was in effect immediately prior to the enactment of Public Law 115-97) that was executed after December 31, 2018, report such payments using Form IT-225, New York State Modifications. This also applies to any divorce or separation instrument executed on or before December 31, 2018, and modified after December 31, 2018, if the modification to the instrument expressly provides that the addition and subtraction modifications contained in Tax Law § 612(w) apply. For more information, see the instructions for Form IT-225. - Moving expenses for members of the armed forces\nFederal amount column\nEnter the amount you reported on your federal return.\nNew York State amount column\nInclude moving expenses that you incurred as a nonresident only if you moved to a new home in New York because military orders call for a permanent change of station. Do not include moving expenses you incurred if your permanent station is outside New York State.\nPart-year residents\nAlso add that part of the federal amount that you paid or incurred during your resident period.\nOther adjustments to income\nAllocate to New York State any other adjustment to income that relates to wage or salary income earned partly in New York State, or to income from a business carried on both in and out of New York State, on the same basis as the income to which it relates. Some of these adjustments include IRA deduction, one-half of self-employment tax, and self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans.\nExample: You are allowed an adjustment of $800 on your federal return for payments by a self-employed person to a retirement plan, and these payments were made in connection with a business you operated both in and out of New York State.\nIf, in determining your business income from New York State sources, you calculate your business allocation percentage on Form IT-203-A to be 75% (see the instructions for line 6), then 75% of this adjustment, or $600, should be included in the New York State amount column on line 18.\nLine 19: Federal adjusted gross income\nSubtract line 18 from line 17 in each column and enter the results on line 19. Generally, the Federal amount column will be the same as the adjusted gross income reported on your federal return. However, this amount will not be the same if you are subject to the special accruals, either as a full-year nonresident or part-year resident.\nDo not leave line 19 blank.\nStep 4: Calculate your New York additions and subtractions\nOverview\nThe calculation of your New York State income tax is based on your New York adjusted gross income. Your New York adjusted gross income is your federal adjusted gross income after certain New York additions and New York subtractions (modifications).\nNew York State taxes certain items of income not taxed by the federal government. You must add these New York additions to your federal adjusted gross income.\nSimilarly, New York State does not tax certain items of income taxed by the federal government. You must subtract these New York subtractions from your federal adjusted gross income. See below and Form IT-225, New York State Modifications, and its instructions.\nNonresidents\nYou must add or subtract these New York State additions or subtractions from your federal adjusted gross income in the Federal amount column. You must also add or subtract these in the New York State amount column to the extent they relate to income, loss, or deduction derived from or connected with New York State sources.\nNew York additions and subtractions that relate to intangible items of income, such as interest or ordinary dividends, are only required to the extent the property that generates the income is employed in a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on in New York State.\nPart-year residents\nIf you were a part-year resident, include the portion of any of the additions and subtractions that relate to your New York State resident period in the New York State amount column. Also, for the period you were a nonresident, include in the New York State amount column the portion of any of the additions and subtractions to the extent they are related to a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on in New York State or are from real or tangible personal property located in New York State.\nPartners and S corporation shareholders\nIf you have income from a partnership or S corporation, include any New York adjustments that apply to that income. The entity should provide you with this information. For important information regarding these modifications, see the instructions for Form IT-225.\nIf you have either of the addition or subtraction modifications in the chart, below, relating to your partnership or S corporation income, include the amount on the corresponding line of Form IT-203.\n| Modification code | Description | Line number |\n|---|---|---|\n| EA-113 | Interest income on state and local bonds and obligations | 20 |\n| ES-125 | Interest income on U.S. government bonds | 27 |\nFor all other additions and subtractions relating to your partnership and S corporation income, complete Form IT-225.\nBeneficiaries (estates and trusts)\nIf you have income from an estate or trust, any New York adjustments that apply to that income, as well as any additions to or subtractions from federal itemized deductions, will be shown in your share of a single fiduciary adjustment. You, as a nonresident beneficiary, must include your share of the total fiduciary adjustment in the Federal amount column.\nInclude in the New York State amount column only that portion of the nonresident beneficiary’s share of the fiduciary adjustment that relates to income, loss, or deduction derived from or connected with New York State sources. Submit a schedule showing how the fiduciary adjustment was calculated.\n- If the adjustment is a net addition, enter the amount and addition modification number EA-901 on line 5 of Form IT-225.\n- If the adjustment is a net subtraction, enter the amount and subtraction modification number ES-901 on line 14 of Form IT-225.\nWhen you have completed Form IT-225, transfer the amounts to Form IT-203 as instructed on Form IT-225.\nIf you filed federal Form 4970, Tax on Accumulation Distribution of Trusts:\n- do not include the income you reported on line 1 of Form 4970 on line 11 of Form IT-203 because the IRC considers the distribution part of federal gross income.\n- do include on your Form IT-225, line 5, the amount of income you reported on Form 4970, line 1, after subtracting any interest income on state and local bonds and obligations of New York State and its local governments that you included on Form 4970, line 5. See addition modification number A-114 in the instructions for Form IT-225.\nNew York additions\nLine 20: Interest income on state and local bonds and obligations\nDo you have interest income from state and local bonds and obligations from states other than New York State or its local governments?\n- If No, go to line 21.\n- If Yes, see below.\nFederal amount column\nIf Yes, enter any such interest income that you received or that was credited to you during 2024 that was not included in your federal adjusted gross income. This includes interest income on:\n- state and local bonds,\n- interest and dividend income from tax-exempt bond mutual funds, and\n- tax-exempt money market funds that invest in obligations of states other than New York.\nIf you purchased a bond between interest dates, include the amount of interest you received during the year, after subtracting the seller’s accrued interest (the amount accrued from the interest date preceding your purchase to the date you purchased the bond). You should have received this information when you purchased the bond.\nIf you sold a bond between interest dates, include the amount of interest you received during the year plus the accrued interest amount (the amount accrued from the interest date preceding the date you sold the bond to the date you sold the bond). You should have received this information when you sold the bond.\nNew York State amount column\nDo not make this addition for any period you were a nonresident unless the addition is attributable to a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on in New York State.\nIf you were a part-year resident, you must also add the part of the federal amount that you received or that was credited to you for the period you were a resident.\nFor purposes of this addition, bond premium amortization is not allowed as a direct offset to interest income. You must report it:\n- as a subtraction modification on Form IT-225—if the bond premium is attributable to a trade or business, or\n- as an itemized deduction addition adjustment on Form IT-196, line 44—if the bond premium is not attributable to a trade or business, but only if you itemize.\nLine 21: Public employees 414(h) retirement contributions\nAre you a public employee of New York State or its local governments?\n- If No, go to line 22.\n- If Yes, enter in both the Federal amount column and the New York State amount column the amount of 414(h) retirement contributions, if shown on any wage and tax statement, federal Form W-2, if you are:\n- a member of the New York State and Local Retirement Systems, which include the New York State Employees’ Retirement System and the New York State Police and Fire Retirement System;\n- a member of the New York State Teachers’ Retirement System;\n- an employee of the State or City University of New York who belongs to the Optional Retirement Program;\n- a member of the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the New York City Teachers’ Retirement System, the New York City Board of Education Retirement System, the New York City Police Pension Fund or the NYC Fire Department Pension Fund; or\n- a member of the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority (MABSTOA) Pension Plan.\nDo not enter contributions to a section 401(k) deferred arrangement, section 403(b) annuity or section 457 deferred compensation plan.\nLine 22: Other additions\nUse this line to report other additions that are not specifically listed on Form IT-203.\nEnter on line 22, Federal amount column, the amount from Form IT-225, line 9.\nEnter on line 22, New York State amount column, the sum of the entries from Form IT-225, lines 1 and 5, column B.

See Publication 36.\nLine 27: Interest income on U.S. government bonds\nDid you include interest income from U.S. government bonds or other U.S. government obligations on lines 2, 6, or 11?\n- If No, go to line 28.\n- If Yes, enter in the Federal amount column and, if applicable, the New York State amount column the amount of interest income you earned from bonds or other obligations of the U.S. government.\nDividends you received from a regulated investment company (mutual fund) that invests in obligations of the U.S. government and meet the 50% asset requirement each quarter qualify for this subtraction. The portion of the qualifying dividends that may be subtracted is based upon the portion of the taxable income received by the mutual fund that is derived from federal obligations.\nContact the mutual fund for additional information on meeting the 50% asset requirement and calculating your allowable subtraction (if any).\nIf you include an amount on line 27 from more than one line on Form IT-203, submit a schedule on a separate sheet of paper showing the breakdown from each line.\nDo not list the same interest more than once on lines 27 and 29; see the instructions for Form IT-225, subtraction modification numbers S-121 and S-123.\nLine 28: Pension and annuity income exclusion\nDid you enter an amount of pension income or annuity income, or both (generally reported on line 9 or 10) that was not from a New York State or local government pension plan or federal government pension plan?\n- If No, go to line 29.\nFederal amount column:\n- If Yes, and you were 59½ years old before January 1, 2024, enter the qualifying pension and annuity income included in your 2024 federal adjusted gross income, but not more than $20,000.\nIf you became 59½ during 2024, enter only the amount you received after you became 59½, but not more than $20,000.\nIf you received pension and annuity income and are married, or received pension and annuity income as a beneficiary, see Married taxpayers or Beneficiaries below.\n$20,000 limit: You may not take a pension and annuity income exclusion that exceeds $20,000, regardless of the source of the income.\nQualifying pension and annuity income includes the following:\n- periodic payments for services you performed as an employee before you retired\n- periodic and lump-sum payments from an IRA, but not payments derived from contributions made after you retired\n- periodic distributions from government (IRC section 457) deferred compensation plans\n- periodic distributions from an annuity contract [IRC section 403(b)] purchased by an employer for an employee and the employer is a corporation, community chest, fund, foundation, or public school\n- periodic payments from an HR-10 (Keogh) plan, but not payments derived from contributions made after you retired\n- lump-sum payments from an HR-10 (Keogh) plan, but only if federal Form 4972 is not used. Do not include that part of your payment that was derived from contributions made after you retired\n- periodic distributions of benefits from a cafeteria plan [IRC section 125] or a qualified cash or deferred profit-sharing or stock bonus plan [IRC section 401(k)], but not distributions derived from contributions made after you retired\nQualifying pension and annuity income does not include:\n- Distributions you received as a nonemployee spouse in accordance with a court-issued qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) that meets the criteria of IRC section 414(p)(1)(A) or in accordance with a domestic relations order (DRO) issued by a New York court. For additional information, see Publication 36.\n- Distributions you received as a result of an annuity contract purchased with your own funds from an insurance company or other financial institution. The payments are attributable to premium payments you made using your own funds and are not attributable to personal services you performed. For additional information, see Publication 36.\nMarried taxpayers\nIf you both qualify, you and your spouse can each subtract up to $20,000 of your own pension and annuity income. However, neither of you can claim any unused part of your spouse’s exclusion.\nExample: Chris and Pat, both age 62, included total pension and annuity income of $45,000 in their federal adjusted gross income on their joint federal tax return. Chris received qualifying pension and annuity payments totaling $30,000 and Pat received qualifying payments totaling $15,000. They are filing a joint New York State resident personal income tax return. Chris may claim the maximum pension and annuity income exclusion of $20,000, and Pat may claim an exclusion of $15,000, for a total pension and annuity income exclusion of $35,000.\nBeneficiaries\nIf you received a decedent’s pension and annuity income, you may make this subtraction if the decedent would have been entitled to it, had the decedent continued to live, regardless of your age. If the decedent would have become 59½ during 2024, enter only the amount received after the decedent would have become 59½, but not more than $20,000.\nIf any portion of this exclusion was subtracted on the decedent’s personal income tax return, you must first reduce the amount you are eligible to claim by the same amount subtracted on the decedent’s return. The total pension and annuity income exclusion claimed by the decedent and the decedent’s beneficiaries cannot exceed $20,000.\nIf the decedent has more than one beneficiary, the decedent’s $20,000 pension and annuity income exclusion must be allocated among the beneficiaries. Each beneficiary’s share of the $20,000 exclusion is determined by multiplying $20,000 by a fraction whose numerator is the value of the pensions and annuities inherited by the beneficiary, and whose denominator is the total value inherited by all beneficiaries of the decedent’s pensions and annuities.\nExample: A taxpayer received pension and annuity income totaling $6,000 as a beneficiary of a decedent who was 59½ before January 1, 2024. The decedent’s total pension and annuity income was $24,000, shared equally among four beneficiaries. Each beneficiary is entitled to one-quarter of the decedent’s pension exclusion, or $5,000 ($20,000 multiplied by .25). The taxpayer also received a qualifying pension and annuity payment of $14,000 in 2024. The taxpayer is entitled to claim a pension and annuity income exclusion of $19,000 ($14,000 attributable to the taxpayer’s own pension and annuity payment, plus $5,000 received as a beneficiary*).\n* The total amount of the taxpayer’s pension and annuity income exclusion that can be applied against the taxpayer’s pension and annuity income received as a beneficiary is limited to the taxpayer’s share of the decedent’s pension and annuity income exclusion.\nDisability income exclusion\nIf you are also claiming the disability income exclusion (Form IT-225, S-124), the total of your pension and annuity income exclusion and disability income exclusion cannot exceed $20,000.\nNew York State amount column\nNonresidents\nIf you received pension or annuity income as a nonresident of New York State, and were required to report it in the New York State amount column on line 10 and it qualifies for the pension and annuity income exclusion (see above), enter that amount, but not more than $20,000, in the New York State amount column.\nHowever, if you allocated the amount included on line 10, in the New York State amount column because you performed services inside and outside New York State, then you must allocate the pension and annuity exclusion in the same manner, using the same allocation percentage (but not more than $20,000).\nPart-year residents\nYou may be entitled to deduct in the New York State amount column a pension and annuity income exclusion of up to $20,000 for each of your taxable periods.\nFor your period of residence, include that part of the qualifying pension and annuity income that you received during the period you were a resident, but not more than $20,000.\nFor the period you were not a New York State resident, include only that part of the qualifying pension and annuity income you received during the period you were a nonresident that was required to be included in the line 10, New York State amount column, but not more than $20,000. If you allocated the pension and annuity income that you received during your nonresident period to New York because it was attributable to services performed inside and outside New York State, you must allocate the pension and annuity income exclusion using the same allocation percentage applied to your pension and annuity income included on line 10 (but not more than $20,000).\nLine 29: Other subtractions\nUse this line to report other subtractions that are not specifically listed on Form IT-203.\nEnter on line 29, Federal amount column, the amount from Form IT-225, line 18.\nEnter on line 29, New York State amount column, the sum of the entries from Form IT-225, lines 10 and 14, column B. Submit Form IT-225 with your return.\nLine 31: New York adjusted gross income\nIn the amount boxes to the left of line 45, enter the amounts from line 31 in the Federal amount column and the New York State amount column. If the amount on line 31 in either the Federal amount column or the New York State amount column is zero or less, skip lines 32 through 44; enter 0 on line 45; and continue on line 47.\nDo not leave line 31 blank.\nStep 5: Enter your New York standard or New York itemized deduction and dependent exemption amounts\nLine 33: Standard or itemized deduction\nYou may take either the New York standard deduction or the New York itemized deduction.\nTo determine which deduction to use, follow these steps:\n- To find the standard deduction amount for your filing status, use the New York State standard deduction table below.\n- To calculate your New York itemized deduction, use Form IT-196, New York Resident, Nonresident, and Part-Year Resident Itemized Deductions, and its instructions.\n- Compare the Form IT-196, line 49 amount to your New York standard deduction amount from the standard deduction table.\n- For greater tax savings, enter the larger of these amounts on line 33 and mark an X in the appropriate box, Standard or Itemized.\nNotes:\n- If you choose the itemized deduction, you must submit Form IT-196 with your return.\n- If you are married and filing separate returns (filing status ③), both of you must take the standard deduction unless both of you choose to itemize deductions on your New York returns.\n- If you paid qualified college tuition expenses, your New York itemized deduction may be increased to an amount greater than your New York standard deduction.*\n*Complete Form IT-196 to determine if your allowable New York itemized deduction, including the college tuition itemized deduction, is greater than your standard deduction. See College tuition credit or itemized deduction or visit www.tax.ny.gov (search: college).\nLine 35: Dependent exemptions\nThe value of each New York State dependent exemption is $1,000.\nEnter on line 35 the number of your dependents listed on Form IT-203, item I (and on Form IT-203 - item I continued, if you are claiming more than 6 dependents).\nLines 36 and 37: Taxable income\nSubtract line 35 from line 34.

For example, if the amounts used were $12,000 divided by $36,000, the result would be .3333. Enter this decimal on line 45; do not convert to a percentage.\nIf the amount on line 31 in either the Federal amount column or New York State amount column is zero or less, enter 0 on line 45.\nIf the amount on line 31 in the New York State amount column is more than the amount on line 31 in the Federal amount column, the income percentage will be more than 100%. For example, if the amounts used were $25,000 divided by $15,000, the result would be 1.6667.\nIf you used Form IT-230, Part 2, you must complete the Nonresident and part-year resident income percentage schedule of Form IT-230-I, Instructions for Form IT-230, to calculate the income percentage to enter on line 45.\nLine 47: New York State nonrefundable credits\nIf you are claiming any nonrefundable credits, complete the appropriate credit forms and Form IT-203-ATT, Other Tax Credits and Taxes.

Review the instructions for Form IT-216 and, if you qualify, complete Form IT-216 and transfer the amount from Form IT-216 to Form IT-203, line 52. Submit Form IT-216 with your return.\n*For most taxpayers, federal adjusted gross income is the amount from Form IT-203, line 19, Federal amount column. However, if on Form IT-203 you entered special condition code A6 (for Build America Bond interest), your federal adjusted gross income (for line 52) is the line 19 amount minus any Build America Bond interest that was included in the line 19 amount.\nLines 52b through 52f: Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (MCTMT)\nThe metropolitan commuter transportation mobility tax (MCTMT) is imposed on self-employed individuals with net earnings from self-employment allocated to Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD).\nFor purposes of the MCTMT, the MCTD is divided into two zones.\n- Zone 1 includes the counties of:\n-\n- Bronx\n- Kings (Brooklyn)\n- New York (Manhattan)\n- Queens\n- Richmond (Staten Island)\n- Zone 2 includes the counties of:\n-\n- Dutchess\n- Nassau\n- Orange\n- Putnam\n- Rockland\n- Suffolk\n- Westchester\nIf an individual’s net earnings from self-employment allocated to either zone exceed $50,000 for the taxable year, then you are subject to the MCTMT. The $50,000 threshold is calculated on an individual basis, even if you file a joint income tax return.\nFor purposes of the MCTMT, self-employed individuals include:\n- Sole proprietors\n- Partners in partnerships\n- Members of limited liability companies (LLCs) that are treated as partnerships\n- Partners of limited liability partnerships (LLPs) that are treated as partnerships\nNote: Partners and members will be collectively referred to as partners. Partnerships, including LLPs and LLCs treated as partnerships, will be collectively referred to as partnerships in these instructions.\nDid you or your spouse have net earnings from self-employment allocated to Zone 1 or Zone 2 (or both) that exceed $50,000?\n- If No, skip lines 52b through 52f, and go to line 53.\n- If Yes, you are subject to MCTMT. Go to lines 52b and 52c as applicable.\nLines 52b and 52c: MCTMT net earnings base (see the detailed explanation below) for:\n- Zone 1- Enter the amount of net earnings from self-employment allocated to Zone 1 for the tax year on line 52b.\n- Zone 2- Enter the amount of net earnings from self-employment allocated to Zone 2 for the tax year on line 52c.\nNotes:\n- Only enter an amount on line 52b if your net earnings from self-employment allocated to Zone 1 exceed $50,000 for the tax year (calculated on an individual basis, even if you file a joint income tax return).\n- Only enter an amount on line 52c if your net earnings from self-employment allocated to Zone 2 exceed $50,000 for the tax year (calculated on an individual basis, even if you file a joint income tax return).\n- However, if you are an owner of an approved business or a partner in an approved business in the START-UP NY program, see START-UP NY below.\nYou must calculate your MCTMT net earnings base separately for each source of self-employment income that has business activity in one or both zones. If you have more than one source, combine all the individual amounts on line 52b (Zone 1 amounts) or line 52c (Zone 2 amounts), as applicable.\nTo calculate your MCTMT net earnings base you must multiply your net earnings from self-employment from each source by the specific zone’s allocation percentage for each source (see Determining the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District allocation percentage below).\nJoint returns\nIf you are filing a joint return, you and your spouse must each calculate the $50,000 Zone 1 threshold and the $50,000 Zone 2 threshold on an individual basis:\n- For the MCTMT net earnings base for Zone 1 reported on line 52b:\n-\n- If each spouse’s individually calculated MCTMT net earnings base in Zone 1 is more than $50,000, add the two amounts and enter the combined total on line 52b.\n- If either spouse’s individually calculated MCTMT net earnings base in Zone 1 is $50,000 or less, do not include that spouse’s base on line 52b.\n- For the MCTMT net earnings base for Zone 2 reported on line 52c:\n-\n- If each spouse’s individually calculated MCTMT net earnings base in Zone 2 is more than $50,000, add the two amounts and enter the combined total on line 52c.\n- If either spouse’s individually calculated MCTMT net earnings base in Zone 2 is $50,000 or less, do not include that spouse’s base on line 52c.\nExample: You are filing a joint return. You have net earnings from self-employment totaling $120,000 in the MCTD, of which, $75,000 is allocated to Zone 1, and $45,000 is allocated to Zone 2. Your spouse also has net earnings from self-employment totaling $105,000, of which, $51,000 is allocated to Zone 1, and $54,000 is allocated to Zone 2.\nSince each spouse’s individually calculated net earnings from self-employment allocated to Zone 1 exceed the $50,000 threshold, you must add the two amounts together ($75,000 + $51,000) and enter the total of $126,000 on line 52b.\nSince your net earnings from self-employment allocated to Zone 2 is less than the $50,000 threshold, do not include your net earnings in the total on line 52c. However, you must enter your spouse’s net earnings from self-employment allocated to Zone 2 of $54,000 on line 52c.\nMCTD allocation percentage\nDetermining the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District allocation percentage for each source of self-employment income:\n- START-UP NY approved business owners or partners of an approved business who have net earnings from self-employment allocated to either zone of the MCTD, must complete Form IT-6-SNY, Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (MCTMT) for START-UP NY. If you have other sources of self-employment income allocated to either zone of the MCTD (other than the START-UP NY income), calculate those amounts as shown below. You must include all your net earnings from self-employment allocated to:\n-\n- Zone 1 on Form IT-6-SNY, line 1.\n- Zone 2 on Form IT-6-SNY, line 6.\nNote: You must enter the amounts from Form IT-6-SNY, line 5 or 10 on Form IT-203, line 52b or 52c, as applicable. It is possible that the amounts on Form IT-203, line 52b or 52c may be $50,000 or less.\nExample: Mary has total net earnings from self-employment within Zone 1 of $80,000. Since this amount exceeds the $50,000 threshold, Mary is subject to the MCTMT. However, because $45,000 is from the tax-free NY area within Zone 1, Mary will be able to exclude $45,000 from the net earnings base on which Mary will calculate the MCTMT. Therefore, Mary’s net earnings used to calculate the MCTMT is $35,000. Mary calculated the MCTMT net earnings base as follows:\n|\nNet earnings subject to MCTMT in Zone 1 reported on Form IT-6-SNY, line 1 |\n= $80,000 |\n|\nSTART-UP NY net earnings in the tax-free area in Zone 1 reported on Form IT-6-SNY, line 4 |\n= $45,000 |\n|\nMCTMT net earnings base for Zone 1 reported on Form IT-6-SNY, line 5 and Form IT-203, line 52b |\n= $35,000 |\n- Partners must allocate partnership income to each zone of the MCTD based on the partnership's allocation. Partners will receive their Zone 1 or Zone 2 (or both) allocation percentage from their partnership on Form IT-204-IP, New York Partner's Schedule K-1.\n- Zone 1- Multiply your net partnership income by the Zone 1 allocation percentage from Form IT-204-IP, line 29b, to determine the amount to include on line 52b.\n- Zone 2- Multiply your net partnership income by the Zone 2 allocation percentage from Form IT-204-IP, line 29c, to determine the amount to include on line 52c.\nIf you are a partner in more than one partnership, calculate the amount separately for each partnership.\nExample: Pat is a partner in a partnership XYZ doing business in Zone 1. Pat also reports net earnings from self-employment from two businesses that report their activity on federal Schedule C (Form 1040). Business A carries on business both in and out of Zone 1. Business B carries on business only inside Zone 1. Pat calculates the amount to enter on Line 52b as follows:\n|\n1. Net partnership income of $80,000 multiplied by 65% (.65), the Zone 1 allocation percentage shown on Form IT-204-IP, line 29b |\n= $52,000 |\n|\n2. Business B's net earnings from self-employment of $36,000 |\n= $36,000 |\n|\n3. Business A's net earnings from self-employment of $30,000. Since the business is carried on both in and out of Zone 1, use Form IT-203-A to calculate the amount to include: Net earnings of $30,000 × 40% (Form IT-203-A, line 8) |\n= $12,000 |\n|\nTotal amount to be included on line 52b |\n= $100,000 |\n- All others:\n- Zone 1 –\n- If all your net earnings from self-employment are from business activity carried on inside Zone 1, then all your net earnings from self-employment are allocated to Zone 1. Include the total net earnings from self-employment for that source on line 52b.\n- If your net earnings from self-employment are from business activity both inside and outside Zone 1, you must complete Form IT-203-A, Business Allocation Schedule, to calculate the amount to include on line 52b.\n- Zone 2 –\n- If all your net earnings from self-employment are from business activity carried on inside Zone 2, then all your net earnings from self-employment are allocated to Zone 2. Include the total net earnings from self-employment for that source on line 52c.\n- If your net earnings from self-employment are from business activity both inside and outside Zone 2, you must complete Form IT-203-A, Business Allocation Schedule, to calculate the amount to include on line 52c.\n- Zone 1 –\nNote: For the definition of business activity inside and outside either zone of the MCTD, see Form IT-203-A-I, Instructions for Form IT-203-A.\nNet earnings from self-employment generally is the amount reported on federal Schedule SE (Form 1040), Part 1, line 6, derived from the source of self-employment income.\nUnder IRC section 1402, income from certain employment is treated as income from a trade or business, and is reported on federal Schedule SE (Form 1040) as net earnings from self-employment. Accordingly, the income is included in an individual's calculation of net earnings from self-employment allocated to the MCTD and is subject to the MCTMT.\nTypes of employment treated as a trade or business under IRC section 1402 include but are not limited to:\n- services performed by a United States citizen employed by a foreign government, the United Nations, or other international organization;\n- services performed by a church employee if the church or other qualified church-controlled organization has a certificate in effect electing an exemption from employer Social Security and Medicare taxes; and\n- qualified services performed by a minister, a member of a religious order who has not taken a vow of poverty, or a Christian Science practitioner or reader.\nIf your net earnings from self-employment are not subject to federal self-employment tax (for example, nonresident noncitizens), use federal Schedule SE (Form 1040) to calculate your net earnings from self-employment as if they were subject to the tax.\nNote: In determining if the exclusion under IRC § 1402(a)(13) applies, an individual shall not be considered a limited partner if they directly, or indirectly, take part in the control, or participate in the management or operations of the partnership such that they are not a passive investor, regardless of their title or characterization in a partnership or operating agreement. In this case, you must include the distributive share from such partnership in your net earnings from self-employment [Tax Law § 800(e)].\nLine 52d: MCTMT for Zone 1\nMultiply the amount on line 52b by .60% (.0060).\nLine 52e: MCTMT for Zone 2\nMultiply the amount on line 52c by .34% (.0034).\nExample: You have net earnings from self-employment totaling $110,000 in the MCTD with $40,000 allocated to Zone 1, and $70,000 allocated to Zone 2. The amount allocated to Zone 1, $40,000, is exempt from the MCTMT since it is less than the $50,000 threshold. However, the amount allocated to Zone 2, $70,000, exceeds the $50,000 threshold. Therefore, you calculate your MCTMT as follows:\n-\n- $70,000 (amount allocated to Zone 2) x .0034 (Zone 2 rate) = $238 (amount entered on line 52e)\nExample: You have net earnings from self-employment totaling $110,000 in the MCTD with $53,000 allocated to Zone 1, and $57,000 allocated to Zone 2. The net earnings allocated to both zones exceed the $50,000 threshold. Therefore, you calculate your MCTMT as follows:\n-\n- $53,000 (amount allocated to Zone 1) x .0060 (Zone 1 rate) = $318 (amount entered on line 52d)\n- $57,000 (amount allocated to Zone 2) x .0034 (Zone 2 rate) = $194 (amount entered on line 52e)\n- $318 + $194 = $512 (amount entered on line 52f)\nLine 53: Yonkers nonresident earnings tax\nDid you earn wages or conduct a trade or business in Yonkers either as an individual or as a member of a partnership?\n- If No, go to line 54.\n- If Yes, complete Form Y-203, Yonkers Nonresident Earnings Tax Return. Enter the amount of tax on line 53 and submit Form Y-203 with your return.\nLine 54: Part-year Yonkers resident income tax surcharge\nIf you were a resident of Yonkers for only part of 2024, complete Form IT-360.1, Change of City Resident Status. Enter the tax amount on line 54 and submit Form IT-360.1 with your return.\nLine 56: Sales or use tax\nReport your sales or use tax liability on this line.\nYou owe sales or compensating use tax if you:\n- purchased an item or service subject to tax that is delivered to you in New York State without payment of New York State and local tax to the seller; or\n- purchased an item or service outside New York State that is subject to tax in New York State (and you were a resident of New York State at the time of purchase) with subsequent use in New York State.\nNote: You may be entitled to a credit for sales tax paid to another state. See the exact calculation method in the instructions, for Form ST-141, Individual Purchaser’s Periodic Report of Sales and Use Tax.\nFor sales and use tax purposes, a resident includes persons who have a permanent place of abode in the state. Accordingly, you may be a resident for sales tax purposes even though you may not be a resident for income tax purposes. For more information, see the instructions for Form ST-141.\nYou may not use this line to report:\n- any sales and use tax on business purchases if the business is registered for sales and use tax purposes. You must report this tax on the business’s sales tax return.\n- any unpaid sales and use tax on motor vehicles, trailers, all-terrain vehicles, vessels, or snowmobiles. This tax is paid directly to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). If you will not be registering or titling it at the DMV, you should remit the tax directly to the Tax Department using Form ST-130, Business Purchaser’s Report of Sales and Use Tax, or Form ST-141.\nAn unpaid sales or use tax liability commonly arises if you made purchases through the Internet, by catalog, from television shopping channels, or on an Indian reservation (except for purchases subject to Oneida Nation taxes), or if you purchased items or services subject to tax in another state and brought them back to New York for use here.\nExample 1: You purchased a computer over the Internet that was delivered to your house in Monroe County, New York, from an out-of-state company and did not pay sales tax to that company.\nExample 2: You purchased a book on a trip to New Hampshire that you brought back to your residence in Nassau County, New York, for use there.\nYou may also owe an additional local tax if you use property or services in another locality in New York State, other than the locality to which you paid tax.

If you marked Yes, you are not eligible for any tax credit allowed under Tax Law Article 9, 9-A, or 33, or any business tax credits allowed under Tax Law Article 22.

Enter the amount and code 052 on a line between lines 7a-7n.\nLines 10 and 11\nIf you wrote EIC in the box to the left of line 43 on Form IT-203 because you are having the IRS calculate your earned income credit, write EIC in the box(es) (not in the money column[s]) to the left of line(s) 10 or 11; leave the money column(s) blank.\nInstructions for Form IT-203-B, Nonresident and Part-Year Resident Income Allocation and College Tuition Itemized Deduction Worksheet\nSchedule A – Allocation of wage and salary income to New York State\nIf any amount included on line 1 of Form IT-203 in the Federal amount column represents wage and salary income earned from work within New York State and outside of New York State while a nonresident, and that income does not depend directly on the volume of the business transacted (for example, hourly wages), you must complete Schedule A to calculate the amount earned in New York State. For each job where such wages or salaries were earned both inside New York State and outside New York State, you must complete a separate Schedule A.\nIf you were married and both you and your spouse worked in New York State and earned wages subject to allocation, each of you must complete a separate Schedule A for each job with allocable wages.\nWork days are days on which you were required to perform the usual duties of your job. Any allowance for days worked outside New York State must be based upon the performance of services which, because of necessity (not convenience) of the employer, obligate the employee to out-of-state duties in the service of their employer. Such duties are those which, by their very nature cannot be performed at the employer’s place of business.\nApplying the above principles, normal work days spent at home are considered days worked in New York State, and days spent working at home that are not normal work days are considered to be nonworking days. Under this rule, days worked at home are considered New York work days only if the employee’s assigned or primary work location is at an established office or other bona fide place of business of the employer (a bona fide employer office) in New York State. If the employee’s assigned or primary work location is at an established office or other bona fide place of business of the employer outside New York State, then any normal work day worked at home would be treated as a day worked outside New York State.\nIf an employee’s assigned or primary office is in New York State, any normal work day spent at the home office will be treated as a day worked outside the state if the employee’s home office is a bona fide employer office. Any day spent at the home office that is not a normal work day would be considered a nonworking day. For more information on a bona fide employer office, see TSB-M-06(5)I, New York Tax Treatment of Nonresidents and Part-Year Residents Application of the Convenience of the Employer Test to Telecommuters and Others. This TSB-M is available on the Tax Department’s website [search: TSB-M-06(5)I].\nLine instructions\nLine 1a\nEnter the total number of days you were employed at this job during the year while you were a nonresident. If you were employed at the same job from January 1 through December 31, you would enter 365 (except in leap years). If the period of employment is less than a full year, enter the actual period of employment. If you were employed in and out of New York State for separate periods of 170 days by one employer and 195 days by another employer, you would enter 170 on the first Schedule A, line 1a, and enter 195 on the second Schedule A, line 2a.\nLine 1b\nEnter the total number of Saturdays and Sundays not worked during this period of employment.\nLine 1c\nEnter the total number of holidays (such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, or Columbus Day) not worked during this period of employment.\nLine 1d\nEnter the total number of days you did not work because of sickness during this period of employment.\nLine 1e\nEnter the total number of days you did not work because you were on vacation during this period of employment.\nLine 1f\nEnter the total number of days you did not work for other reasons during this period of employment.\nLine 1o\nEnter the amount of wages, salaries, tips, etc. earned during the nonresident period. If you changed your residence into or out of New York State during the year, do not include any income earned during the resident period in this amount.\nLine 1p\nIf you have to allocate wages or salaries received from more than one job, total the line p amounts from all Schedule A sections and include the total on Form IT-203, line 1, in the New York State amount column.\nIf you are married filing jointly, include the combined amounts of wages allocated to New York from the separate Schedule A sections completed by you and your spouse on Form IT-203, line 1, in the New York State amount column.\nFailure to complete Schedule A and submit it with your Form IT-203 will result in a delay in the processing of your return.\nSchedule B – Living quarters maintained in New York State\nComplete this schedule if you marked the Yes box at item H on Form IT-203. If you or your spouse had living quarters available for your use in New York State during any part of 2024, (whether or not you personally used those living quarters for any part of the year) enter the address(es).\nLiving quarters include a house, apartment, co‑op or any other dwelling that is suitable for year-round use, that you or your spouse maintain or pay for, or that is maintained for your primary use by another person, family member, or employer.\nExample: Company A leases an apartment in New York State for the use of one of the company’s officers, and the apartment is mainly available to that individual. That individual is considered to be maintaining living quarters in New York State even though others might use the apartment on an occasional basis.\nEnter the number of days you were in New York State, even if on personal business. (Married filing jointly? If both spouses spent days in New York State, enter the higher number of days.) Do not count days you traveled through New York State to use a common carrier such as an airplane, train, or bus.\nNote: If you marked the Yes box at item H, and you spent 184 days or more (any part of a day is a day for this purpose) in New York State, you may be considered a resident for New York State income tax purposes. The determination of residency is based on the facts and circumstances of your own situation. See the definition of Resident, Nonresident, and Part-year resident in these instructions.\nIn addition, if you marked the Yes box at item H and the living quarters were located in New York City or Yonkers, you may also be considered a resident of New York City or Yonkers for income tax filing purposes.\nIf you meet the definition of a resident of New York State, New York City, or Yonkers, you may not file Form IT‑203. You must file Form IT‑201, Resident Income Tax Return.\nSchedule C – College tuition itemized deduction worksheet\nIf you, your spouse, or your dependent(s) were a student enrolled at or attending an institution of higher education, you may be entitled to a college tuition itemized deduction. The maximum deduction allowed is $10,000 per eligible student. You must complete Schedule C and submit Form IT-203-B with your return if you are claiming the college tuition itemized deduction.\nNote: If a student is claimed as a dependent on another person’s New York State tax return, only the person who claims the student as a dependent may claim the itemized deduction. If a student is not claimed as a dependent on another person’s New York State tax return, only the student may claim the itemized deduction.\nEligible student includes the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s spouse, and the taxpayer’s dependent (for whom an exemption for New York State income tax purposes is allowed).\nAn institution of higher education means any institution of higher education or business, trade, technical, or other occupational school, located in or out of New York State. The institution must be recognized and approved by either the regents of the University of New York or a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association accepted by the regents. In addition, the institution or school must provide a course of study leading to the granting of a post-secondary degree, certificate, or diploma.\nWhere referenced on Schedule C and in these instructions, the term college or university includes all the above institutions.\nQualified college tuition expenses include tuition required for the enrollment or attendance of the eligible student at an institution of higher education. The expenses may be paid by cash, check, credit card, or with borrowed funds. The eligible student does not need to be enrolled in a degree program or attend full time for the expenses to qualify. However, only expenses for undergraduate enrollment or attendance qualify. Expenses for enrollment or attendance at elementary or secondary public, private, or religious schools, or in a course of study leading to the granting of a post-baccalaureate or other graduate degree do not qualify.\nPayments on behalf of an eligible student from a qualified state tuition program (such as New York’s 529 college savings program) are considered qualified tuition expenses for purposes of the college tuition deduction. If you claim the student as a dependent, these payments are treated as paid by you.\nGenerally, qualified tuition expenses paid on behalf of an eligible student by someone other than the student (such as a relative) are treated as paid by the student. However, if the eligible student is claimed as a dependent on another person’s New York State income tax return, only the person who claims the student as a dependent for income tax purposes may claim the deduction for college tuition expenses that were paid (or treated as paid) by the student. This is the case even if the expenses were paid from the student’s earnings, gifts, inheritances, or savings.\nIf you or the eligible student claims a federal deduction or credit for qualified college tuition expenses, you can still use these expenses to calculate the college tuition itemized deduction.\nQualified tuition expenses do not include:\n- tuition paid through the receipt of scholarships or financial aid (for this purpose, financial aid does not mean student loans, other loans and grants that must be repaid either before or after the student ceases attending school);\n- amounts paid for room and board, insurance, medical expenses (including student health fees), transportation, or other similar personal, living, or family expenses; or\n- fees for course-related books, supplies, equipment, and nonacademic activities, even if the fees are required to be paid to the institution as a condition of enrollment or attendance.\nSpecial rules\nLimitation\nThe maximum amount of qualified college tuition expenses allowed for each eligible student is $10,000. However, there is no limit on the number of eligible students for whom you may claim the itemized deduction.\nSpouses filing separately\nIf you and your spouse are filing separate returns, you may each claim your separately calculated college tuition itemized deduction. However, you must each claim your separately calculated itemized deduction based only upon the amount of qualified college tuition expenses you paid (or that were treated as if paid by you) for yourself, your spouse, or a person who you claim as a dependent on your separate return. You cannot claim expenses for a dependent claimed by your spouse.\nLine A\nEnter the first and last name of the eligible student. List each eligible student only once on line A. If you are claiming the college tuition itemized deduction for more than three students, submit a separate statement with your Form IT-203-B. Write your name and Social Security number on the statement.\nLine D\nIf the eligible student is someone other than you or your spouse, the student must be claimed as a dependent on your New York State return. If the eligible student is you or your spouse, mark an X in the No box.\nLines E and F\nEnter the EIN and name of the college or university to which qualified college tuition expenses were paid. Obtain the EIN from Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement, or contact the college or university.\nIf the eligible student attended more than one college or university during the tax year, enter the EIN and name of the last one attended.\nLine G\nIf No, stop; these tuition expenses do not qualify for the deduction. Only expenses for undergraduate enrollment or attendance qualify.\nLine H\nEnter only qualified college tuition expenses paid for the eligible student in 2024.\nIf you paid qualified college tuition expenses in 2024 for an academic period that begins in 2025 or after, those expenses are considered eligible expenses for the 2024 college tuition itemized deduction.\nExpenses reimbursed to you from your employer are not eligible for the college tuition itemized deduction. When figuring your itemized deduction, you must reduce the total of your qualified college tuition expenses by any scholarships or financial aid received or by any refunds of qualified expenses. If you have not received a refund, scholarship, or other form of financial aid before you file your tax return, reduce your qualified expenses by the amount that will be received if you can determine this amount. If the refund, scholarship, or financial aid is received after you have filed your return, you must file Form IT‑203‑X, Amended Nonresident and Part‑Year Resident Income Tax Return. Calculate the amount by which your deduction would have been reduced if the refund, scholarship, or financial aid had been received in the year for which you claimed the deduction.\nLine I\nEnter for each student listed on line A the lesser of $10,000 or the amount of qualified college tuition expenses shown on line H.\nIf you paid qualified college tuition expenses to more than one college or university for the same eligible student, enter the total qualified expenses paid to all institutions during 2024 for that student on one line.\nAdditional information\nDefinitions used to determine resident, nonresident, or part-year resident\nYou may have to pay income tax as a New York State resident even if you are not considered a resident for other purposes. For income tax purposes, your resident status depends on where you were domiciled and where you maintained a permanent place of abode during the taxable year. See Income tax definitions or visit www.tax.ny.gov (search: definitions) to determine your residency for income tax purposes. See also:\nDomicile\nIn general, your domicile is the place you intend to have as your permanent home. Your domicile is, in effect, where your permanent home is located. It is the place you intend to return to after being away (as on vacation abroad, business assignment, educational leave, or military assignment).\nYou can have only one domicile. Your New York domicile does not change until you can demonstrate that you have abandoned your New York domicile and established a new permanent domicile outside New York State.\nA change of domicile must be clear and convincing. Easily controlled factors such as where you vote, where your driver’s license and registration are issued, or where your will is located are not primary factors in establishing domicile. To determine whether you have, in fact, changed your domicile, you should compare:\n- the size, value, and nature of use of your first residence to the size, value, and nature of use of your newly acquired residence;\n- your employment or business connections or both in both locations;\n- the amount of time spent in both locations;\n- the physical location of items that have significant sentimental value to you in both locations; and\n- your close family ties in both locations. A change of domicile is clear and convincing only when your primary ties are clearly greater in the new location. When weighing your primary ties, keep in mind that some may weigh more heavily than others, depending upon your overall lifestyle. If required by the Tax Department, it is the taxpayer’s responsibility to produce documentation showing the necessary intention to effect a change of domicile.\nA change of domicile is clear and convincing only when your primary ties are clearly greater in the new location. When weighing your primary ties, keep in mind that some may weigh more heavily than others, depending upon your overall lifestyle. If required by the Tax Department, it is the taxpayer’s responsibility to produce documentation showing the necessary intention to effect a change of domicile.\nIf you move to a new location but intend to stay there only for a limited amount of time (no matter how long), your domicile does not change.\nExample: An employee of ABC Electronics in Newburgh, New York, was temporarily assigned to the Atlanta, Georgia branch office for two years. After the employee's stay in Atlanta, they returned to their job in New York. The employee's domicile did not change during their stay in Georgia; it remained New York State.\nIf your domicile is in New York State and you go to a foreign country because of a business assignment by your employer, or for study, research or any other purpose, your domicile does not change unless you show that you definitely do not intend to return to New York.\nPermanent place of abode\nIn general, a permanent place of abode is a residence (a building or structure where a person can live) that you permanently maintain, whether you own it or not, that is suitable for year-round use. A permanent place of abode usually includes a residence your spouse owns or leases.\nHowever, a residence maintained by a full-time student enrolled at an institution of higher education in an undergraduate degree program leading to a baccalaureate degree and occupied by the student while attending the institution is not a permanent place of abode with respect to that student. For additional information, see TSB-M-09(15)I, Amendment to the Definition of Permanent Place of Abode in the Personal Income Tax Regulations Relating to Certain Undergraduate Students.\nNote: Special rules under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act apply to members of the military and their spouses for determining residency.

However, even if your domicile is New York, you are not a resident if you meet all three of the conditions in either Group A or Group B as follows:\n- Group A\n- You did not maintain any permanent place of abode in New York State during the taxable year; and\n- You maintained a permanent place of abode outside New York State during the entire taxable year; and\n- You spent 30 days or less (a part of a day is a day for this purpose) in New York State during the taxable year.\n- Group B\n- You were in a foreign country for at least 450 days (a part of a day is a day for this purpose) during any period of 548 consecutive days; and\n- You, your spouse (unless legally separated) and minor children spent 90 days or less (a part of a day is a day for this purpose) in New York State during this 548-day period; and\n- During the nonresident portion of the taxable year in which the 548-day period begins, and during the nonresident portion of the taxable year in which the 548-day period ends, you were present in New York State for no more than the number of days which bears the same ratio to 90 as the number of days in such portion of the taxable year bears to 548. The following formula illustrates this condition:\n- Group A\n| Number of days in the nonresident portion 548 |\nx | 90 | = | Maximum number of days allowed in New York State |\nNonresident\nYou are a New York State nonresident if you were not a resident of New York State for any part of the year.\nPart-year resident\nYou are a New York State part-year resident if you meet the definition of resident or nonresident for only part of the year.\nNew York City and Yonkers\nFor the definition of a New York City or Yonkers resident, nonresident, and part-year resident, see the definitions of a New York State resident, nonresident, and part-year resident above, and substitute New York City or Yonkers in place of New York State.\nSpecial accruals for full-year nonresidents\nYou are subject to the special accrual rules only if you have accrued income for 2024 and\n- you were a resident of New York State on December 31, 2023; or\n- you will be a New York State resident on January 1, 2025.\nYou have accrued income for 2024 if you have an item of:\n- income that was fixed and determinable in a tax year prior to 2024, but you are reporting that income for federal income tax purposes in tax year 2024; or\n- non-New York source income* that was fixed and determinable in tax year 2024, but you will be reporting that income for federal income tax purposes in a tax year after 2024.\n*Non-New York source income is income that is not attributable to:\n- a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on in New York State, or\n- the ownership of any interest in real or tangible personal property in New York State.\nIf you are subject to the special accrual rules, see the instructions for Form IT-225, addition modification number A-115 and subtraction modification number S-129.\nSpecial accruals for part-year residents\nIncome accrues to you as a taxpayer when the amount of income becomes fixed and determinable and you have an unrestricted right to receive it.\nAn accrued expense is a cost that has been incurred but not yet paid.\nIf you are an individual moving out of New York State, accrued income is income you earned during your New York State resident period but did not receive until after you became a nonresident of New York State.\nIf you moved out of New York State, you must accrue any item of income, gain, loss, or deduction that, under an accrual method of accounting, would be reportable at the time you changed your residence. This includes income or gain you elected to report on the installment basis. You must also include the total taxable amount of lump-sum distributions subject to the separate tax on lump-sum distributions (Form IT-230).\nIf you are an individual moving into New York State, accrued income is income you earned from a non-New York State source during your nonresident period but received after you became a New York State resident.\nIf you became a resident of New York State during the tax year, you must accrue any item of income, gain, loss, or deduction that, under an accrual method of accounting, would be reportable at the time you changed your residence. However, no accrual is required or allowed for items of income, gain, loss, or deduction derived from or connected with New York State sources.\nFor any subsequent tax year, any item of income, gain, loss, or deduction accrued up to the time you changed your residence must be excluded in determining your New York source income, New York adjusted gross income, or total taxable amount of lump-sum distributions.\nIf you are subject to the special accrual rules, see the instructions for Form IT-225, addition modification number A-115 and subtraction modification number S-129.\nEstates and trusts\nEstates and trusts are subject to New York State personal income tax. The fiduciary for an estate or trust must file Form IT-205, Fiduciary Income Tax Return. If you are a nonresident or part-year resident beneficiary of an estate or trust, you must include your share of the estate or trust income, if any portion of that income is derived from or connected with New York sources, on your Form IT-203. For more information on responsibilities of beneficiaries, see Beneficiaries (estates and trusts).\nDeceased taxpayers\nIf a taxpayer died after 2023 and before filing a return for 2024, the taxpayer’s spouse or personal representative may have to file and sign a return for that taxpayer. A personal representative can be an executor, administrator or anyone who is in charge of the deceased taxpayer’s property.\nIf a deceased taxpayer did not have to file a federal return but had New York State tax withheld, their spouse or personal representative must file a New York State income tax return to request a refund. Write the deceased taxpayer’s date of death in the area indicated near the top of the return.\nJoint returns\nIf you filed a joint federal income tax return for yourself and your deceased spouse, you may also file a joint New York State return on Form IT-203:\n- Write Filing as surviving spouse in the area where you sign the return.\n- Write the deceased taxpayer’s date of death in the area indicated near the top of the return.\n- If you are the personal representative for the deceased taxpayer, you must also sign the joint return.\nPartnerships/limited liability partnerships or companies\nPartnerships, limited liability partnerships (LLPs) and limited liability companies (LLCs), limited liability investment companies (LLICs) and limited liability trust companies (LLTCs) that are treated as partnerships for federal purposes are not subject to New York State personal income tax, but individual partners (members) of the partnerships are.\nIf your partnership has a partner who is a New York State resident, or if the partnership has any income from New York State sources, it must file Form IT-204, Partnership Return. If your partnership carried on a business in New York City, it may also have to file New York City’s Form NYC-204, Unincorporated Business Tax Return for Partnerships (including Limited Liability Companies). Since New York State does not administer the New York City unincorporated business tax, do not file your Form NYC-204 with your state return.\nNet operating loss (NOL)\nNonresident\nThe New York State net operating loss (NOL) to be included in the New York State amount column of a nonresident’s Form IT‑203 must be calculated in the same manner as the corresponding federal deduction, but using only New York State items of income, gain, loss, and deduction in the calculation.\nNew York State modifications (Form IT-203 lines 20 through 22 and 24 through 29) are not included in the calculation of the NOL or in determining the amount of loss to be used in the carryback or carryover year.\nIt is possible, because of the above rules, for a nonresident to have a New York State NOL without having a federal NOL, or to have a New York State NOL that is larger or smaller than the corresponding federal NOL. A nonresident individual claiming an NOL for New York State purposes but not for federal income tax purposes must file Form IT-203.\nPart-year resident\nA part‑year resident of New York State who incurs losses in the resident or nonresident period, or both, must make a separate NOL calculation for each period (resident and nonresident), using only those items of income, gain, loss, or deduction attributable to each period. For the resident period, calculate the NOL using only those items of income, gain, loss, and deduction that would have been reported if a separate federal return was filed for the period of New York State residence. For the nonresident period, calculate the NOL using the above rules for nonresidents.\nTo report an NOL on Form IT‑203, see the instructions for line 16, Other income, and addition modification number A-215 in the instructions for Form IT-225.\nFile Form IT‑203‑X to claim a personal income tax refund based upon an NOL carryback. File Form IT-201-X to claim a refund based upon a federal NOL carryback to a tax year when you were a full-year New York State resident. For more information on claiming a personal income tax refund based upon an NOL, see the instructions for Form IT-203-X or the instructions for Form IT-201-X.\nInnocent spouse relief\nThere are three types of innocent spouse relief:\n- innocent spouse\n- separation of liability\n- equitable relief\nInnocent spouse\nYou may qualify for relief from full or partial tax liability on a joint return as an innocent spouse if:\n- there is an understatement of tax on a joint return because of an omission or error involving income, deduction, credit, or basis;\n- you can show that when you signed the return you did not know and had no reason to know of the understatement; and\n- taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understated tax.\nSeparation of liability\nIf you and your spouse or former spouse are no longer married, or are legally separated, or have lived apart at all times during the 12-month period prior to the date of filing for relief, you may also request a separation of liability for any understated tax on a joint return.\nEquitable relief\nIf you do not qualify as an innocent spouse or for separation of liability, you may qualify for equitable relief if you can show that, considering all the facts and circumstances, you should not be held liable for any understatement or underpayment of tax.\nFor more information, see Form IT-285, Request for Innocent Spouse Relief (and Separation of Liability and Equitable Relief). You may use Form IT-285 only for innocent spouse relief under the three circumstances stated above. Do not file Form IT-285 with your return.\nIf you want to disclaim your spouse’s defaulted governmental education, state university, or city university loan or past-due support or past-due legally enforceable debt owed to a New York State agency or a New York City tax warrant judgment debt because you do not want to apply your part of a joint refund or refundable credit to a debt owed solely by your spouse, use Form IT-280, Nonobligated Spouse Allocation. You must complete Form IT-280 and submit it with your original return when filed. See Nonobligated spouse (Disclaiming your spouse’s debt).\nMembers of the armed forces\nIf you are a New York State nonresident, your military pay is not subject to New York State tax and cannot be used to determine the amount of New York State personal income tax you must pay (see the instructions for Form IT-225, subtraction modification number S-119). However, although a nonresident military spouse’s income is generally not considered to be New York source income (see Nonresidents – New York source income), the military spouse’s income is used to determine the amount of New York State personal income tax you must pay (the income is included in the Federal amount column). Any other income that you receive from New York State sources while you are a nonresident may be subject to tax. If you have a civilian job in New York State during your off‑duty hours, the income you receive is subject to income tax. Income or gain from property located in New York State, or from a business, trade, or profession carried on in this state is also subject to tax.\nIn addition, if you are a part-year New York State resident, certain combat pay that you received during your resident period may not be subject to tax (see the instructions for Form IT-225, subtraction modification number S-118).\nFor more information, visit www.tax.ny.gov (search: military).\nExclusion of, or deduction from, foreign earned income\nIf you are entitled to claim a federal exclusion of, or deduction from, your foreign earned income (as stated under IRC § 911), you are also allowed to claim it on your New York State income tax return in the Federal amount column. You would also be allowed to claim that portion of the federal exclusion of, or deduction from, foreign earned income in the New York State amount column to the extent it relates to income reported in the New York State amount column. If you claim either the exclusion or the deduction, submit a copy of your federal Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income, with your New York State income tax return.\nIf you have not yet qualified for the exclusion or deduction but you have filed a federal return, you must also file a New York State return. You should report all income, including income earned in any foreign country, reported on your federal return. If you later qualify for an exclusion or deduction, you can file an amended return on Form IT‑203‑X, Amended Nonresident and Part‑Year Resident Income Tax Return (see Other forms you may have to file). Submit a copy of federal Form 2555 with your Form IT‑203‑X.\nU.S. nonresident noncitizens\nIf you are a U.S. nonresident noncitizen for federal income tax purposes and are required to file federal Form 1040NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return, you may be required to file a New York State resident return, Form IT-201 or a New York State nonresident return, Form IT‑203. See Resident and New York State nonresidents and part‑year residents.\nIf you must file a New York return and you checked the married filing status on federal Form 1040NR, you must calculate your New York State tax as married filing separately and mark an X in box 3 at item A on your Form IT-201 or Form IT‑203. It is important to note that some income items and line references used on Form IT-201 or Form IT‑203 do not correspond with those shown on federal Form 1040NR. If there is no corresponding line on the New York State return, report this income as other income on line 16 of Form IT-201 or Form IT‑203.\nAlso, if you filed federal Form 1040NR you should claim the New York deduction (itemized or standard) that is more advantageous to you.\nStock options\nIf, as a New York State nonresident or part-year resident, you received stock options and the options you received are attributable to services performed in New York State, some or all of the federal income related to the options may be included in New York source income.\nTo determine the amount of federal income related to the options that must be included in New York source income, you should maintain records and documentation of your services performed in New York State. For additional information, see Form IT-203-F and its instructions.\nKeep a copy of your tax records\nRemember to keep a copy of your completed income tax return. Retain copies of your return for at least seven years after you file your return. We may also ask you to refer to a previously filed tax return for verification purposes if you:\n- call us for information about your return,\n- create an Online Services account,\n- check your refund status, or\n- view your 1099-G information.\nAlso keep copies of any books, records, schedules, statements, or other related documents. The Tax Department may ask you to provide copies of these records after you have filed your income tax returns.\nAmending your return\nThe deadline or due date to amend your return depends on the reason you are amending.\n- If you want to claim credit for, or a refund of, an overpayment, you must file an amended return within three years of the date that you filed the original return, or within two years of the date that you paid the tax, whichever is later.\n- If you file an amended federal return, you must also file an amended New York State return within 90 days from the date you file your amended federal return.\n- If the IRS makes changes to your federal return, you must report those changes to the New York State Tax Department within 90 days from the date the IRS makes its final determination.\nYou must also file an amended return to:\n- correct any error on your original state return,\n- file a protective claim, or\n- report an NOL carryback.\nWhat form to use\nUse Form IT-203-X if your original return was Form IT-203. Also use Form IT-203-X if you mistakenly filed Form IT-201, but you were a nonresident or part-year resident. Use Form IT-201-X if you mistakenly filed Form IT-203, but you were a full-year resident.\nPaid preparer information\nFor information relating to the Tax Preparer Registration Program, the signing of returns by a paid preparer (anyone you pay to prepare your return), e-file mandate for paid preparers, and other requirements relating to paid preparers, see Publication 58, Information for Income Tax Return Preparers, and Tips for hiring a tax preparer or visit www.tax.ny.gov (search: tips).\nHow to calculate your 2024 New York State tax\nTo calculate your 2024 New York State tax, use the table below to determine the correct method.\n| If your: | and your: | then use the: |\n|---|---|---|\n| NYS adjusted gross income is $107,650 or less (line 32) |\nAND NYS taxable income is less than $65,000 (line 37) |\nNYS tax table |\n| AND NYS taxable income is $65,000 or more (line 37) | NYS tax rate schedule | |\n| NYS adjusted gross income is more than $107,650 (line 32) | NYS tax computation |\nNew York State tax rate schedule\nIf your New York adjusted gross income amount on Form IT-203, line 32, is more than $107,650, see Tax computation – New York adjusted gross income of more than $107,650 below to calculate your New York State tax.\n| If line 37 is: | The tax is: | |||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| over | but not over | |||||\n| $0 | $17,150 | 4% | of line 37 | |||\n| 17,150 | 23,600 | $686 | plus | 4.5% | of the excess over | $17,150 |\n| 23,600 | 27,900 | 976 | plus | 5.25% | of the excess over | 23,600 |\n| 27,900 | 161,550 | 1,202 | plus | 5.5% | of the excess over | 27,900 |\n| 161,550 | 323,200 | 8,553 | plus | 6% | of the excess over | 161,550 |\n| 323,200 | 2,155,350 | 18,252 | plus | 6.85% | of the excess over | 323,200 |\n| 2,155,350 | 5,000,000 | 143,754 | plus | 9.65% | of the excess over | 2,155,350 |\n| 5,000,000 | 25,000,000 | 418,263 | plus | 10.3% | of the excess over | 5,000,000 |\n| 25,000,000 | ---- | 2,478,263 | plus | 10.9% | of the excess over | 25,000,000 |\n| If line 37 is: | The tax is: | |||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| over | but not over | |||||\n| $0 | $8,500 | 4% | of line 37 | |||\n| 8,500 | 11,700 | $340 | plus | 4.5% | of the excess over | $8,500 |\n| 11,700 | 13,900 | 484 | plus | 5.25% | of the excess over | 11,700 |\n| 13,900 | 80,650 | 600 | plus | 5.5% | of the excess over | 13,900 |\n| 80,650 | 215,400 | 4,271 | plus | 6% | of the excess over | 80,650 |\n| 215,400 | 1,077,550 | 12,356 | plus | 6.85% | of the excess over | 215,400 |\n| 1,077,550 | 5,000,000 | 71,413 | plus | 9.65% | of the excess over | 1,077,550 |\n| 5,000,000 | 25,000,000 | 449,929 | plus | 10.3% | of the excess over | 5,000,000 |\n| 25,000,000 | ---- | 2,509,929 | plus | 10.9% | of the excess over | 25,000,000 |\n| If line 37 is: | The tax is: | |||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| over | but not over | |||||\n| $0 | $12,800 | 4% | of line 37 | |||\n| 12,800 | 17,650 | $512 | plus | 4.5% | of the excess over | $12,800 |\n| 17,650 | 20,900 | 730 | plus | 5.25% | of the excess over | 17,650 |\n| 20,900 | 107,650 | 901 | plus | 5.5% | of the excess over | 20,900 |\n| 107,650 | 269,300 | 5,672 | plus | 6% | of the excess over | 107,650 |\n| 269,300 | 1,616,450 | 15,371 | plus | 6.85% | of the excess over | 269,300 |\n| 1,616,450 | 5,000,000 | 107,651 | plus | 9.65% | of the excess over | 1,616,450 |\n| 5,000,000 | 25,000,000 | 434,163 | plus | 10.3% | of the excess over | 5,000,000 |\n| 25,000,000 | ---- | 2,494,163 | plus | 10.9% | of the excess over | 25,000,000 |\nTax computation—New York adjusted gross income of more than $107,650\nNew York State tax\nFind your New York State tax by using the correct tax computation worksheet within your filing status (see below).\nMarried filing jointly and qualifying surviving spouse\n| If your New York adjusted gross income (line 32) is more than $107,650, but not more than $25,000,000, and your taxable income (line 37) is $161,550 or less, then you must calculate your tax using this worksheet. | |\n| 1.

There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

What does that mean?\nNew York City has elected a democratic socialist as its next mayor.\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won with a progressive platform focused on making the city more affordable, through free bus service, frozen rents, universal childcare and a higher minimum wage, among other ideas.\nThe state assemblymember represented both the Democratic Party and the Working Families Party on the ballot. He quoted prominent late-19th and early-20th century socialist Eugene Debs in his victory speech Tuesday night. And he is a longtime member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).\nIts New York City chapter played a key role in Mamdani's campaign, providing an early endorsement and a legion of volunteers for canvassing and fundraising — and raising its own profile in the process.\n\"Since [Mamdani's] primary win in June, Democratic Socialism has soared in popularity here and across the nation,\" the NYC-DSA tweeted after his general election win. \"Our unprecedented growth is a testament to our vision and our ability to inspire renewed hope and political engagement from the working class.\"\nAs Mamdani's campaign pushed democratic socialism further into the mainstream, it has also raised questions about what the political ideology is — and isn't.\nMost notably, President Trump has frequently and falsely criticized Mamdani as a communist in the lead-up to the election. Mamdani refuted that characterization in a June appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, to which he responded, \"I am not.\"\nMamdani went on to describe his brand of democratic socialism, a term that is largely up to interpretation.\n\"When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. King from decades ago who said, 'Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God's children in this country,'\" he said, referring to a 1961 speech by Martin Luther King Jr. \"And as income inequality has declined nationwide, it has increased in New York City. And, ultimately, what we need is a city where every single person can thrive.\"\nWhat is democratic socialism?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all definition of democratic socialism, though its adherents broadly support the government taking control over certain sectors of the economy, such as health care and utilities, to benefit the public rather than private corporations.\n\"We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation,\" reads the DSA's website.\nThe DSA, which has been around since the 1980s, calls itself the largest socialist organization in the U.S. It says it has more than 80,000 members organized into campus and community chapters across all 50 states.\nThe group says its members are socialists because they reject an international economic order sustained by things like private profit, discrimination and violence \"in defense of the status quo,\" and instead envision a more equitable and humane social order \"based both on democratic planning and market mechanisms.\"\nDemocratic socialists often distance themselves from historic examples of socialism and communism, which have had largely negative connotations in the U.S. since the Cold War era. Proponents also say democratic socialism goes further than \"social democracy,\" which often involves a strong welfare state operating under capitalism.\n\"We believe there are many avenues that feed into the democratic road to socialism,\" the DSA says. \"Our vision pushes further than historic social democracy and leaves behind authoritarian visions of socialism in the dustbin of history.\"\nThe Communist Party USA says that while it shares some values of democratic socialists — like opposing war and wanting higher minimum wage — it believes those can only happen through a fundamental restructuring of society.\nMany democratic socialists acknowledge that radical transformation won't happen in the short term, so they use tools like organizing, lobbying and protesting in hopes of making change within the existing system, at least for now.\n\"As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people,\" it explains, naming single-payer Medicare for All and the Green New Deal as examples.\nWhy is democratic socialism on the rise?\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont put democratic socialism on many peoples' radars during his 2016 presidential campaign.\nWhile a registered independent, Sanders has described himself as a democratic socialist for decades, the ideology shaping his stances on everything from poverty to health care to higher education.\nSanders is not a member of the DSA. But his candidacy is credited with boosting the organization's membership and visibility, just in time for the first Trump presidency.\nHolly Otterbein, an Axios reporter who has covered the rise of socialism, told NPR's It's Been a Minute earlier this week that she saw the biggest increase in DSA membership after Trump's 2016 win.\n\"When I've talked to people who have become members of the DSA or DSA leaders, they felt like that 2016 election sort of discredited the Democratic Party in their eyes,\" she said.\nMany young voters have become discontented with the Democratic Party, a trend that has continued through the COVID-19 pandemic, economic turbulence and now Trump's second term. All of that has fueled the democratic socialist movement.\n\"Socialism is a recurring talking point for people that still can't find ways to get out of the economic precarity that their generation and the immediately prior generations couldn't get out of,\" Lex McMenamin, head of the politics section at Teen Vogue, told It's Been a Minute.\nA Gallup poll released in September found that roughly two-thirds of Democrats view socialism positively, up from 50% in 2010, even as Americans as a whole continue to view capitalism more favorably.\nWhat could Mamdani's win mean for the movement?\nRecent years have seen the elections of DSA members including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\nBoth Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez — as well as the NYC-DSA — endorsed Mamdani before the primary in June, and have headlined rallies with him in the months since.\nAfter Mamdani's win on Tuesday, an NBC reporter asked Ocasio-Cortez how she would define democratic socialism.\n\"To me, it's this radical idea that working people have economic rights,\" she said, listing housing, a livable wage, health care and child care as examples.\nPolitical scientists have cautioned that Mamdani's approach may not be a winning blueprint for democratic socialist candidates running outside of New York City, where registered Democrats heavily outnumber Republicans. But supporters see lessons in his success.\n\"He had to defeat a Republican and the old guard of the Democratic party at the same time,\" Ocasio-Cortez told CNN, referring to Curtis Sliwa and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \"And he still won resoundingly.\n\"And I think the message that that sends is that the Democratic Party cannot last much longer by denying the future, by trying to undercut our young, by trying to undercut a next generation of diverse and upcoming Democrats that ... our actual electorate and voters support.\"\nNYC's DSA is already touting Mamdani's victory in recruitment efforts, calling it just the beginning. Notably, Mamdani stressed during his campaign that his platform differs from that of the DSA, and has taken a more moderate stance on issues like eliminating misdemeanor offenses and defunding the police.\nMcMenamin, of Teen Vogue, says Mamdani's mayorship could change what socialism means to people, depending on how he governs.\n\"I think people are going to really want to talk about socialism if some of these policy changes actually start coming into effect,\" McMenamin adds. \"And so what could happen in New York over the next year could make a big change for people in all 50 states.\"\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \"The Speech\" is what Ronald Reagan called it. Today we call it, \"A Time for Choosing,\" and it was a pivotal turning point in Reagan's Life.\nRonald Reagan began a long side-career of public speaking as his acting career closed out. He traveled across the country meeting Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, Chambers of Commerce and any other civic-minded local groups. This continued and intensified during his service as the General Electric spokesperson while hosting their sponsored television series.\n\"The Speech\" was delivered in various forms and to different audiences as each word was honed, measured and memorized.\nDuring the 1964 Presidential campaign, Republican party officials in California, who knew Reagan's powerful message and delivery, asked him to film a speech on behalf of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater. The speech was aired on October 27, 1964 and it was electrifying. Donations to the Republican party and candidates increased dramatically.\nThe Republican Party took note and they targeted Reagan as a candidate from that point forward. He agreed in 1966 to run for Governor of California. He won two terms, and eventually won the Presidency.\nTranscript of \"A Time for Choosing,\" delivered on national television on October 27, 1964\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you and good evening. The sponsor has been identified, but unlike most television programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script. As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks.\nI have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines. Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used, \"We've never had it so good.\"\nBut I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future. No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income. Today, 37 cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector's share, and yet our government continues to spend 17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in. We haven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years. We've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months, and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world. We have 15 billion dollars in gold in our treasury; we don't own an ounce. Foreign dollar claims are 27.3 billion dollars. And we've just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its total value.\nAs for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely. Do they mean peace, or do they mean we just want to be left in peace? There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us. We're at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars, and it's been said if we lose that war, and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening. Well I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the Founding Fathers.\nNot too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to a Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said, \"We don't know how lucky we are.\" And the Cuban stopped and said, \"How lucky you are? I had someplace to escape to.\" And in that sentence he told us the entire story. If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth.\nAnd this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man.\nThis is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There's only an up or down - [up] man's old-aged dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course.\nIn this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the \"Great Society,\" or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people. But they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print. These are not Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that say, \"The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism.\" Another voice says, \"The profit motive has become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state.\" Or, \"Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century.\" Senator Fullbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the President as \"our moral teacher and our leader,\" and he says he is \"hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document.\" He must \"be freed,\" so that he \"can do for us\" what he knows \"is best.\" And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as \"meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government.\"\nWell, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as \"the masses.\" This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, \"the full power of centralized government\"this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.\nNow, we have no better example of this than government's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since 1955, the cost of this program has nearly doubled. One-fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85 percent of the farm surplus. Three-fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21 percent increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce. You see, that one-fourth of farming that's regulated and controlled by the federal government. In the last three years we've spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow.\nSenator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater, as President, would seek to eliminate farmers. He should do his homework a little better, because he'll find out that we've had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government programs. He'll also find that the Democratic administration has sought to get from Congress [an] extension of the farm program to include that three-fourths that is now free. He'll find that they've also asked for the right to imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government. The Secretary of Agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals. And contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove 2 million farmers from the soil.\nAt the same time, there's been an increase in the Department of Agriculture employees. There's now one for every 30 farms in the United States, and still they can't tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for Austria disappeared without a trace and Billie Sol Estes never left shore.\nEvery responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy, but how - who are farmers to know what's best for them? The wheat farmers voted against a wheat program. The government passed it anyway. Now the price of bread goes up; the price of wheat to the farmer goes down.\nMeanwhile, back in the city, under urban renewal the assault on freedom carries on. Private property rights [are] so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few government planners decide it should be. In a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy, we see such spectacles as in Cleveland, Ohio, a million-and-a-half-dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed to make way for what government officials call a \"more compatible use of the land.\" The President tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands, where heretofore we've only built them in the hundreds. But FHA [Federal Housing Authority] and the Veterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure. For three decades, we've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning, and the more the plans fail, the more the planners plan. The latest is the Area Redevelopment Agency.\nThey've just declared Rice County, Kansas, a depressed area. Rice County, Kansas, has two hundred oil wells, and the 14,000 people there have over 30 million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks. And when the government tells you you're depressed, lie down and be depressed.\nWe have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one. So they're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning. Well, now, if government planning and welfare had the answer - and they've had almost 30 years of it - shouldn't we expect government to read the score to us once in a while? Shouldn't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help? The reduction in the need for public housing?\nBut the reverse is true. Each year the need grows greater; the program grows greater. We were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry each night. Well that was probably true. They were all on a diet. But now we're told that 9.3 million families in this country are poverty-stricken on the basis of earning less than 3,000 dollars a year. Welfare spending [is] 10 times greater than in the dark depths of the Depression. We're spending 45 billion dollars on welfare. Now do a little arithmetic, and you'll find that if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9 million poor families, we'd be able to give each family 4,600 dollars a year. And this added to their present income should eliminate poverty. Direct aid to the poor, however, is only running only about 600 dollars per family. It would seem that someplace there must be some overhead.\nNow, so now we declare \"war on poverty,\" or \"You, too, can be a Bobby Baker.\" Now do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion we're spending, one more program to the 30-odd we have -and remember, this new program doesn't replace any, it just duplicates existing programs - do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic? Well, in all fairness I should explain there is one part of the new program that isn't duplicated. This is the youth feature. We're now going to solve the dropout problem, juvenile delinquency, by reinstituting something like the old CCC camps [Civilian Conservation Corps], and we're going to put our young people in these camps. But again we do some arithmetic, and we find that we're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help 4,700 dollars a year. We can send them to Harvard for 2,700! Course, don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting Harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency.\nBut seriously, what are we doing to those we seek to help? Not too long ago, a judge called me here in Los Angeles. He told me of a young woman who'd come before him for a divorce. She had six children, was pregnant with her seventh. Under his questioning, she revealed her husband was a laborer earning 250 dollars a month. She wanted a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise. She's eligible for 330 dollars a month in the Aid to Dependent Children Program. She got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who'd already done that very thing.\nYet anytime you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals. They say we're always \"against\" things - we're never \"for\" anything.\nWell, the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so.\nNow, we're for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age, and to that end we've accepted Social Security as a step toward meeting the problem.\nBut we're against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood. They've called it \"insurance\" to us in a hundred million pieces of literature. But then they appeared before the Supreme Court and they testified it was a welfare program. They only use the term \"insurance\" to sell it to the people. And they said Social Security dues are a tax for the general use of the government, and the government has used that tax. There is no fund, because Robert Byers, the actuarial head, appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that Social Security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole. But he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax, they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble. And they're doing just that.\nA young man, 21 years of age, working at an average salary - his Social Security contribution would, in the open market, buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65. The government promises 127. He could live it up until he's 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than Social Security. Now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a sound basis, so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they're due, that the cupboard isn't bare?\nBarry Goldwater thinks we can.\nAt the same time, can't we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non-earning years? Should we not allow a widow with children to work, and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband? Shouldn't you and I be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program, which we cannot do? I think we're for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds. But I think we're against forcing all citizens, regardless of need, into a compulsory government program, especially when we have such examples, as was announced last week, when France admitted that their Medicare program is now bankrupt. They've come to the end of the road.\nIn addition, was Barry Goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate, planned inflation, so that when you do get your Social Security pension, a dollar will buy a dollar's worth, and not 45 cents worth?\nI think we're for an international organization, where the nations of the world can seek peace. But I think we're against subordinating American interests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound that today you can muster a two-thirds vote on the floor of the General Assembly among nations that represent less than 10 percent of the world's population. I think we're against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony, while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the Soviet colonies in the satellite nations.\nI think we're for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs, but we're against doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy, if not socialism, all over the world. We set out to help 19 countries. We're helping 107. We've spent 146 billion dollars. With that money, we bought a 2 million dollar yacht for Haile Selassie. We bought dress suits for Greek undertakers, extra wives for Kenya[n] government officials. We bought a thousand TV sets for a place where they have no electricity. In the last six years, 52 nations have bought 7 billion dollars worth of our gold, and all 52 are receiving foreign aid from this country.\nNo government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. So governments' programs, once launched, never disappear.\nActually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.\nFederal employees - federal employees number two and a half million; and federal, state, and local, one out of six of the nation's work force employed by government. These proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards. How many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant? They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work.\nLast February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket, said, \"If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States.\" I think that's exactly what he will do.\nBut as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died, because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.\nNow it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the, or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.\nOur Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men - that we're to choose just between two personalities.\nWell what of this man that they would destroy, and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been privileged to know him \"when.\" I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.\nThis is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there.\nAn ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that [there were] a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, \"Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such,\" and they went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.\nDuring the hectic split-second timing of a campaign, this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer. His campaign managers were understandably impatient, but he said, \"There aren't many left who care what happens to her. I'd like her to know I care.\" This is a man who said to his 19-year-old son, \"There is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness, and when you begin to build your life on that rock, with the cement of the faith in God that you have, then you have a real start.\" This is not a man who could carelessly send other people's sons to war. And that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems I've discussed academic, unless we realize we're in a war that must be won.\nThose who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory. They call their policy \"accommodation.\" And they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us. All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers to complex problems. Well, perhaps there is a simple answer - not an easy answer but simple: If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right.\nWe cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, \"Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters.\" Alexander Hamilton said, \"A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one.\" Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second - surrender.\nAdmittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face, that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand, the ultimatum. And what then, when Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for \"peace at any price\" or \"better Red than dead,\" or as one commentator put it, he'd rather \"live on his knees than die on his feet.\" And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us.\nYou and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin - just in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all.\nYou and I have the courage to say to our enemies, \"There is a price we will not pay.\" \"There is a point beyond which they must not advance.\" And this - this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater's \"peace through strength.\" Winston Churchill said, \"The destiny of man is not measured by material computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits - not animals.\" And he said, \"There's something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty.\"\nYou and I have a rendezvous with destiny.\nWe'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.\nWe will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwater has faith in us. He has faith that you and I have the ability and the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        October 10, 1952\n[1.] BATAVIA, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 10:42 a.m.)\nI enjoyed my stop here very much in 1948, and I am glad to be back. I am here, if you don't know it--I am here campaigning for the Democratic ticket.\nI have enjoyed meeting your local candidates. I hope you will support them. And vote for them: for Senator, John Cashmore, he will make a fine colleague for Governor Lehman, who is one of the best Senators in the Senate; and for Congress, Richard Judson.\nFor President we have a very able man-Adlai Stevenson. He is the best new leader to come along since franklin Roosevelt. Like Roosevelt, Stevenson has been a fine, progressive Governor of one of our great States. And, like Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson is a real friend of the plain everyday\nJohn Sparkman is his running mate, and he is the same kind of man. He is a true progressive, a real friend of the farmer, and of labor--always fighting for the people.\nThese are men you can trust to understand your problems and work for your interests.\nI have here a copy of the Batavia Daily News for September 12. It was sent to me the other day, and on the front page is a news story that interests me very much. The headline says: \"Production Workers in Demand . . . Area Manufacturing Plants Report . . . Jobs . . . Unfilled.\" Then the article says: \"Batavia area industries are in urgent need of manpower . . . production and factory workers are in top demand in Batavia.\"\nNow that's fine. That is what I like to see. That shows that our full employment policy is working. And, my friends, it is working not only here, it is working all over the country.\nThe Republicans have been going around saying that all this is artificial, this prosperity we have. They say it's all because of the defense effort. Otherwise, to hear them talk, we would be having a depression right now.\nWell, that just isn't so. We were enjoying prosperity--the greatest ever--in the first half of 1950, before we had this big defense effort.\nOur prosperity is a lot more solid than the Republicans would have you think. It is solid because for 20 years the people have had a government that believes in prosperity and full employment.\nTake our social security program and our minimum wage laws, and our policy of encouraging workers to organize and bargain collectively with their employers. These things help greatly to boost the incomes of the working people.\nBy our policies toward the workingman, we have helped build up the markets of the farmer and the businessman.\nAnd by our progressive farm programs, we have helped the farmer to increase his income, so that he can be a consumer of the products that the city workers make.\nThese are the ways we keep our prosperity strong and healthy and growing all the time.\nNow the Republicans have never understood this. All they can think of is profits. And it never occurs to them that the way to make more profits is by building up the buying power of our people.\nThe Republicans in Congress have fought and hampered almost every measure we have devised to help the working people. They fought social security. They fought minimum wages. They fought the Wagner Act. They even fought and voted against the full employment bill we passed in 1946. In 1946 we still had a Democratic Congress. That was before that terrible 80th Congress came in.\nNow, you working people here, I give you fair warning. The Republicans in Congress, the Old Guard who run the party, have always stood and voted against your interests. And they are taking the same stand today.\nRead their party platform. Read the speeches of their five-star candidate. Or better still, read what Senator Taft says the candidate believes in. Then you will know the Republicans are still the same as always-and no friends of the ordinary man.\nAnd you farmers around here, don't you think you can stand by while the Republicans put the squeeze on the working people. I am told that four-fifths of the farmers around here participate in our agricultural conservation program. Well, did you know that just this last year a big majority of the Republicans in Congress voted to cut out three-fourths of the funds for that very program? Of course you didn't know it. The kept press won't tell you about it, and if you don't read the Congressional Record you never will find out what goes on in the Congress.\nThe Democrats saved the money this time, but what do you think will happen next year, if the Republicans grab off the Congress and the White House, too?\nYou had better find out about the people who represent you down in Washington. You had better think about who is for you, and who is against you. You had better realize that the farmers and workers are on the same side of the fence, no matter what the Republican orators may tell you.\nAnd you had better go and vote for the party that has always looked after the farmer, and the worker, and all the plain people. And that is the Democratic Party.\nThink of your own interests when you go to the polls. Now you are the Government-you are the Government, and when you don't vote in your own interests and you don't vote for progress in this country you are just injuring yourselves.\nNow I want to say to you young people, you had better do a little studying for the future, because it is going to be your turn to run this Government pretty soon. You had better find out what it means to go forward, instead of trying to turn the clock back to William McKinley. If you look out for your own interests, you will go home and tell your mama and papa to vote the Democratic ticket and keep the country safe another 4 years.\n[2.] ROCHESTER, NEW YORK (Station platform, 11:30 a.m.)\nI am delighted to see so many people here today. I had a most wonderful reception when I was here the last time.\nI understand that the newspapers of New York State are supporting the Republicans about 12 to 1 in the Republican campaign of misrepresentation now going on. So I am glad to have this opportunity to get some of the real facts and issues out into the open.\nFirst of all, I want to urge you to go to the polls on November the 4th and elect Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman as President and Vice President.\nThey're a first-class team, a team that will carry on the splendid traditions of the Democratic Party.\nThese traditions have a lot of roots here in New York. This is the State of Al Smith, of franklin Roosevelt, and of Herbert Lehman. Adlai Stevenson is of the same mold as those three great Democratic Governors. His administration in Illinois has been one of the most able and progressive the State has ever had. He will go down in the history of this Nation as one of its ablest Presidents.\nAdlai Stevenson is a man of whom the Democratic Party can be, and is, extremely proud.\nI also want to urge you to send to the Congress two men who will uphold the great traditions of New York Democracy: John Cashmore for the United States Senate; and Victor Kruppenbacher for the House of Representatives. Adlai Stevenson will need the support of men like these in this critical period.\nNow, I have been on a trip all across the country, talking to the people, trying to put a lot of facts into the record. The Republicans in this campaign are telling more half truths--more deliberate, unvarnished lies-than in any other campaign in my recollection. And I can remember them for 40 years.\nNow the Republican candidate for President hasn't even tried to talk about the issues. Instead, he's gone around the country putting out a smoke screen to hide the issues. He's shouting--just give me a chance, and I'll pour it on them--about corruption in the Government, when he knows that only a tiny fraction of the Government's 2½ million employees have even the slightest taint of corruption on them. And he knows that the corrupt employees have been fired, have been tried and convicted where the laws have been violated. He knows that we have reorganized the Government and reduced the number of patronage jobs.\nHe's gone around the country making these loose charges about communism in the Government. He knows better than that. He knows that for years the Government has had an effective program to keep the Communists out of Government service.\nIn the end, the people are not going to be fooled by a campaign of lies. They are not going to be taken in by a smoke screen campaign. In the end, they're going to vote on the issues, as they always have. They're going to demand that the Republican candidate take a stand on the issues.\nAnd that will be fatal for the Republican candidate. He doesn't know anything about most of the issues. He's been a military man all his life. And his speeches show that since he left the Army he hasn't even attempted to master the complex problems of civil government that he would have to face as President.\nThe Republican candidate did take a stand on one issue, and that's what I want to tell you about today. Along with being in favor of honesty and against sin, he's in favor of the expansion of American industry. He has taken a firm and unequivocal stand in favor of building our economy. And that, he says, requires \"a wholly new climate in Washington.\"\nThat sounds as if the idea of a growing and expanding economy was a new one to him. It sounds as if someone had just told him about it. What kind of economy, I wonder, does the man think we have? An expanding economy has been the central objective of the Democratic Party throughout these postwar years. Our achievements in the expansion of the economy are some of our proudest achievements. There has never been anything to equal them in the history of the world.\nThe Republican candidate has shown that he has no understanding at all of what's been going on in our economy.\nOur total national production is now $336 billion a year--almost three times what it was in 1932 and twice what it was in the peak year of the Republicans in 1929. And that's after making adjustments for price changes. In other words, the production of our economy has grown as much in the last 20 years, under the Democratic administrations, as it had grown in the whole history of the Republic up to that time. And yet the Republican candidate says we need Republicans \"to revive in the American economy its inherent power to grow.\" That's just poppycock!\nRight now, the American economy is adding to its productive plant at the fastest rate in all its history. Private capital is investing in new plant and equipment at the rate of about $30 billion a year. Think of it--$30 billion a year. That indicates the response of private enterprise to a climate in Washington that has never been more favorable to it.\nAll this growth makes this country much stronger in case we ever had to defend ourselves against Communist aggression. But these new plants will also be a tremendous resource when the defense program tapers off. They can be used for making all the things we need that we haven't been able to make in the last 2 years because of the defense program.\nNow just why do the Republicans want to change the climate in Washington that's bringing about the greatest industrial expansion in the history of the world?\nI'll tell you why they want to change the climate. The Republicans don't like the way the benefits of our prosperity are distributed. They want to see more of the profits of the American enterprise go into the dividends of the big corporations and less of it into the pockets of workingmen, the small businessmen, and the farmers.\nNow, my friends, that is the issue, pure and simple. They want to rewrite the tax laws to give the breaks to big business. They want to rewrite the price control law to let the speculators make a killing. They want to rewrite the labor laws to make them even more biased against labor than the Taft-Hartley Act already is.\nThat's what the Republicans mean when they talk about a change in Washington.\nBut they're completely shortsighted about the whole issue. They're still as shortsighted as they were in the Republican 1920's when the whole object of the Government policy was to help the rich and the privileged.\nThe thing the Republicans have never understood is that when only big business is helped, the country as a whole is hurt. Eventually, big business and everybody else is dragged down in a general depression-which happened in 1929.\nYou don't have a prosperous country unless the little man--the farmer, the worker, the small businessman--is well off, too. And when the little man prospers, big business gets along just fine.\nWe have proved that point over and over again since World War II. At the end of the war, the Republicans hooted at the whole idea of having 60 million jobs. We now have more than 62 million people employed, at good wages. Farm prices and farm income are high. This is good for the farmers and for the workers. It's good for the shopkeepers and the salesmen and everybody else who has things to sell.\nAnd what about corporations? Believe me, they're doing all right.\nCorporate profits before taxes in 1950 were almost $40 billion, and last year they were $43 billion. That is more than four times the profits earned in 1929--the peak year before the Republican depression. And it compares with a net loss of $3 billion in 1932--the bottom year of the Republican depression.\nEven after taxes, corporations made $21 billion in profits in 1950 and $19 billion last year--more than double the 1929 earnings.\nThe Republican candidate can't deny we're having prosperity with a Democratic climate in Washington. So he resorts to the false charge that we have what he calls a \"war prosperity\" created by the defense program. The answer to that is very clear. All he has to do is to look at the figures for 1948 and 1949 and 1950, before the defense program got underway. We were breaking all kinds of records in 1950.\nAnd I just want to remind you that the period after World War II--when this present so-called \"bungling\" administration was in office--was the first time in our history that a major war has not been followed by a depression.\nIt's just plain dishonest for the Republican candidate to overlook these facts.\nNow, I know that many of you are concerned about what is going to happen when the defense program tapers off. Will there be jobs to take up the slack?\nNobody knows, of course, exactly what lies. ahead of us. But this much I will say to you--there can be jobs to take up the slack when the defense program drops away. It may not happen, if your Government follows the wrong policies. But if you have a government that follows the right policies, our post-defense economy can boom to even greater levels than those we now enjoy.\nI say that with confidence because I am aware of all the peacetime work that has been piling up while we've been building our defenses. This work will still need doing as fast as money and materials become available again. And in the aggregate, this work should more than counterbalance any cutbacks in defense that we can now foresee.\nUltimately, of course, the reason we can look forward to future economic growth rests in our solid and expanding consumer markets, based on a full employment policy. These markets will grow as population grows--and it is rising fast. With proper programs to help assure good incomes for our workers and our farmers--with more and better social security, minimum wages, farm price supports, and other measures-we can be confident that our consumers will have funds to buy what we produce.\nFor all these reasons I am confident we can keep full employment, keep our country growing and need suffer no depression, if and when the defense effort slacks off. But I am just as sure that these things will not come about, unless our National Government is dedicated heart and soul, to a national policy of continuing expansion and full employment.\nYou cannot count on that kind of government from the Republican Party.\nThe Republican Party is controlled and dominated by big businessmen. To them, full employment is something that's perfectly all right if it just happens, but not something to get terribly concerned about. They don't believe in using, or do they know how to use, the powers of government to keep this economy on an even keel. They let you down in the 1930's, before you sent your great Governor, franklin Roosevelt, down to Washington. They'll do it again, if you give them a chance.\nThe Democratic Party, on the other hand, is committed to a policy of full employment. It is made up of ordinary people to whom full employment is a matter of bread and butter, or life and death. The Democratic Party has achieved full employment in the difficult postwar years. It understands a basic economic fact--that to have full employment the Government has got to concern itself with the little man--with the farmer, the worker, and the small businessman.\nThe Democratic Party is not going to let you down.\nNow you people--you people are the Government. The Constitution says that the power of government is in the people. They exercise that power when they go to the polls to vote. It is your duty to familiarize yourselves with the record of the Democratic Party in the Congress and the record of the Republican Party in the Congress; and then decide which, in your judgment, is the best party to have in control of your Government for the next 4 years. I will leave that to the record. If you will read the record, you can't do but one thing, and that is to send Adlai Stevenson to the White House.\n[3.] SYRACUSE, NEW YORK (Near station, 1:25 p.m.)\nI am happy to be here today again. You gave me a wonderful reception 4 years ago, even if it was raining cats and dogs all the time I was here.\nThis year, I am not campaigning for myself. I am out working for a new man on the Democratic ticket, my good friend Adlai Stevenson of Illinois. Adlai Stevenson has an outstanding record of public service. He is a man the people can trust.\nI understand that you people here are really to be congratulated. I am told that Thomas Corcoran is the first Democratic mayor your city has had in 24 years, and I congratulate you on it.\nNow this year you have a chance to follow that excellent example by sending Arthur McGuire to the House, and John Cashmore to the Senate to really represent you in the Congress as you should be.\nI have been traveling for 2 weeks now, through about 20 States. I have seen a lot of this country, and I can tell you this great Nation of ours is in good shape. Never has there been as much growth or so much activity as there is today. That is true up and down this land of ours, just as it is here in this great State of New York.\nPrivate enterprise is confident of the future. Large and small businesses are enjoying good profits. Their customers have money, because we have good farm prices and good wages, and steady jobs for all who want them.\nWe have almost forgotten that there can be such things as mass unemployment, bank failures, dollar-a-day wages, and 30-cent wheat. Those things have long been banished, along with the Republicans who brought them upon us.\nNow, what is the reason for this confidence and this prosperity? It is very, very simple. The programs of the Federal Government in the past 20 years have made America a land of individual security, and at the same time a land of tremendous opportunity.\nIn these 20 years the Democratic Party has shown that individual security and opportunity go together. They must be worked for together, and the Democrats know how to do it.\nThe Republican Party in Congress has opposed almost all our programs to help the economic life of the country. The Republican Party has blindly turned its back on the tradition of public action for the public good.\nI wonder why they have done that? Well, it is because the Republican Party has become a collection of special interest groups. A special interest group, by definition, can never see beyond the limits of its own greed for the almighty dollar.\nThe insurance companies, back in 1935 and 1936, couldn't see anything in social security beyond the fact they would not be writing the insurance policies. So they were against it--and they got the Republican Party against it.\nThe utility companies couldn't see anything in our great public power projects beyond the fact that private companies would not make a profit on the power. So they were against these projects, and automatically the Republican Party came out against them, too. Al Smith and Franklin Roosevelt taught you people all about that, many years ago.\nThe real estate lobby couldn't see anything in low-cost public housing beyond the fact that houses were going to be built and their members would not make any money out of them. So they were against public housing, and automatically the Republican Party came out against public housing.\nAnd so it goes, down through the whole list. The policies of the Republican Party are the total of all the negative attitudes of all the special groups that put money into and pull the strings for the Republican Party.\nNow, this year, the special interest groups that are in the Republican Party have as their candidate a man who has been in the Army and out of civilian life for over 40 years. Until last June, he had lived the specialized life of the soldier, under orders all the time.\nThe great issues that mean bread and butter to a lot of us, have passed him by completely. He has had the cares of an Army officer, but not those of a civilian trying to make a living. He has never met a payroll in his life, nor carried a precinct--and he doesn't know a special interest lobby when he sees one.\nNow this is just the kind of man the special interests can move in on, and take over. And that is exactly what they have been doing. The General told the Republican Convention in July that he would lead them on a \"great crusade.\" But he did not tell them what the crusade was going to be about.\nLike all good generals, he was waiting for his objective to be set by higher authority. He was ready to lead the troops, but he didn't know what the campaign was for. That was a problem that he as a military man had never had to decide for himself before, so the Republican Old Guard moved in and wrote his orders for him.\nThe directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years.\nSocialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security.\nSocialism is what they called farm price supports.\nSocialism is what they called bank deposit insurance.\nSocialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations.\nSocialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people.\nWhen the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all.\nWhat he really means is, \"Down with Progress--down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's fair Deal.\" That is what he means.\nNow, it is a sad thing to see this man led around by those of little faith and no vision. It is a sad thing to see this man betraying his principles, deserting his friends, all for the sake of the votes he hopes to gain from Taft and Jenner and McCarthy.\nThis campaign has already demonstrated that a military man should stick to his profession. We do not need any additional proof.\nI can think of no worse combination in the White House than a military man, ignorant of all our problems, surrounded and controlled by the most backward-looking politicians in our national life.\nMy friends, don't turn the country over to that Republican combination. Look out for your own interests. You are the Government. The Constitution of the United States says the power of the Government in this great Nation of ours shall rest in the people. And when you exercise that power, you can only do it by votes.\nWhen you go to the polls on the 4th of November and exercise the power of government-which is in you--you must look out for your own interests, you must look out for the interests of this great Nation, you must look out for the interests of the world as a whole--the free countries as a whole, for which we are now responsible.\nI urge you--study the issues. Read the record. Read the record of both parties-the Republicans in the Congress and the Democrats in the Congress--because they are the ones that make the policy. It is not made on the stump.\nThe record I am pointing to is a record that has been in your interest. The record these gentlemen are talking about doesn't exist--for they haven't any record, except what is bad for the people.\nGo to the polls now and exercise your authority as the power in the Government. Send Adlai Stevenson to the White House, and we will have 4 more years of good government.\nThank you very much.\n[4.] ONEIDA, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 2:10 p.m.)\nI am certainly happy to be back in your good city again this afternoon. I want to thank that band for coming out again, like they did when I was here in 1948. You remember I held the train for the band before. You were very nice to me when I stopped here 4 years ago. Now I realize that this area has a reputation for being pretty strongly Republican, but I think we ought to be able to make a lot of converts to the Democratic way this year.\nIf you vote Democratic, you can count on continuing to have a government that is in your interests and for your welfare. I hope you will vote to send good Democrats down to Washington to represent you there. The candidate for Senator--who was just introduced to you by Senator Lehman--John Cashmore, is a wonderful man. I have known him a long time. And I know that Dr. Wilson will give you the right sort of representation in the Congress.\nNationally, the Democratic ticket is headed by two of the best men who ever ran for President and Vice President: Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman. Adlai Stevenson has made a wonderful record as Governor of Illinois, and I know he will make a great President. He will fight for the plain people of the country, and he will see to it that this is the kind of country you want to live in, and want your children to grow up in.\nThe most important thing of all is that Governor Stevenson is a man of peace. You know, the President of the United States has the most important job in the world. He has more to do with whether or not we shall have peace in the world than any other individual in the world. These are critical times we are going through, because the danger of Communist aggression threatens us with another world war. It will take all our wisdom and courage and patience, and a lot of hard work, to avoid an all-out war.\nGovernor Stevenson understands these things. If you have been listening to his speeches, you know that he has met the foreign policy issues frankly and honestly. He has not been hiding behind vague generalities.\nNobody wants war, and the Republican candidate is no exception; he doesn't want war either. But in this struggle for peace, we have to have more than good intentions. A military life is good training, but good training for only one thing, and that is training for war, and the preparation for war. It is not training in the ways of preventing war. That has always been the job of the civilian head of the Government of the United States.\nThe President of the United States, in his capacity as Chief Executive, and in his capacity as Commander in Chief, makes the policies of the United States that can lead to either peace or war. He is the man, for example, who has to decide whether or not to use the atomic bomb.\nYou want to be careful to get a man on that job who can stand up under pressure.\nSince the Republican candidate started running for President, he has been yielding to some strange advice on foreign policy. He has said some things about liberating foreign peoples that could get us into serious, very serious, trouble if they were followed through to their logical conclusions. He also said some rash and foolish things about big cuts in defense spending, which would cripple our Armed forces and our allies. He seems to have swallowed Senator Taft's whole foreign policy in the guise of a budget cut.\nI am not altogether sure that he knows the significance of what he has been saying, and that makes it worse. We cannot afford to have a President who is careless about things like this.\nI have worked for peace for 7 long years. I want world peace above everything else in the world; and I am sure that you feel the same way about it. No man can promise you peace with absolute certainty; but I believe with all my heart our best chance for world peace lies with the election of Adlai Stevenson.\nSo I say to you, for your own welfare here at home, for the good of your great State, and for the welfare of this great country of ours, you should go to the polls on election day and vote the Democratic ticket. You must be sure and register before tomorrow's deadline. Register tomorrow so that next November the 4th you can go out and vote for Adlai Stevenson of Illinois for President.\nThank you very much.\n[5.] ROME, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 2:40 p.m.)\nI remember stopping here in 1948, and I enjoyed it. I have Senator Lehman with me on the train today, and it is always a privilege to have his company.\nI have also been talking to your Democratic candidates: John Cashmore for the Senate, and Ray Wilson for Congress. They are good Democrats, and they will represent your interests well if you send them to Washington, as I hope you will.\nNow I want to tell you something about our candidate for President--Adlai Stevenson of Illinois. You know that he has been the Governor of Illinois for 4 years now, and he has done a great job. His record shows him to be a real friend of all the everyday plain people--a man who works for them, and protects their interests without fear or favoritism.\nHe is the best new leader to come up in this country since franklin Roosevelt--and like Roosevelt he has had the best experience a man can have for the Presidency by being Governor of a great State.\nHe has had some other experiences, too, which are very valuable and very important to anybody who takes over the Presidential Office in these times. And these things are not so widely known, so today I would like to tell you something about them. I think it is in your interest to know just who Adlai Stevenson is.\nYou may recall that after the fall of France, in 1940, President Roosevelt brought Colonel Stimson into his Cabinet as Secretary of War, and Colonel Knox as Secretary of the Navy. Secretary Knox had known Adlai Stevenson in Chicago, and thought very highly of him. So Stevenson came down to Washington, too, as the Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy. He stayed on that assignment through most of the war, working right beside the Secretary on a great number of top-level policy problems. He learned a great deal about our Government in that period of time, and about the relationships between the civilian authorities and the military. This experience was a good deal like franklin Roosevelt's in World War I. Roosevelt profited enormously by his years in the Navy--and so, I know, did Adlai Stevenson.\nIn the fall of 1943 the Italian Government surrendered to the Allies. We did not hold all of Italy, but the southern part was in our hands. The Germans had left the country in terrible shape, the port of Naples was a total wreck. President Roosevelt got worried about what was to become of the country and the people. So he borrowed Adlai Stevenson from the Navy Department, and sent him to Italy to survey conditions and decide what we ought to do to rehabilitate that great country.\nStevenson went all over Sicily and southern Italy, and got a firsthand picture of the poverty and misery and economic wretchedness in that country. Then he came home and made his report. It was an excellent report--history-making in many ways. For he had grasped clearly in this experience the basic ideas which later came to be known as the Marshall plan.\nStevenson advised us back in early 1944 that temporary relief for the Italian people was essential, but not enough. He pointed out that we would have to move in and help restore essential industry and commerce and lines of trade. Unless we did that, he told us, the Communists might move in and take over. And he advised us to act first, and act fast--in order that Italy might stay free.\nThe American Government did take action, first in Italy and later throughout Western Europe. The Marshall plan itself was a great expansion of the philosophy of action which Stevenson brought back with him from Italy.\nThere is one more aspect of Governor Stevenson's career I want to mention. That is his part in launching the United Nations. As a representative of this country, he took a leading part in working out the organization and procedures of the United Nations, and making it a going concern.\nTwice after that, I appointed him to serve in our delegations to the General Assembly. He did a brilliant job there, too. Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt can testify to that. We would have liked to keep Stevenson in Washington to work full time on foreign problems, but he preferred to go back to Illinois to practice law and get into politics.\nThat was the best decision he ever made-best for himself, best for our country, for that set him on the road to the governorship of Illinois, and to the Presidency of the United States.\nNow, my friends, remember that it's up to you to send Stevenson and Sparkman to Washington as President and Vice President. And you can't do that--you can't vote for him unless you register. So register today or tomorrow if you have not done it before.\nAnd when you go down to the polls to vote on the 4th of November, remember that it is your interests that are at stake. If you vote as you should, you will vote in your interest, you will vote for the welfare of this great Nation of ours, and you will vote for the welfare of the free peoples of the world, because we are the leader of the free peoples of the world--and the President of the United States is the most important figure in that position. You must therefore remember that if you want good government at home, if you want every effort possible made for peace in the world, vote the Democratic ticket on November the 4th.\nThank you very much.\n[6.] UTICA, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 3:20 p.m.)\nIt is grand to be back here in Utica this afternoon. I still remember the reception you gave me up here in the Mohawk Valley 4 years ago, even though it was raining cats and dogs when I was here. You turned out to listen to me, and I appreciated it very much.\nThis year I am out again, campaigning for a Democratic victory in November. I want you to distinctly understand that I am not running for anything.\nYou have some fine men running on the Democratic ticket here in New York State: for the House, Ray Wilson; for Senator, John Cashmore. Those two gentlemen will represent you well, if you will send them down to Washington.\nThis year the Democratic Party has two of its best candidates who have ever run for President and Vice President in Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman. Stevenson is being fought by the same special interest groups and the same lobbyists who have always fought me. That is a compliment to him, too. Governor Stevenson has made it clear that he will not yield to pressure. If you elect him President, you will have a man in the White House who will work for all the people, just as I have tried to do for the last 7 years.\nIt is tremendously important to have a man in the White House who will stand firm for his principles. The President has to make decisions that affect the whole country and the whole world. If he does not have the courage and the intellectual honesty to do what he knows is right, the results can be disastrous for us all.\nThat is why I have been so disturbed, and so deeply distressed at the course the Republican candidate has followed in this campaign. He has betrayed his principles, and he has deserted his friends. Let me tell you a little story to show you what I mean.\nJust a few miles outside of Utica is Hamilton College. It is a fine liberal arts college. One of Hamilton College's most illustrious graduates is Philip C. Jessup. Philip Jessup married a Utica girl, and worked in one of your Utica banks. He later became a distinguished professor of international law at Columbia University.\nI have appointed Ambassador Jessup to some of the most difficult jobs in the public service. He has an honorable record, and has made an outstanding contribution to the cause of world peace. He is a patriot--a fine American; and he has helped his Government immeasurably in fighting world communism.\nWhile Ambassador Jessup was on an overseas assignment aimed at curbing Soviet expansion, he was viciously attacked by Senator McCarthy. That was in 1950--which was not a presidential election year. In that year, the president of Columbia University, who is now the Republican candidate for President of the United States, sprang to Jessup's defense. This is what he wrote in 1950 to Philip Jessup, a member of his own faculty who was being unjustly attacked-and I quote from the General's letter:\n\"No one . . .\"--this is a quotation from General Eisenhower's letter--\"No one who has known you can for a moment question the depth or sincerity of your devotion to the principles of Americanism.\" That is the end of the quote.\nNow the president of Columbia University knew in 1950 that McCarthy's attack was false and without foundation, just as McCarthy's attacks on other loyal public servants have been. If he needed any further proof of the kind of man McCarthy is, he certainly found it in the vile attack McCarthy made on Gen. George C. Marshall.\nGeneral Marshall had been the great friend and benefactor of the Republican candidate. He knew--and he knows today--that General Marshall's patriotism is above question. And he knows the same thing about Phil Jessup.\nThe Republican candidate knows, or he ought to know, how completely dishonest Joe McCarthy is. He ought to despise McCarthy, just as I expected him to--and just as I do.\nNow, in his bid for votes, he has endorsed Joe McCarthy for reelection--and humbly thanked him for riding on his train.\nI can't understand it. I had never thought the man who is now the Republican candidate would stoop so low. I have thought about this a great deal. I don't think I shall ever understand it.\nBut this much is clear to me. A man who betrays his friends in such a fashion is not to be trusted with the great Office of President of the United States.\nNow, my friends, very fortunately we do not have to trust him with the office. Fortunately we have Adlai Stevenson, a man who is worthy of our faith and our trust.\nAnd I urge you--I want to make you a request--I urge you to get the record--the Congressional Record--where the votes of the Republicans in Congress, and the votes of the Democrats in Congress are kept. It is the driest, dullest document in the world, but for your own patriotic welfare and your own patriotic duty you ought to study the records of the men in Congress who are running the Government either one way or the other.\nAnd you will find that the Republicans in Congress have voted against every single one of those forward-looking things which the Democratic administration has put into effect during the last 20 years. You will find that no matter what the Republican presidential candidate may say, he will be a prisoner of the isolationist Republicans--and he can't help himself.\nNow, for your own sake, for your own welfare, for the welfare of the greatest Nation in the history of the world, and for the welfare of the free world, go down to the polls on November the 4th and vote the Democratic ticket--and the country will be safe for another 4 years.\n[7.] AMSTERDAM, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 4:30 p.m.)\nI am happy to be able to stop here this year, just as I did 4 years ago. Only this time I am campaigning not for myself but for the Democratic ticket. You know, I have to explain to these meetings we have been having on this tour around the country, that I am not running for office because they turned out better this time than they ever did before. Maybe that's the reason.\nThere are some very good men on the Democratic ticket here in this great State of New York. I have been riding with most of them all day. I have been informed that David C. Prince is your candidate for Congress, that he is a very able and competent man. I know John Cashmore. I know he will make you a great Senator. And I hope that you will follow Governor Lehman's advice and give him a colleague that will go along with him.\nThe Democratic Party is fortunate to have at the head of its ticket Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman. These two men have proved by their records of public service that they can be trusted with the great responsibilities of leadership in the tough years ahead.\nNow I want to talk to you today about a basic American principle that concerns every one of you--the basic American principle that all men regardless of their race, religion, or national origin have equal rights before the law, and also have equal rights in our economic life. That principle has made us the greatest Nation in the history of the world.\nAnd Amsterdam offers daily proof of the soundness of that principle. Here in this city, people of different national origins live side by side, work together, bring up their children to be fine American citizens.\nBut this principle of equal rights is always under attack. Some people are always trying to cut down the liberties of others or block the progress of racial or national groups different from their own--or more recently settled in this country. They do this because they are selfish and shortsighted. They do not understand that all the different groups in this country have made great contributions to our national progress.\nOne of the worst examples of this situation is the new immigration law--the McCarran Act--that passed the Congress over my veto earlier this year. Our immigration laws are now based on an un-American theory of racial superiority. This theory was written into our immigration laws under a Republican President and a Republican Congress in the 1920's. That theory holds that the socalled Nordics from England and northern Europe are superior to persons born in countries like Italy, Greece, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. And as a result, the law allows many more immigrants from England and north Europe to enter this country, than from southern or eastern Europe.\nThat's the National Origin Quota System. It is a Republican invention, and they are proud of it.\nAfter World War II, we got around this quota system for a while by passing the Displaced Persons Act. And this year the Congress had a chance to get rid of this whole unfair arrangement once and for all. But what happened? The Congress passed a new law which is even more unfair in its discriminations against naturalized citizens and immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. This new law was passed only because the Republicans in the Congress ganged up to support it. I vetoed the bill, but the Republicans in the Senate voted 4 to 1 in favor of it. The bill passed over my veto.\nIt is true the new law bears the name of a Democratic Senator, but I am here to say to you very frankly he's not my kind of a Democrat. My kind of Democrat was fighting against the law, and one of the leaders of that fight was your own Senator Lehman, supported by our vice-presidential candidate, John Sparkman.\nI want you to keep in mind that the President in this case and many others, is the last line of defense against attacks like these. That is why you need a man in the White House for the next 4 years who understands our basic rights and is determined to preserve them.\nThe Republican candidates and the Republican Party cannot be trusted to protect these principles. The Republican candidate for president has said that he has no views on the subject of immigration. The Republican candidate for vice president was one of the Senators who first voted for the new immigration bill, and then voted to override my veto. And the Republican platform does not say one word about the immigration policy of the country.\nThe Democratic platform pledges a fight to rid our law of these unfair restrictions. And Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman stand squarely in support of its promise to revise our immigration laws.\nThat is one of the reasons the people of this country are going to keep the Democratic Party in control of the White House, and send more Democrats to Congress. That is the only way the people can get action on this issue--and all the other issues that affect the daily welfare of all the people of this country.\nNow, you should study the situation. You ought to read the record. You ought to read the record of the great issues that are before the country. The Republicans don't want to discuss issues. They try to sidetrack you, or say foolish things that have not happened. They want to take your mind' off the fact that they have been wrong on every issue where the welfare of the country and the welfare of the people who make the country great are at stake.\nIf you study the record, read the fine print in the Congressional Record--read the votes of the Republicans in the Congress, study the votes of the Democrats in the Congress; and see which party has been coming to the front for the welfare of all the people and not just a few.\nAnd if you do that, I won't have to ask you to make up your mind to vote the Democratic ticket, because you can't help but do it.\nNow, remember on November the 4th that unless you register you can't make up your mind one way or the other. And when you don't do that, you are a slacker--and you don't get a chance to vote. And when you don't vote, you get the kind of government you deserve.\nNow go down there and register. Then on November the 4th go to the polls and vote the Democratic ticket, and you will have 4 more years of good government.\n[8.] SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK (Platform near the station, 5:05 p.m.)\nI thank you very much for that welcome. I have been in Schenectady many times, and I made a farm speech here once in 1935, and you know I found out something while I was here that I didn't know before. They were celebrating the 200th anniversary of the opening of the West, and the opening of the West was the Mohawk Valley. I have told that in California, and they just don't understand how that could happen.\nI inspected your industries here during the war, when I was Chairman of the Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program. I feel quite at home here.\nAs you may have heard, I am out campaigning for victory for the Democrats in November. I am doing that in my capacity as the leader of the Democratic Party. That is one of my jobs as President of the United States.\nYou have some very good Democratic candidates here in New York--your candidate for Congress, David Prince; for Senator, John Cashmore. They are ably qualified to represent you in the Congress.\nIn particular, I urge you to vote the national Democratic ticket--Adlai Stevenson for President and John Sparkman for Vice President. Both of them are men you can trust to work for you and look out for your interests. Their records prove that they are real friends of the workingman, the farmer, and of all the people.\nI have been out to San Francisco and back on this trip, and I have seen a very, very prosperous country. This prosperity we have seems to be driving the Republicans crazy. They can't bear to see the country so well off under the Democrats, so they are doing their best to try to explain it away. They have no issues, so all they can do is just yell about Democratic prosperity.\nThe first thing they say is that the country is not prosperous at all. Then they tell you that even if it is, there is something wrong about it. Then they say it can't last, and of course, they have been saying that ever since 1936. When I read their speeches today, I think of Alf Landon and Wendell Willkie and Dewey and it sounds as if they had written the speeches that are being used by the Republicans today, because they haven't changed a dime's worth.\nNow they are trying to tell you that our prosperity can't last, because they say that the defense effort is the only thing holding up the economy. They are trying to get across the notion that the Democrats don't know how to keep this country prosperous except by spending money on national defense.\nNow this is not true. It is just one more Republican falsehood to scare you and confuse you in this campaign. The truth is that our prosperity is very sound and healthy. Right now we have a total national production of about $340 billion. Defense accounts for less than one-sixth of that output.\nNow get this straight. If it were not for the defense effort, we would be even more prosperous than we are now. The defense effort is making us postpone and put off a lot of things we need, things that would make our country greater and stronger.\nOur population is growing fast. Our cities are growing fast. lust look at your own city here. That means a lot of things to do. We need more houses, better and cheaper houses, more roads, more schools, more hospitals. We need more food and more consumers goods of every kind. Thousands of businessmen are all ready now to expand their plants or build new ones. They see bigger markets ahead. That is a sure sign of good times in the future. In all these ways our peacetime work is piling up on us, and as soon as we can ease off on defense all this work will be waiting for us.\nThat means there need be no depression in this country. And there won't be a depression if you keep the kind of government in Washington that understands these things, and will help get new production going in the right places and at the right time. That is one thing the Democratic Party knows how to do. And we have proved it.\nFor the first time in history, we have kept you out of a depression after a big war. In 1949, when things started to slide back, we took quick action, and by the spring of 1950 we were back in boom times again. That was before Korea started. The defense buildup had nothing whatever to do with it.\nBut the Republicans are right about one thing. There could be a depression. They ought to know. They are experts at bringing them about. The last time they held office, we had two depressions in 12 years--7 million men out of work in 1921, and 14 million men out of work in 1932. And if they would get in again, it would probably be 24 million out of work.\nAnd there isn't a sign in the world that they wouldn't let it happen again. They don't seem to have any notion of how to get prosperity and growth. For 20 years the Republicans have been voting against the Democratic programs for social security and good wages for workers, and against our program for fair prices for farmers--against just about everything else we have been doing to help build the country up.\nUnfortunately their candidate for President is in no position to make them behave any better, even if he wanted to. He has lived the specialized life of a soldier. The Republican candidate has been a fine general, but the Army is all he has ever known in his whole life. You don't learn much in the Army about what workers and farmers need, or what it's like to be out of a job. Now he is surrounded by the Republican Old Guard, and they have taken him into camp completely. He is just a babe in the woods of Senator Taft.\nWhat a combination!--what a combination! That is, a military man who doesn't know anything about civilian problems, in the hands of the reactionaries who speak and work for the banker, the power lobby, the real estate lobby, and all the other special privilege boys.\nI don't think you can take a chance on turning your country over to an outfit like that. You have got to vote in your own interests. Be sure to register before tomorrow's deadline so you can vote.\nYou are the Government. Don't vote for the big business government, or the military government, either. The people in this country are the power in the Government. They control the Government of this country when they exercise their right to vote. And when they do not exercise that right, then if they get bad government, they have nobody to blame but themselves.\nNow I am urging you just to study the record. Study the record of the Republicans in the Congress for the past 10 years. Study the record of the Republicans in the Congress over the past 10 years--or 20, if you want to.\nAnd you will find that the Democratic Party has been on the side of the people every time, and the Republicans have been on the side of the special interests.\nSo, on the 4th of November, go to the polls and vote the Democratic ticket, and keep the country in safe hands for another 4 years.\n[9.] ALBANY, NEW YORK (Trainside, 6 p.m.)\nIt is always good to visit Albany--which is real Democratic country.\nYou have voted Democratic in the presidential elections ever since 1928, and just this past April in a special election you had the good sense to send Leo O'Brien to Congress. He ran on the Democratic record-and he won by a handsome margin. So send him back again.\nI also urge you to send John Cashmore to the Senate. With Leo O'Brien in the House, and John Cashmore in the Senate you will be represented in Washington as you ought to be.\nThe Democratic Party is going to win this November because the people know the record--the dark Republican record of reaction and the bright Democratic record of progress.\nI am making this trip to help in the election of two fine candidates for President and Vice President. These are men who have proved they understand the Democratic Party's role in making this country the great place it is--Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman.\nAnd I am also trying to convince the people that it would be a great mistake to elect the Republican candidate for President.\nThere was a time when I thought the present Republican candidate was qualified to be President. I realized, of course, that he would have trouble in political life, as all military men do. But I thought I could rely on his integrity. I believed he would always stand up for the things he had worked so hard to achieve.\nWhatever else happened, I thought he would defend the international policies that he had done so much in his military career to help create and put into effect. I thought he would stand firmly behind the great defense effort we are making to hold off Communist aggression and prevent world war three. I thought he could be relied on to give firm support to our allies and to the brave men who are struggling against aggression in Korea.\nMy friends, that is not the case, I am sorry to say.\nAt one time he advocated budget cuts in our national defense program more extreme than those advocated by Senator Taft. The size of his proposed cut varies from speech to speech, and I don't know what the quotation is today, but it doesn't make any difference. Everything he has proposed would be a crippling blow to our defense program, and would undo much of the work that is now going forward.\nBy attacking our efforts in Korea and calling them a blunder, he has raised questions that strike a blow at the morale of the free nations fighting there. I never thought I would see a general, least of all this one, doing anything that could weaken the morale and faith of our country in the cause for which we are fighting--at the very time when our troops are locked in battle with the enemy.\nThese and other developments have led me to the firm conclusion that the Republican candidate is not qualified to be President. If he can't withstand the political pressures of a campaign any better than this, he will not be able to withstand the far greater pressures that beat upon a President in office. I have had some experiences with these pressures, and I think I know what I am talking about.\nMy disillusionment with this general has led me to go back and study the role of other generals in our politics, and I have come to the firm conclusion that we should always keep civilians at the head of our Government. I think this was intended by the Constitution. I think history proves that professional generals should not be President.\nWe have had many fine generals in our history. They have been great and able men who have lived a life of real public service. But they can render that service best in the military life for which they were trained.\nMilitary training and military life do not qualify a man to be President.\nA President has to learn about politics and civil government from experience. Only a man who understands politics thoroughly can keep from being imposed on and pushed around, and used as a tool by politicians.\nA man who spends all his life in the Army can't possibly learn the business of political life. He has too much else to do.\nFurthermore, the military life is almost the opposite of political life. A good many of you have been in the Armed forces and know how different army life is. In the Army a general gets things done by giving orders--but that is not the way the Government works. A President can't order the people of the United States around.\nMost good military leaders recognize that their training does not qualify them for the Presidency. Most of them follow the tradition of keeping out of politics.\nOne of our great generals once put this idea very well, in words I shall read to you. He said: \"Politics is a profession--a serious, complicated, and in its true sense, a noble one.\n\"In the American scene I see no dearth of men fitted by training, talent, and integrity for national leadership. On the other hand, nothing in the international or domestic situation especially qualifies for the most important office in the world a man whose adult years have been spent in the country's military forces. At least, this is true in my case.\"\nThat statement, my friends, was made 4 years ago, by the man who is now the Republican candidate for President. It was true then. And it is true today.\nThere is another good reason why professional generals should not become President. One of the basic principles of our Government is that it should be under civilian control. The military arm of government exists to serve the people. It should never rule them. A professional soldier in the White House might give the military undue power in our Government.\nAnother famous general put this danger very wall. He said, and I quote, \"It would be a tragic development indeed, if this generation was forced to look to the rigidity of military dominance and discipline . . . nothing is more conducive to arbitrary rule than the military junta. It might well destroy our historic and wise concept which holds to the supremacy of the civil power .... The gravity of this danger cannot be over estimated.\"\nNow those words were spoken by Gen. Douglas MacArthur. And I certainly agree with him that a civilian President is needed to hold the generals in their proper place in our form of government. And I think I have amply demonstrated that myself.\nOur political history proves that it is a great mistake to send a professional military man to the White House.\nIn all our history, we have elected a purely professional military man to the Presidency only on two occasions.\nWe have elected other men who had fine military records and who had been generals, like Washington and Jackson and Garfield. But they were not Regular Army men; they were civilians first--lawyers or legislators-and soldiers second.\nWe have had only two lifelong Army men in the White House.\nThe first was Zachary Taylor, who had been in the Army for 40 years. He was a hero of the Mexican War. He was inaugurated in 1849, and died a year and a half later, at the age of 65. In his campaign, he made a lot of promises about cleaning up the Government, and doing away with political patronage. After he was elected, he doled out more political jobs than his predecessors, and restored the \"spoils system.\" Instead of cleaning up corruption, he increased it. He was succeeded by a Vice President, Millard Fillmore, who made a very unpopular President, I am sorry to say, because he came from New York.\nThe second and last professional military man elected to the Presidency was General Grant. He had two terms from 1869 to 1877. He gave the country the most corrupt administration it ever had in all its history. He was a fine general, he was personally honest, but a complete failure as President. The politicians led him around by the nose, and got him to give them anything they wanted.\nIn fact, both those generals were babes in the woods when it came to politics. They were set up by the political leaders of the Whig Party and the Republican Party to bamboozle the people. And they used them.\nIt is very interesting to study why and how generals have been chosen as candidates for President. In addition to the two regular generals who were successful, three Regular Army generals have run and been defeated. In almost every case, the general was nominated by a political party that was hopelessly divided into factions, or on the wrong side of the issues.\nPolitical leaders are never willing to let a general have the nomination, if they think their party has a good chance of winning the election on its merits. They want the Presidency for themselves.\nThe politicians nominate generals in the hope that military glamor will fool the people, and keep them from thinking about the issues.\nThere are a lot of examples of this, but I have time only to mention a few.\nThe Whig Party was probably the worst offender in this matter of nominating generals. The Whig Party was the successor of the old Federalist Party, and the ancestor of the Republican Party today. The Whigs were always disunited and divided. They started in the 1820's and about the only thing they could agree on was that they hated Andrew Jackson who was, of course, a Democrat.\nThey were the party that put up Gen. William Henry Harrison in 1840. He was a Regular Army general, but he had also served a good part of his life in civil government. However, he was picked for his reputation as a hero of the wars against the Indians.\nThat was one of the wildest campaigns in our history. That was the \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too\" campaign. The Whigs never talked about a single issue--they didn't even have a platform, and nobody knew where this general stood on anything, except that he was against the Democrats. They bamboozled the people with the general's glamor and a lot of ballyhoo, and he was elected, but he died almost as soon as he was inaugurated.\nIt worked so well in 1840 that the Whigs tried it again in 1848 with Gen. Zachary Taylor. It was the same story then. The Whig Party was hopelessly divided into two factions. They couldn't agree on the issues. And again they had no platform. So they nominated a general who had never cast a vote in his life, and whose views, if he had any, were completely unknown.\nThe Whig Party tried the same stunt in 1852--just a hundred years ago-but by this time the people were beginning to catch on. In that year the Whigs eliminated all the candidates who had ever taken a position on any issue, and nominated another Mexican War hero, Gen. Winfield Scott. He was known as \"Old fuss and feathers.\"\nAnd the Democrats beat the tar out of him.\nAnd that, by the way, was the end of the Whig Party. It fell apart after the election, and soon expired.\nIn 1864 the Democratic Party in the North was in a weak position. They wanted to capitalize on the people's weariness with the Civil War without appearing unpatriotic. So they picked an Army general who hated Lincoln--General McClellan. But he was defeated, and that certainly was a good thing for the country.\nThe Democratic Party in 1864 was a lot like the Republican Party today. The isolationist Republicans now want to make an issue out of Korea and our whole policy of checking Communist aggression, without appearing to be unpatriotic. So they are using a general to front for them.\nThat is the way it goes, all through our history. Whenever you see a Regular general as a party's candidate, you know the politicians in that party are desperate--that the party is so unpopular or so divided they think they can't win without military glamor.\nThat's exactly the situation in the Republican Party today. The Republicans haven't won a national election in 20 years. And I hope they don't win for another 20. Their policies are reactionary and out of step with the people. They can't possibly win on domestic issues. And they are hopelessly divided over foreign policy and very bitter at each other. At their convention they were calling each other thieves and robbers.\nThey are a desperate and divided minority party, who can't go before the people and tell them what they really stand for. So they have used the old trick of desperate politicians and picked a Regular Army general to hide their own miserable record and take the people's minds off the issues.\nIt's an old trick and it isn't going to work this time.\nDon't let them fool you.\nIt's a good thing to study American history. It helps you to understand what is happening, and to avoid getting fooled.\nSo don't fall this year for one of the oldest political tricks in American history.\nIt is your interests that are at stake. You are the Government. The power of government, under our Constitution, lies with the people, and the way to exercise that power is by voting in election time. All of you ought to be registered so you can vote and show what you believe in politics, what you want for your own interests, for the interests of this country, and for the welfare of the whole free world.\nIt is necessary for you to inform yourself on the issues. I have gone across this country from one end of it to the other, and I have told the people where the Democratic Party stands, and what the Democratic Party has done for the country.\nNow the Republicans have not yet stated what they are for. They have only stated that they are against the Democrats. Now, use your judgment. Vote the Democratic ticket on November 4th and the country will be safe for another 4 years.\n[10.] HUDSON, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 6:55 p.m.)\nI appreciate your welcome very much. And you know, another thing I appreciate most highly--I am told that your Republican chairman sent all these people down here so that they could hear a lesson on politics.\nNow the other day I received a letter from the president of your Student Council at your high school here. He tells me that you are going to have a football game here tonight. I am going to read you his letter, and I am going to answer it. He says,\n\"Dear President Truman: It will indeed be a great honor for us when you stop at Hudson on October 10. It is not often that\"\nI shouldn't say this--\n\"--a great man such as you stops at our small city. Writing as a representative of Hudson High I know it would be greatly appreciated by the students if in some way you could mention the football game which will be played on the Athletic field of Hudson High. Our opponent will be Columbia High School, and the game will start at 8:00 p.m.\"\nWait--wait--the plug hasn't come yet. \"Since the turnout at our game has been small, this certainly would stir up the spirit for our team. I realize that you have many worthwhile things to say, and a short time in which to say them, and probably it would be difficult for you to mention the football game. Once again I would like to thank you for your plans to stop at Hudson.\"\nNow here is what I am going to tell him. I wish I could stay and see that game, but I am in a very embarrassing position, because it would be impossible for me to take sides. You see, I am out on a political campaign.\nThis is an election year, and I don't want to make anybody mad, unless there is some good reason for it. There is one thing I would like to make a lot of people mad about, and I have good reason for that. I would like to make people mad about the way the Republicans are insulting your intelligence in this election campaign.\nNow Governor Stevenson has been telling you about the kind of campaign the Republicans are putting on--and so have I. There are a lot of people who won't believe what we tell them about this. They think we are a little prejudiced. So today I want to read you something from another source. If this one is prejudiced at all, it is certainly not in our favor.\nThis is the Wall Street Journal for Friday, September 12. I have it right here. The headline says: \"A GOP Gamble. Ike's Tacticians Plan To Keep His Talk Vague. They Rely on His Popularity. It's the Old Dewey Pattern With the Big Difference, a Hero Candidate. Appeals to the Ladies and the Kids.\"\nThen the story says, \"The vagueness of Candidate Eisenhower's campaign pronouncements thus far is no accident--nor is it merely a preliminary phase of the General's plan for winning. It's part of a campaign strategy which his aides aim to continue until election day . . .\"\nThen a little further down the story goes on: \"Mr. Eisenhower's campaign planners are well aware of the risk in failing to get down to brass tacks with the voters. They remember\"--now this is the Wall Street Journal--\"and indeed some of them helped mastermind, the ill-fated campaign of New York's Governor Dewey in 1948. Critics agree that Mr. Dewey's generalities were a big factor in his defeat. But those who are counseling a similar course for Ike take pains to contend that 'Dewey didn't have what the General has--a tremendous reservoir of good will.'\"\n\"Furthermore,\" says the Wall Street Journal, \"Mr. Eisenhower's strategy is dictated as much by necessity as by choice, his advisers agree. Even Ike's most ardent admirers say he simply doesn't know enough about the home front to joust with Mr. Stevenson\"--\n--or Mr. Truman--\n--\"on many specific issues. 'The General couldn't even pretend to know the answers,' one of his brain trusters asserts . . . They are. . . relying heavily on nothing more than the General's impact on the people. Especially the Ike men are pitching their campaign at two big segments of the voting population, the youth and the ladies. The General rarely fails to mention both in his campaign talks.\"\nNow that's the end of the quotation from the Wall Street Journal. This is not prejudiced in my favor, I can tell you. And that is not the worst part of the story about the Republican campaign. Even the Wall Street Journal wouldn't tell you the whole story about how the special interest lobbies control the Republican Party. But I think I read enough to show why you ought to be insulted.\nYou know, the General said he was going to win this election by appealing to the emotions of the voters, and not to their reason. He is not going to talk to you about the issues. Why? This article quotes one of the brain trusters as saying, \"The General couldn't even pretend to know the answers.\" I agree with that. And I don't think that is the kind of man we ought to have for President.\nThese are critical times, my friends, and the Office of the President of the United States is the most important job in the world. This is one place where we need a man who does know the answers.\nI am proud to say that the Democratic Party offers you a candidate who is that kind of man--Mr. Stevenson. If you have been listening to his speeches, you know that he has a broad grasp of the problems we face today, and a deep understanding of our political institutions.\nI am urging you--particularly you people here who have the right to vote--to study the issues in this campaign. I want you to study the record. And you have got to get that record out of the Congressional Record, where the Congressmen--Republicans and Democrats--in the Congress fix the policies of the party that is in power. It doesn't do any good to listen to a lot of oratorical hooey unless you know what is being said--unless you know what they are talking about. In order to find that out, you have got to read the record, to see just exactly who has been on the side of the people, and who has not.\nNow you young people who are here tonight ought to inform yourselves on government. You ought to do the best you can to find out just exactly what this great Republic means to you. You are the future men and women who will run this country, you young people. I am urging you to get the information that will do you the most good, and make good citizens out of you.\nAnd when you do that, you will find that there is one party in this country that is for progress, for looking ahead.\nThere is one party in this country that wants to turn the clock back to 1896. Now you young people can't go back to 1896. Some of you don't even know who was President in 1896.\nSo I advise you to get your information that will do you the most good. Look to your own interests, and look to the future of this great Nation--the greatest free nation in the history of the world. There never was a nation equal to this one.\nThis Nation, my friends, is the leader of the free world. We must have people who are looking forward, and not people who are looking back.\nNow, if that really is what you want, you ought to register and be sure you are on the books--all of you who can vote. And then go to the polls and vote for the man that is taking us forward, not one who doesn't know what the issues are--who is turning the clock back. I urge you in your own interests, go to the polls on the 4th of November, and vote the Democratic ticket.\nThank you very much.\n[11.] YONKERS, NEW YORK (Near the train, 9:12 p.m.)\nI am very glad to be here tonight. I guess you know why I am here. I am out campaigning for the Democratic ticket, and I have had a good visit with your great Senator Lehman. He gives you the right kind of representation in the Congress. I hope you will send John Cashmore to help him out and to work with Senator Lehman.\nAnd I hope you will send the two able Congressmen to the Congress who will be for the people, and not for the special interests.\nI hope every one of you will vote for our next President--Adlai Stevenson of Illinois. Adlai Stevenson is the finest young leader to come along since franklin Roosevelt saved the country back in 1933. Like Roosevelt, you can count on him to understand your problems and to work for you. He is a man you can trust.\nI have been traveling for nearly 2 weeks now, and I have made more speeches than I can count. And every place I have gone, I have tried to explain to the people what we will all be up against if the Republicans win this election--and God save us from that.\nI have told them, and I will tell you, if the Republicans succeed in grabbing off the Congress and the White House, you will be saddled with a government you can't trust. The Republicans cannot be trusted with the prosperity of this country. They cannot be trusted with the peace of the world, and that is much more important to you young people.\nNow, those are strong statements, and I know it. I wouldn't make them if I couldn't back them up. But it happens that they are true. And I will tell you exactly why they are true.\nIn the first place, you can't trust the Republicans because they don't represent you, and they won't work for you. The Republican Party is not a party of the plain, everyday people in this country. Instead, it is the roosting place of the big powerful lobbies and the special interest groups. The big banks, the power companies, the oil companies, the real estate lobby--and worst of all the China lobby, and the rest of that crew--they are the people who foot the bills for the Republican Party.\nThey pay their money--and they give their orders. They want service in return-and they get it. And they are the only ones who do. The people do not get it.\nIn our country it has become the function of the Democratic Party to represent the people. With us, the people come first.\nWith the Republicans, property and profits come first--way ahead of the people.\nNow what I say is proved by the Republican record in the Congress. It is an Old Guard record, for the Old Guard controls the party with an iron fist. It is a most reactionary record. It is even further right than Bob Taft--and that is saying a lot.\nThe record shows that a great majority of the Republicans in Congress have voted time after time against social security, against minimum wages, against the Wagner Act, the housing laws--they have voted to hamstring almost all our programs of foreign aid to help build up the strength of this free world.\nAnd what have they voted for? Well, they have voted for tax loopholes for the rich. They have voted to curb unions through the Taft-Hartley law. They have voted to riddle and ruin our price controls and rent controls. They have voted to give away our offshore oil, in which you have a very deep interest, to raise the price of natural gas, and every other kind of special favor for their lobby friends.\nIf you would like a good example of how they vote the way the lobbies want, I urge you to look at the record of their vice-presidential candidate. You have heard something about--my friends, you have heard something about his personal finances, but his voting record is even worse than that-and there aren't very many things that could be worse.\nAs for their presidential candidate, he has shown in recent weeks that while he was a good general, as a politician he is just another Old Guard Republican.\nNow, ever since that famous breakfast with Senator Taft, the Old Guard has had him surrounded and tied down. In fact, they have had him hog-tied. What is more, he doesn't seem to mind it at all. He actually seems to be more comfortable than when he had the company of Tom Dewey and the other so-called liberal Republicans.\nNow, my friends, there was a time when I thought the General might make a good President, but his activities in this campaign have shown me that I was entirely wrong. I made a mistake, but I don't want you to make that same mistake. I don't want you to saddle yourselves with big business government, or military government, either. I don't want to see our country in the hands of a military man who is surrounded and controlled by the worst clements in the Old Guard Republican Party.\nDon't fall for this. Don't vote for him. Vote your own interests. You, the people, control this country when you exercise the right of franchise. You are the Government, and the power in this Government is placed in your hands by the greatest document of government that was ever written--the Constitution of the United States. It gives you the right to say the kind of government you may have. And if you don't exercise that privilege, if you let election day go by without doing your duty as a patriotic citizen by going to vote, and you get bad government, and you get imposed upon by those who are in the Government, you have got nobody to blame but yourselves.\nI have been from one end of the country to the other and I have explained to the people just exactly what their rights are, just exactly what they have to do to maintain those rights. And I think they understand exactly what the situation is with which we are faced.\nI can't get the Republicans to come out and say what they are for. I can't get them to say what sort of government they would like to see in this country. All I can hear from them are smears and boos and attacks when I tell the truth on them. And that hurts a lot worse than if I give them hell-as a lot of people want me to do.\nThey just simply can't stand the facts and the truth. All you have to do is to read the record--some of which I have pointed out to you this evening.\nGo now--inform yourselves. I am not trying to influence you one way or the other. I want you to vote in your own best interests. And if you inform yourselves, you can't do anything else but vote for the welfare of this great Nation.\nVote for the welfare of the free nations of this world. Vote for your own private interests. And if you do that, you will vote the Democratic ticket on election day--and the country will be safe for another 4 years.\n[12.] NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK (Grand Central Station, 10:30 p.m.)\nI am overwhelmed. I am overwhelmed. I can't tell you how very much I appreciate this meeting. I appreciate more than I can tell you what you have done tonight. No man--no man in the world could deserve what you have done here this evening.\nI have been from one end of the United States to the other, trying to outline what I think is for the welfare of this great Nation of ours. I have been in public office--elective office--for more than 30 years, and I have had that happen to me through the offices of the Democratic Party.\nOn January 20th I shall come to the end of my term as President of the United States--the highest office in the history of the world.\nAnd I am trying to show to you what I feel--how grateful I am. The Democratic Party has been exceedingly kind to me. I appreciate what they have done for me.\nNo man in the history of the country has had the experience that I have had. I have gone from precinct to President. No other man in the history of the country has done that. And I am not like these people who accept everything in the world from the party, and then when they arrive at the top want to turn around and become so-called independents and not work for the welfare of the people that have elevated them. I am not that sort.\nI believe, my friends, that we are faced with the most important election in the history of the country. I am hoping that every single one of you will inform himself on exactly what the issues are. I have stated the issues from the Democratic standpoint, and I am trying to force the Republicans to state their issues--and I don't believe they have any.\nWhenever the people know what the facts are, when they know what is best for the country, when they know what is best for their own welfare, I am not worried at all about what they will do.\nAll I am trying to do is to get you to inform yourselves on the facts. You will have a hard time getting any facts from the Republicans-but you can get all you want from me.\nNow, my friends, if you will inform yourselves on the situation as it is, you can't do but one thing on the 4th day of November. If you want to do what is best for yourselves, what is best for the Nation, and what is best for the free world, you will go to the polls on November the 4th, and you will vote the Democratic ticket, and the country will be safe for another 4 years.\nNOTE: In the course of his remarks on October 10 the President referred to John Cashmore, Democratic candidate for Senator, Senator Herbert It. Lehman, O. Richard Judson, Victor Kruppenbacher, Arthur B. McGuire, Dr. Charles R. Wilson, and David C. Prince, Democratic candidates for Representative, Mayor Thomas J. Corcoran of Syracuse, and Representative Leo W. O'Brien, all of New York. The President also referred to Governor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, Democratic candidate for President, Senator John Sparkman of Alabama, Democratic candidate for Vice President, Senators Robert A. Taft of Ohio, William E. Jenner of Indiana, and Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, Henry L. Stimson, former Secretary of War, frank Knox, former Secretary of the Navy, Philip C. Jessup, United States Ambassador at Large, and General of the Army George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army, 1939-1945.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] Wow. Well, thank you very much, everybody. Wow. We've all been through a lot together, and we probably deserve that hand for all of us, because it's been a very unfair situation.\nI invited some of our very good friends. And we have limited room, but everybody wanted to come. We kept it down to a minimum. And believe it or not, this is a minimum.\nBut a tremendous thing was done over the last number of months, but really, if you go back to it, over the last number of years. We had the witch hunt. It started from the day we came down the elevator, myself and our future First Lady, who's with us right now. Thank you, Melania. [Applause] Stand up.\nAnd it never really stopped. We've been going through this now for over 3 years. It was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. And this should never, ever happen to another President—ever. I don't know that other Presidents would have been able to take it. Some people said, no, they wouldn't have. But I can tell you, at a minimum, you have to focus on this, because it can get away very quickly. No matter who you have with you, it can get away very quickly. It was a disgrace.\nHad I not fired James Comey—who was a disaster, by the way—it's possible I wouldn't even be standing here right now. We caught him in the act. Dirty cops. Bad people. If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already. Many, many years.\nI want to start by thanking some of—and I call them friends, because, you know, you develop friendships and relationships when you're in battle and war, much more so than, \"Gee, let's have a normal situation.\"\nWith all that we've gone through, we've done, I think, more than any President and administration, and really, I say, for the most part, Republican Congressmen, Congresswomen, and Republican Senators. We've done more than any administration in the first few years; you look at all of the things we've done.\nI watched this morning as they tried to take credit for the stock market from—[laughter]—from—think of that. Let me tell you, if we didn't win, the stock market would have crashed. And the market was going up a lot before the election, because it was looking we had a good chance to win, and then it went up tremendously from the time we won the election until the time we took office, which was November 8 to January 20. And that's our credit. That's all our credit. And leading up to that point was our credit, because there was hope.\nAnd one of the reasons the stock market has gone up so much in the last few days is, people think we're doing so well. They liked the State of the Union speech. It really is—it's a true honor to give it.\nMaking the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around; they've been all over the world. And one of them said—highly sophisticated person—said, \"You know, no matter where you go in the world, it doesn't make any difference—there is nothing like what I witnessed tonight.\" The beauty, the majesty of the Chamber. The power of the United States, the power of the people in this room. Really, an amazing—I don't think there is anything like that anywhere in the world. You can go to any other country, you can go to any other location, any other place. It's the beauty of everything. It's what it represents and how it represents our country.\nI want to start by introducing some of the people that are here. I know some are going to be left out. But they worked so hard. And this is really not a news conference. It's not a speech. It's not anything. It's just, we're sort of—it's a celebration, because we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell, unfairly. Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong. I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit. [Laughter] Not purposely, but I've done things wrong. But this is what the end result is.\n[At this point, the President held up the front page of the Washington Post newspaper displaying the headline \"Trump acquitted.\"]\nSo we can take that home, honey. Maybe we'll frame it. [Laughter] It's the only good headline I've ever had in the Washington Post, I'll tell you. [Laughter] But every paper is the same. Does anybody have those papers? Does anybody have them? Because they're really like that. So I appreciate that.\nBut some of the people here have been incredible warriors. They're warriors. And there's nothing, from a legal standpoint—this is a political thing. And every time, I'd say: \"This is unfair. Let's go to court.\" They'd say: \"Sir, you can't go to court. This is politics.\" And we were treated unbelievably unfairly.\nAnd you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit. [Laughter] We then went through the Mueller report. And they should have come back 1 day later. They didn't. They came back 2 years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money. People came to Washington to help other people. \"Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,\" I say. They came—one or two or three people in particular, but many people.\nWe had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it. [Laughter] It was a nasty—both in the primaries and in the election. But you see, we thought, after the election, it would stop. But it didn't stop; it just started. And tremendous corruption. Tremendous corruption.\nSo we had a campaign. Little did we know we were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers, with all of these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all about it. The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. It's a very tough thing. And then, we ended up winning on Russia, Russia, Russia. It should have taken the 1 day, as I said, and it took years.\nThen, Bob Mueller testified. That didn't work out so well for the other side. [Laughter] But they should have said, that first week—because it came out. Is that right, Jim Jordan? They knew in the first 2 days actually. Devin, is that right? Two days. They knew that we were totally innocent.\nBut they kept it going, Mark. They kept it going forever because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that had just won an election that, to—a lot of people were surprised. I mean, we had polls that said we were going to win. We had Los Angeles Times and a few papers, actually, said it was—we were going to win but it was going to be close.\nAnd we did win. It was one of the greatest wins of all time. And they said, \"Okay, he won.\" And you know, I wrote this down, because that was where a thing called the \"insurance policy\"—to me, when I saw the insurance policy—and that was done long before the election. That was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nAnd by the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for millions—millions of dollars—the fake dossier. And now Christopher Steele admits that it's a fake, because he got sued by rich people. I should have sued him too. But when you're President, people don't like suing.\nI want to thank my legal team, by the way, not for that advice, but for other advice. Pat, Jay. Pat. You guys stand up, please. Great job. Right at the beginning, they said: \"Sir, you have nothing to worry about. All of the facts are on your side.\" I said: \"You don't understand. That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter.\" And that was really true.\nThey made up facts. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian President. He brought it out of thin air. Just made it up. They say he's a screenwriter—a failed screenwriter. He tried to go into—unfortunately, he went into politics after that. [Laughter] Remember he said the statement, which is a mob statement: \"Don't call me. I'll call you.\" I didn't say that.\nFortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts. We had transcribers—professional transcribers. Then they said, \"Oh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct.\" But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother—right?—we had some people that—really amazing. But we did everything. We said, \"What's wrong with it?\" \"Well, they didn't add this word or that one.\" It didn't matter. I said: \"Add it. They're probably wrong, but add it.\"\nSo now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. When you read those transcripts, Tim Scott—I don't know if Tim is here, but he said, \"Sir\"—he was the first one to call me. \"Sir, I read the transcript. You did nothing wrong.\" And, Mitch, he stayed there, right from the beginning. He never changed.\nAnd, Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you: You did a fantastic job. Somebody said, \"You know, Mitch is quiet.\" [Laughter] I said: \"He's not quiet. He's not quiet.\" These are the—he doesn't want people to know him. And they said, \"Is Mitch smart?\" I said, \"Well, let's put it this way: For many, many years, a lot of very smart—bad, in many cases, sometimes good—but people have been trying to take his place. And to the best of my knowledge, I've never even heard the subject come up, because they've been wiped out so fast. [Laughter] This guy is great, and I appreciate it, Mitch.\nAnd he's also given us 191 now. A hundred and ninety-one Federal judges. Two Supreme Court judges, right? We're up to 191. [Applause] True.\nGreat guy. Great guy. He's a tough guy to read. I'm good at reading people. A tough guy to read. I'd call him. My wife would say, \"How did you do with Mitch?\" \"Uh, I don't know.\" [Laughter] That's what makes him good—when you can read somebody. Fantastic job.\nAnd he understood, right from the—this was crooked politics. This was crooked politics. How about all these people, they're running for office. They're saying the worst things about me, like eight Senators on the Democrat side. Most of them got wiped out. You know, they got their 1 percent or less. Most of them got less. They decided to go home. \"Let's go back to California.\" Let's go back to wherever they came from. \"Let's go back to New York.\"\nHow about that one? Our New York Senator, Gillibrand. \"Let's go back to New York,\" after they get nothing. And then, they take an oath that they will be fair, that they will be reasonable—and all of the different things. And they had to sign. They're not fair.\nBut here's the beauty: So we have four left. They're saying the most horrendous things about me. It's okay, it's politics. And then, they're supposed to vote on me. They're trying to replace me, and then they're supposed to be voting. So I think it's—I mean, I think it's incredible. But—so, Mitch, I want to thank you very much. Incredible. And you have some of your folks here, and they're incredible people—and they've been, right from the beginning.\nAnd, again, you're out of session. Unfortunately, I didn't—you know, I only told these folks, \"Let's do this today.\" We did a prayer breakfast this morning, and I thought that was really good. In fact, that was so good, it might wipe this out. But by the end—by the time we finished this, we'll wipe that one out—those statements. [Laughter]\nI had—I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I'm saying things that a lot of people wouldn't have said—[laughter]—but I meant every—[laughter]—I meant every word of it.\nBut we have some of the folks that are going to be leaving right after this, and they work hard—and they did work hard. Bill Cassidy, Senator. Stand up, Bill. What a guy. Great man. When I need to know about health insurance and preexisting conditions and individual mandates, I call Bill, or I call Barrasso. We get those two guys; they know more than anybody.\nA man who just became a Senator—he's a little bit like me; we have a couple of them. A very successful guy in business, and he said, \"What the hell, I'll run for the Senate\"—from Indiana. And he ran. And I saw him on television, destroying his opponent in a debate. I said, \"You know, this guy could win.\" And I got behind him. And, Mike Braun, you have done some great job. Thank you very much. Tough. Tough. Thank you.\nA man who got James Comey to choke, and he was just talking in his regular voice. [Laughter] He is the roughest man. He's actually an unbelievable—and I appreciate the letter you sent me today. I just got it. But he's got this voice that scares people. [Laughter] You know, people from Iowa can be very tough. We're doing very well in Iowa.\nBut I'll tell you, Chuck Grassley—he's looking at Comey: \"Well, you tell me, what did you say?\" [Laughter] Now, he wasn't being rough. That was just the way he talked. [Laughter] And that was when Comey—I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying, and everything else, right? He choked, because he never heard anybody talk like that. [Laughter]\nYou know, you should have gone—I wish you got angry. You could have gotten the whole ballgame. He would have said, \"I give up.\" [Laughter] Chuck Grassley is an incredible guy.\nAnd a man who—you know, he was running against a tough, smart campaign, and we learned how good she was, right? She was a great campaigner. In fact, by the end of the campaign, she was actually—I thought she was more for me than you were, Josh. I was worried. [Laughter] I saw her ad; she was saying the greatest things about me. And you know who I'm talking about.\nAnd I went to a great place—Missouri—and I said, \"Who do you have to beat her?\" And they said, \"Well, we have four people.\" I said: \"Let me see them. I'm got to interview\"—can you imagine? I'm interviewing people for the United States Senate. This is what I do. Where have I gone? [Laughter] But I love it. I love it because we're getting great people.\nThe first one I met was Josh Hawley. After about 10 minutes, I said to the people, \"Don't show me anybody else. This is the guy.\" He was the attorney general. Did a phenomenal job in the State. Highly respected. And—Claire McCaskill.\nSo the theory was you couldn't beat her. Great campaigner. Remember the last campaign, she was going to be taken—she was always going to be taken out, then she wins, and people say, \"How did that happen?\" Didn't happen with him.\nBut she got so friendly toward me. In fact, one of the ads I still have. I'm putting it in the archives as one of the best ads I've ever made. [Laughter] And she tried to convince people that we were best friends. But Josh ended up winning by 5 or 6 points. You were unbelievable. You were tough. And you are something. And one of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh Hawley. He was incensed actually; I watched it. He was incensed at what they were doing and what they were saying.\nAnd those were the ones—you know, I had some that said, \"Oh, I wish you didn't make the call.\" And that's okay, if they need that. It's incorrect. It's totally incorrect. And then, you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. An article written today: \"Never heard him use it before.\" But today, you know, it's one of those things. But you know, it's a failed Presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for President.\nBut, Josh Hawley, I want to thank you. You were right from the beginning. Man, did I make a good choice. [Applause] Okay? Thank you, Josh. Tremendous future. A man who is brilliant and who actually was deceived, to an extent, comes from a great State, Utah, where my poll numbers have gone through the roof. And one of the Senators' poll numbers, and not this one, went down big. You saw that. You saw that, Mike?\nBut Mike Lee is a brilliant guy. He's difficult. [Laughter] Whenever I sign bills—you know, we do sign a lot of legislation that's—it's big and it's powerful, but it's sort of everybody has to approve it. And I see 99 to 1—[laughter]—99 to 1. I say, \"Don't tell me who's the one.\" [Laughter] \"Is it Mike?\" \"Yes.\" [Laughter] And he always has a good reason for it too, by the way. But he is, he's incredible. And right at the beginning, he knew we were right, Mike, and I appreciate it very much. You're just fantastic. And say hello to the people of Utah and tell them: \"I'm sorry about Mitt Romney. I'm sorry.\" [Laughter] Okay?\nWe can say that Mike Lee is, by far, the most popular Senator from the State. But you've done a fantastic job, Mike, I—in many ways. In many ways.\nA young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's been so supportive—and I've had great support from other people in that State. And she's been so supportive, and she's been downright nasty and mean about the unfairness to the President. And Kelly Loeffler, I appreciate very much. Thank you. Great.\nShe saw it very early on, and we have—I don't know if we have other Senators here, but we've got a hell of a lot of Congressmen. And I'll go over them quickly, but they have—they have also been—you know, it helped when we won 197 to nothing. That's got to be a first, Kevin. Right? Is that, like, a first?\nThe Republicans have this image. See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians, because they have lousy policy: open borders, sanctuary cities. They have horrible policy. Who the hell can win? Oh, their new policy is: Raise taxes. They want to raise taxes. You know, all my life, I wasn't in politics, but I'd say, if you're a politician, you want to say, \"We're going to lower taxes.\" They want to raise taxes.\nSo they have open borders, sanctuary cities. \"Raise everybody's taxes. Get rid of everybody's health care.\" A hundred and eighty million people in the United States. And they're really happy. \"And we're going to give you a health care that's going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really does well.\" That's 1 year.\nSo I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they do two things: They are vicious and mean. Vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago. When she said, \"I pray for the President. I pray for the\"—she doesn't pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite. [Laughter] But I doubt she prays at all.\nAnd these are vicious people, but they do two things: They stick together, historically. I'm not talking now. They stick together like glue. That's how they impeached, because they had whatever the number is—220 people. So if they don't lose anybody, they'll be able to impeach anybody. You could be George Washington. You could have just won the war, and they say, \"Let's get him out of office.\" And they stuck together, and they're vicious as hell. And they'll probably come back for more, but maybe not because the Republican Party's poll numbers, Mitch, have now gone up more than any time, I think, since 2004, 2005, and you know what happened then.\nBut in normal times—decades, you would call it; that was a little unusual time; it was for a very short period—the Republicans' Party—Party's poll numbers and Donald Trump's poll numbers are the highest I've ever had them. So maybe they were. It's no way to get your poll numbers up. It's not worth it, because from my family's standpoint, it's been very unfair for my family. It's been very unfair to the country.\nThink of it. A phone call. A very good phone call. I know bad phone calls. This is a phone call with many people. I think Mike Pompeo was probably on the call. Where is Mike? Mike Pompeo was on the call. Many people were on the call. I know there were many people. They even have \"apprenti,\" bringing up an old favorite word of mine. \"The Apprentice.\" They have \"apprenti.\" They have people on these calls. And I know there are many.\nWhen I speak to the head of a nation—and they have many people on. I mean, also on—do you think they just—in the case of Ukraine, he's a new President, seems like a very nice person, by the way. His whole thing was corruption. He's going to stop corruption. We even have a treaty—2001, 1999. It's a treaty—signed treaty—that we will work together to root out corruption in Ukraine.\nI probably have a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption. But they don't think it's corrupt when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at all, is working for $3 million up front, $83,000 a month. And that's only Ukraine. Then goes to China, picks up $1½ billion, then goes to Romania, I hear, and many other countries.\nThey think that's okay? Because if it is—is Ivanka in the audience? Is Ivanka here? Boy, my kids could make a fortune. [Laughter] They could make a fortune. It's corrupt. But it's not even that; it's just general corruption.\nAnd the other thing, as mentioned in the call and something that I've told Mike Pence, our great Vice President—I would tell him all the time, and I told him when he went on the trip, because he was over there. He never mentioned anything about this when you had your meeting. It's a terrible thing.\nBut I told Mike. I said: \"Mike, we're giving them money, and you know, you're always torn about that, because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. But we're giving them money. Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying them money?\" Is that a correct statement, Mike?\nI say, \"Find out what the hell is going on.\" And I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said—I asked that question: \"How much is Germany paying? Why isn't Germany paying?\" Why is the United States always the sucker? Because we're a bunch of suckers. But that's turning around fast. But it makes it harder when stuff like this happens, because you want to focus, and you want to focus perfectly.\nThink what we could have done if the same energy was put into infrastructure, prescription drug prices. Think of what we could have done. And I'm now talking both sides. Think of what we could have done if we had the same genius—because it's genius. I will say, it's genius on the other side—maybe even more so—because they took nothing and brought me to a final vote of impeachment. That's a very ugly word to me. It's a very dark word. Very ugly. They took nothing. They took a phone call that was a totally appropriate call. I call it a \"perfect call,\" because it was. And they brought me to the final stages of impeachment.\nBut now we have that gorgeous word—I never thought a word would sound so good. It's called \"total acquittal.\" [Applause] Total acquittal.\nSo I want to, if I could, real fast, just introduce a few of the people. I have to start with—I have to start with Kevin. Man, did you do a job. Lucky you're there. Lucky you're there, because it wouldn't have worked out. If you don't have the right people—I'll tell you, Kevin McCarthy has done an incredible job. [Applause] Really. Stand up.\nAnd he loves this job, and he loves this country. I'll tell you what: Mitch and Kevin, they love what they do. Now, Mitch wouldn't even tell you he liked it. [Laughter] I'd say, \"Mitch, do you like it?\" \"Um, I don't know.\" [Laughter] It's—he's the greatest poker player, right?\nKevin will say, \"I love it.\" Right? And I will say that you're going to be Speaker of the House because of this impeachment hoax. I really believe it. I really believe it. And I'm going to work hard on it. I'm going to try and get out to those Trump areas that we won by a lot.\nAnd you know, in '18, we didn't win. We just won two seats in North Carolina—two wonderful seats in North Carolina—that were not supposed to be won. But I went and I made speeches, and we had rallies, and we did a great job, and we won. We took two seats. Nobody writes about that. If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year.\nBut we're going to go, we're going to do a job, and we're going to win a lot of seats. We're going to win a lot of seats. People are very angry that Nancy Pelosi and all of these guys—I mean, Nadler—I know him much of my life; he's fought me in New York for 25 years. I always beat him. And I had to beat him another time. And I'll probably have to beat him again. [Laughter] Because if they find that I happen to walk across the street and maybe go against the light or something, \"Let's impeach him.\" [Laughter]\nSo we'll probably have to do it again, because these people have gone stone-cold crazy. But I've beaten them all my life, and I'll beat them again if I have to. But what they're doing is very unfair. Very unfair.\nSo Kevin McCarthy has been great. So, a few names, right? And there'll be a few you forget. If you want, you can raise, and I'll say: \"Great. Love to have you. Wonderful.\" [Laughter] But we're going to do the best we can. And I have my Cabinet, but my Cabinet is different—I appoint them. Okay? I didn't see all of them helping so much. [Laughter] You know, they were running their various bureaucracies, right? [Laughter] No, my Cabinet is great, and they're all here.\nBut today is the day to celebrate these great warriors, right? These are great warriors. They really fought hard for us. And—so I'll start: Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota. Kelly, thank you. Great job. Great job. Jim Banks of Indiana. Jim, thank you. Great job. Andy Biggs. Where is Andy? Boy, oh, boy, Andy. He got—there's a guy. He's tough. I hear we're doing well in Arizona, huh? It's going good, yes? I think so. I think I saw a poll that was very good—for me. [Laughter] I think we have to make sure Martha is going to do—I think Martha is going to do good. But we have some States that are going to be not easy, but Arizona has been great.\nAnd we're stopping illegal aliens from coming in. We're putting up walls. New Mexico too, a State that's never been in play for Republicans, is totally in play. Right? Nevada is really looking good. We're doing well. We're doing well. We're going to have a great—there's more spirit. I will say this: There's more spirit now for the Republican Party, by far, than the Democrats. You know, Mike Pence just got back from a place—a beautiful place that Chuck Grassley knows well: Iowa. And he was talking about these fiasco—the Democrats, they can't count some simple votes, and yet they want to take over your health care system. Think of that. [Laughter] No, think of that.\nBut we also had an election out there, and we got 98 percent of the vote. We have two people running, you know, and I guess they consider them nonpeople, but they are running. I mean, one was a Governor. One was a Congressman. They're running. We got 98 percent of the vote.\nAnd everybody from the media was saying, \"Who are those crowds over there?\" You know, they expect it to be one of these competitive—where everybody is running because they want to win, they want to win. And it was Trump. Right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd.\nAnd a lot of—actually, a lot of my guys went there. They went to Iowa. And a lot of friends went there, and we had tremendous—they say the spirit—the spirit for the Republican Party right now is stronger, I think, than it's ever been in the history of our country. I think it's stronger than it's ever been.\nAnd that includes Honest Abe Lincoln. You know, a lot of people forget Abe Lincoln. I wish he were here. I'd give him one hell of an introduction. Right? [Laughter] But he was—he was a Republican. Abe Lincoln. Honest Abe.\nBradley Byrne, Alabama. What a great place. Thank you, Bradley. A man who has been an unbelievable friend of mine and spokesman, and somebody that—that I really like. And I know, Kelly, you're going to end up liking him a lot. Something is going to happen that's going to be very good. [Laughter] I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. But Doug Collins—where is he? Where is Doug? You have been so great. Thank you very much, Doug. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Really an amazing job.\nA young man who is—born with a great gene, because I know his father and how great a politician he was. But he's from Florida. Sometimes controversial, but actually, he's not controversial. He's solid as a rock, and he's a friend of mine. Matt Gaetz. Matt? Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Great job.\nAll right, this guy. So he's the NCAA—meaning, a couple of years ago, when he was in college—wrestling champion, NCAA. That's the big deal. That means, in all of college, you're the champ, you're the best. His record was ridiculous. Nobody would—nobody could beat him. And I see it. You know, every time, I see it. When I first got to know him—Jim Jordan—when I first got to know Jim, I said: \"Huh, he never wears a jacket. What the hell is going on?\" [Laughter] He's obviously very proud of his body. [Laughter]\nAnd they say where he works out—you know, where the Congressmen, Senators, they work out—they say, when Jim works out—even though he's not as young as he was, but they—he works out—the machine starts burning. You know, it's just a different form of a workout than us. Right, Sonny? And—there he is. Look at that guy.\nBut one day I'm looking, and he looks tough. And I'm looking, and I'm looking at those ears. And I say, \"Those ears have something going on there.\" I said, \"Did you ever wrestle?\" \"Yes, I did.\" But he doesn't talk. But I checked. This guy was a world—this guy was a champion, top, top wrestler. And when I had the top—I had all of the teams.\nAnd by the way, your Super Bowl champions are coming, I think next week or soon. Very soon. And they—every one of them want to be here. And the coach loves us. The coach is great. Andy Reid. And every one of them want to be here. We have—people love it. But we had all of the NCAA championship teams here. They had the golf, the basketball. They had every team here. And one of the teams was wrestling. The wrestling team. Was that Penn State? And Penn State won the title. They have a great team. And I walked up with Jim, and it's like I didn't exist. [Laughter] Those wrestlers, they grabbed him. They love Jim Jordan, and we love you too because you are some warrior. True. True.\nA woman who became a star—we have a couple of women that became stars. You two. And I always liked the name of her—you know, I liked the name, \"Lesko.\" I liked it. That's how I picked it. I liked the name. I saw that face. I saw that everything. They gave me cards. She had, like, seven opponents, right?\nAnd you have no idea how much the public appreciates how smart, how sharp you are. This I can't tell. I can't tell. They just said: \"You know, she's really good. She's really talented.\" And I said, \"Let's go.\" We worked with her. She won her race. Tough race. It's no longer tough. Because what she does out there is incredible. Arizona loves her.\nBut you were so incredible, representing—I don't say \"me\"—representing our country and getting it out of this impeachment hoax. What you did was incredible. So, Debbie, please stand up. Debbie Lesko.\nA man who I—I became very friendly with—I don't know why. Do you ever have where—I'll ask the media: If certain people call, you take their calls. Other people call—if they don't have information, they won't take anybody's call. But other people call, and you don't.\nThis is a guy—he just—he's just a very special guy. His wife I actually like better than him, to be honest. [Laughter] Because he doesn't know that I know that he didn't actually support me right from the beginning, but she did. [Laughter]\nAnd on my worst day—right?—on my worst day, my worst—I won't tell you why it was my worst, but it was not one of those good days—she got on a bus, got many other buses and women all over North Carolina, and they toured North Carolina. Well, Mark was back sort of semisupporting another candidate, which he ended up leaving very quickly. I don't think you had a choice, because of your wife, but thank her.\nAnd —Mark Meadows, he's an extraordinary guy. I mean, the only problem is, I guess, he's announcing—he'd only win by 40 points, but he's announcing that he'll be not running this time. Do you have somebody good to run? Somebody going to win your district by at least 20 points, please? Okay? But he's a tremendously talented man, not just as a politician. As a human being, he's incredible.\nAnd during these horrible times—I mean, the way he worked and Jim and all of you guys—the way they worked was so—it was like their life was at stake. So many.\nRon DeSantis is another one. He worked so hard. Then, he called me. He said, \"Sir, I'd like to run for Governor.\" I said: \"Governor? I don't want you to run. I like you staying.\" \"No, I want to run for Governor.\" And I said, \"Well, if you have to.\" \"I'd like your support.\" I said: \"How can I support you? You're at three.\" [Laughter] He was at three. He had no money. Somebody else was at 38, and they had $22 million cash, right? I said, \"Look, if it's important, I'll do it,\" because they—he's been another great warrior. And he's—by the way, he ran. I endorsed him. His numbers went through the roof.\nThe man who we beat, who was expected to win easily, called me after the race. He said: \"You endorsed him, and it was like a nuclear bomb went off. There was nothing I could do.\" He never even spent his money. He saved it. But Ron DeSantis is another one, and now he's the Governor of Florida. And, by the way, he's a great Governor. He's a very popular Governor. His numbers are in the 70s. And he's done a great job.\nBut, Mark, I want to thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you very much. Mark Meadows.\nAnd Mike Johnson of Louisiana. Where's Mike? Central casting. What a job. You can represent me anytime. You can represent me anytime. Thank you. What a job you've done. Thank you, Mike.\nAnd a man nobody has ever heard of, except the other side. He's the other side's worst nightmare. This guy goes down into dungeons and basements; he'll find a document, no matter what. He's the most legitimate human being. He's the hardest worker. He's unbelievable. He took tremendous abuse. I mean, abuse.\nThe—the media and, you know, the other side, and the bad ones, the leakers, the liars, the dirty cops—they wanted to destroy him. They tried. They got close, but he wouldn't let it happen. And, honestly, in a certain way, he was the first one. Wouldn't you say, Jim and Mark and everybody? This was the first guy. He came out of nowhere. He's saying, \"These people are corrupt.\" He's still saying it. And he was unbelievable. Devin Nunes. He was unbelievable. Unbelievable. [Applause] That's so true, Devin.\nHe'd come in and say—I didn't even know him, I just heard there were like—there was this Congressman who kept going into a basement—into files. [Laughter] He knew something was wrong. You felt it, right? And now we know a lot more than we knew then, right? You never thought it was as bad as it is. And hopefully, we're going to take care of things, because we can never, ever allow this to happen again.\nScott Perry of Pennsylvania. Scott, thank you. Thank you, Scott. Really great. And you're doing very well over there, by the way. Just saw your numbers. [Laughter]\nA man who is a—I mean, central casting. If I'm going to pick Perry Mason, I'm going to do a remake of Perry Mason—other than Bill Barr, I'd pick this guy. But I have to say, I'll pick Barr. I pick Barr first, right? [Laughter] John Ratcliffe, right? But I have to tell you, if we're doing a remake of Perry Mason, the man I get—there's nobody in Hollywood like this—John Ratcliffe, right? Stand up, John.\nSo—such a great lawyer. Incredible guy. Incredible talent. But just a great lawyer and we appreciate it. He gets on that screen, and everyone says, \"I agree.\" The other side folds up so fast. We'll probably be using a lot of you in the next year. But you have been fantastic, John. We appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nA man who's braver than me and braver than all of us in this room. He got whacked. He got whacked. My Steve, right? I went to the hospital with our great First Lady that night. Right, honey? And we saw a man that was not going to make it. He was not going to make it. He was—the doctor—and I told him his wife—I said, \"She loves you.\" \"Why do you say that?\" Because she was devastated.\nA lot of wives wouldn't give a damn. [Laughter] A lot of wives would have said, \"Oh, yes.\" I said, \"How's he doing?\" \"Oh\"—she couldn't even talk. She was inconsolable. Most wives would say: \"Not good. Listen, I'm going home now.\" [Laughter] But the doctor came in—the wife is like—she was a total mess. She was really devastated. And he really—it looked like he had a 20-, 25-percent chance. I think you set a record for blood loss.\nAnd, Steve Scalise, I—actually, honestly, I think you're better looking now. You're more handsome now. [Laughter] You—you weren't that good looking. You look good now. [Laughter] He looks better now. Can you believe it? I don't know what the hell that is. It's true. Better now. What a guy.\nAnd he was practicing—he was practicing for the baseball game against, I guess, the Democrats, right? And this whack-job started shooting. Hurt Roger—I don't know if Roger is here. But hurt a number of people—hit them. But really hit Steve. He—Steve was at second base. He was the second baseman. And he went down, and it was terrible. I mean, I saw the whole thing, and it was terrible.\nAnd fortunately, you had two brave policemen with you. Because of your high position in Congress, you had two policemen and they were amazing—the man and a woman. And they came and they didn't have rifles. They were against a, supposedly, pretty good sharpshooter with rifles, good equipment. And all they had was a gun. And they started coming in from the outfield, shooting. And they're so far away that a handgun is not preferred. And this guy has the rifle, and he's hitting people. And he was going to move up, and there was no out. I mean, if he would have been able to move up, there was no way to get out. The entrance was a single entranceway on the other side, where he was.\nSo everyone went into the dugout—ran into the dugout, but Steve was really hit badly in the stomach and with a bullet that rips you apart. It was supposed to do that. It rips you apart.\nAnd these two people came charging forward. Boom. Boom. Boom. And one of them—you know who—one of them—him?—got the shooter. Hit him. And then, got him. Killed him from the long distance. It was amazing. If you didn't have those two people—you can imagine, right? You could imagine what would happen.\nSo Melania and I went to the hospital that night. And he was in such bad shape, and he's been working ever since, so hard. But 6 months ago, they had a baseball game at the Nationals Park. And I'm watching, and it's on television. And it's just, you know, a game. People—you want to win it, right? And Steve's at second base. The poor guy can't even walk.\nDo you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees? He was known for range, Louie. Range. He had the greatest range. If a ball is hit to shortstop—Bobby Richardson is the second player, second baseman—Bobby Richardson would field the ball. If it's hit to first base, he'll throw it to the first baseman. He had unbelievable range. This was not Steve Scalise. [Laughter] Steve had no range. [Laughter] One foot and he has to fall down, right? Because, you know, he was trying to get better. I don't know who the hell put you on the field. [Laughter]\nAnd this is a true story. So the game starts and the first pitch—Steve is standing at second base, and the guy is really in bad shape. And I said, \"This is terrible.\" A shot—groundball shot—is hit to second and Steve. I say—I didn't have time to think too much, but I said: \"This is not good. That ball is going toward him.\"\nAnd this guy stopped that ball, caught the call. He's now laying down. He throws the ball to first base. He gets him out. I said, \"It's the most incredible thing.\" I've never seen—athletically—I've never seen anything like it, right?\nAnd he gets him out, and they then took him out of the game, which was a very wise thing, because you could never do that again in a million years. [Laughter] But you weren't going to let that ball go through. I don't care if it was hit by the greatest of all time, right? That ball was not going through you, because you are a warrior. Steve is—he is fantastic. You are fantastic. You and Liz and Kevin.\nWhat a great—what a group. I mean, what a group. I got lucky. I got lucky because you need the right people. If I had the wrong people there, he—maybe a different story. Maybe we'd be celebrating something else. But I really want to thank you, Steve Scalise. And, Elise, you—I just read this story; she's the most incredible—what's going on with you, Elise. So I even said—you know, I was up campaigning for her, helping her. But I thought: \"She looks good. She looks like good talent.\" But did I not realize, when she opens that mouth, you were killing them, Elise. [Laughter] You were killing them.\nElise—and there's a big story in the New York Post—I love the New York Post, because they treat me well. There aren't too many of you that do. But today, you're treating me well. I even had a great headline—New York Times, Washington Post. I had all of these great headlines. Maybe we should just end it right there. [Laughter]\nBut you had the greatest story, yesterday in the Post, that people from all over the country are contributing to her campaign. They were so enthralled with the way you handled yourself, what you said, the way you said it. And I'll always be your friend. I think it was—it's really an amazing story. What a great future you have. What a great future. Thank you. The First Lady agrees, by the way. The First Lady agrees.\nAnd Michael Turner, you can represent me anytime. Where's Michael? Where is he? Boy, you can represent me. How good were you? There's another Perry Mason type, I think. Right? What do you think, John? But, Michael, you were fantastic, and we appreciate it.\nBrad Wenstrup. Where's Brad? Brad. Great, great job. This is a big day for lawyers. You notice only the lawyers stayed? Only the lawyers stayed behind. Lee Zeldin. How good are you? How good are you? Man.\nAnd, Louie, your name is not down. They didn't give me your name. Do you know—if I didn't announce Louie—[laughter]—whoever the hell made this list I've got to get rid of, because I—if I wouldn't have announced Louie, it might have been the end of the Presidency. [Laughter] Louie, you have been so great. So tough and so smart. I got it just—[laughter]—I got it. But Louie has been amazing. He's a tough guy. He's a smart guy. He's streetwise like crazy. We love Texas, and we're with you all the way, Louie. We're with you all the way. Thank you very much.\nSo that's the story. We have a great group of warriors, and there are others left, and, I guess, probably, I'm sure I didn't mention a few, and I apologize if that's the case. How's CPAC doing? Good? Huh? My man, stand up please, will you? He's the one who said, \"You should run.\" Right?\nMatt said—it's like 5 years ago, 6 years ago. And I made a speech, and then they do some kind of a straw poll: \"Who made the best speech?\" And he said, \"I made the best speech.\" With all this professional—I hate to say this: With all these professional politicians, they voted, by far, the best speech was Trump. He calls me, he says, \"You should run for politics.\" I say, \"What do I know about politics?\" But you know what? We learned quickly, and our country has never done better than it's doing right now. So it's pretty good. But thank you, Matt. Great. Say hello.\nSo that's the story. We've been treated very unfairly. Fortunately, we have great men and women that came to our defense. If we didn't, this would have been a horrific incident for our country. When you have Lisa and Peter, the lovers, the FBI lovers—[laughter]—\"I want to believe the path you threw out for\"—Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. That's the office. \"There's no way he gets elected\"—meaning me. \"There's no way he gets elected.\"\nThis is Peter to Lisa. He's probably trying to impress her, for obvious reasons. [Laughter] \"There's no way he gets elected. But I'm afraid we can't take the risk.\" Now, think of this. In other words, if I get elected, they can't—\"they,\" two low-lifes—they can't take the risk. They can't take the risk. Think of it.\nAnd that's where it came up, the greatest word of all: \"insurance policy.\" So he says: \"But I'm afraid we can't take the risk. She may lose.\" It's like an insurance policy. In the unlikely event you die before you're 40—in other words, if I won, they were going to do exactly what they did to us. They were going to try and overthrow the Government of the United States, a duly elected President.\nAnd if I didn't fire James Comey, we would have never found this stuff. Because when I fired that sleazebag, all hell broke out. They were ratting on each other. They were running for the hills. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. It's in the hands of some very talented people. We're going to have to see what happens.\nBut I can tell you, in my opinion, these are the crookedest, most dishonest, dirtiest people I've ever seen. They said—this is Strzok: \"God, Hillary should win 100 million to 1.\" This is about me. This is an agent from the FBI. Look how they let her off. Thirty-three thousand e-mails deleted. Nothing happens to her. Nothing happens. It's unbelievable.\nBut think of that—\"God, Hillary should win one\"—when these guys are investigating Hillary. Then, they go to work for Mueller—the two of them—and when Mueller found out that everybody knew that they were a hundred percent this way, he let them go. But they deleted all of their e-mails and text messages.\nSo when we got the phone, they were all deleted. Could you imagine the treasure trove? They illegally deleted. So they left. They left Bob Mueller. He had the look, but he didn't have a lot of other things. Always had the look. Mr. G-Man. And I love the FBI, and the FBI loves me—99 percent. It was the top scum. And the FBI people don't like the top scum.\nSo think of that: 100 million to 1. And he's investigating me. And then, \"God, Trump is a loathsome human being, isn't he?\" These are the people looking at me. I'm really not a bad person. And Page said, \"Yes, he's awful.\" How would you like to have that? This is just—this is the good stuff. There's stuff a hundred times worse than that. These are all dirty people.\nAnd now I just heard that they're suing the United States of America, because they were interfered with. Ahh! We're not going to let it happen. Just not going to let it happen. We cannot let this happen to our country. We can't.\nSo I'm going to leave now. And I don't know if any of you have anything to say. You could say it. But this is sort of a day of celebration, because we went through hell.\nAnd I'm sure that Pelosi and Cryin' Chuck—I've known this guy all the—the only time I ever saw him cry was when it was appropriate. Known him for a long time. Cryin' Chuck. But I'm sure they'll try and cook up other things. They'll go through the State of New York. They'll go through other places. They'll do whatever they can. Because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do—in my opinion, it's almost like they want to destroy our country. We can't let it happen.\nNow, Jim Jordan, did you want to say something? Go ahead. Huh? Mark?\nRepresentative Mark R. Meadows. No, I just—I wanted to just say that this reflection today, it is a small reflection of the kind of support you have all across the country. We've got your back.\nThe President. Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nThis was a highly partisan situation. Pelosi said—I copied it down exactly. Before the impeachment—she wanted to impeach from day one, by the way. Don't let it fool you. You know, she said, \"No, the impeachment is a very serious thing.\" I said: \"She wants to impeach. Watch.\"\nImpeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan—bipartisan. It was 197 to nothing. And other than one failed Presidential candidate—and I call that \"half a vote,\" because he actually voted for us on the other one. But we had one failed Presidential candidate. That's the only half a vote we lost. So we had almost 53 to nothing. We had 197 to nothing. And the only one that voted against was a guy that can't stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the Presidency.\nBut she said: \"There's something so compelling—it has to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan. I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country\"—she was right about that—\"and it's just not worth it.\" That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago. Right?\nAnd I think it's a shame. I think it's a shame. But as I said, if we can put this genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and all of the things we can do—prescription drugs. You know, we had—Secretary Azar is here, and I want to thank him for this, but we had—first time in 51 years, where drug prices actually came down last year, first time in 51 years. But what we can do, working with both parties in Congress, is—would be unbelievable. It would be unbelievable, all we can do.\nAnd I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it, and Mitch is working very hard on it. But what we can do is incredible. What we can do, just generally. We've done so much without it. We've rebuilt our military. We've cut regulations at a level that nobody thought possible. We'll always protect our Second Amendment; we all know that.\nBut I just want to tell you that it's an honor to be with you all. I want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony, rotten deal by some very evil and sick people. And Ivanka is here, and my sons and my whole family, and that includes Barron. That includes Barron, who is up there as a young boy.\nStand up, honey. Ivanka, thank you, honey. Come. Come.\n[The President hugged his daughter, Adviser to the President Ivanka M. Trump.]\nCome here, baby.\n[The President hugged the First Lady, who then joined him at the podium.]\nSo I just want to thank my family for sticking through it. This was not part of the deal. And I was going to run for President, and if I won, I was going do a great job. I didn't know that I was going to run, and then when I got in, I was going to have to run again and again and again. Every week, I had to run again. That wasn't the deal, but they stuck with me.\nAnd I'm so glad I did it, because we are making progress and doing things for our great people that everybody said couldn't be done. Our country is thriving. Our country is just respected again. And it's an honor to be with the people in this room.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nNOTE: The President spoke at 12:21 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James B.

Transcript courtesy of The White House)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, thank you very much. It’s a great honor to be with Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO. This is our first meeting, meaning my first meeting of this trip. But we’ve met many times.\nI think he’s doing a fantastic job. I’m a big fan. His contract was extended; I was very happy about that. But you really are - you’re doing a fantastic job. We appreciate it.\nI think the Secretary General will tell you that, through some work and some negotiation, we’ve increased the budget of countries other than the USA, because we’re paying far more than anybody else, and far more even as a percentage of GDP. But we’ve increased the numbers that other countries are paying, by $130 billion. It was going down for close to 20 years. If you look at a chart, it was like a rollercoaster down, nothing up. And that was going on for a long time. You wouldn’t have had a NATO if you kept going that way.\nAnd now we’ve really increased it incredibly well, and I’m happy to have helped. But the Secretary has been looking to do that for a long time. And, I can tell you, he’s very happy about it.\nAnd, just generally, we’re going to have a very big couple of days. I believe we’re going to have a tremendous couple of days, but very big, very important. We have tremendous spirit, as it pertains to NATO, I would say - except, perhaps, for one country. And we’ll be talking to that one country. We’ll see how it works out. And, actually, the one country has a couple of points, but those points are very devastating to NATO. But we’ll find out about that during the next two days.\nAnd, with that, I’d like to introduce the Secretary General. Say a few words. Please.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Thank you so much, Mr. President. It’s good to see you again, and I’m looking forward to celebrate the 70th anniversary of our alliance together with all the other leaders, today and tomorrow.\nWe are making real progress, most importantly on the burden sharing. And your leadership on defense spending is having a real impact. Since 2016, Canada and European allies have added $130 billion more to the defense budgets, and this number will increase to 400 billion U.S. dollars by 2024.\nThis is unprecedented. This is making NATO stronger. And it shows that this Alliance is adapting, responding when the world is changing.\nWe will, of course, also address a wide range of other issues, including the fight against terrorism, arms control, our relationship with Russia, the rise of China. And NATO is the most successful alliance in history because we have been able to change when the world is changing. That’s exactly what we are doing again. And the fact is that we are doing more together in this Alliance now than we have done for many decades.\nSo, once again, thank you for your leadership and your strong commitment to NATO.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I loved your statement that we’re able to change when the world is changing. And you do have to do that. Your original mission was somewhat different than it is now. Today, the world is a lot different than it was back then. But that’s a very profound statement, and it’s a statement that everybody has to understand. It’s very - to me, it’s very important.\nOkay. Thank you very much, everybody.\nQ Mr. President, you’re here in London. Are you going to be seeing Prime Minister Johnson?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes.\nQ And do you have any thoughts on the upcoming election?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I have no thoughts on it. It’s going to be a very important election for this great country. But I have no thoughts on it. I will be meeting with him, yes.\nQ When will that be?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I don’t know. I have the schedule over here. I have - I have many meetings. I have meetings set up with lots of different countries.\nQ What do you think about President Macron’s criticism about NATO, saying that it is “brain dead”?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Who said that?\nQ President Macron.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I know. And then, Turkey responded by saying that he was brain dead, which was interesting.\nNow, NATO serves a great purpose. It got to be unfair for the United States because the United States was paying a disproportionate amount. And I heard that President Macron said NATO is “brain dead.” I think that’s very insulting to a lot of different forces, including the man that does a very good job in running NATO.\nNo, it has a great purpose, especially with the fact that NATO is becoming much more flexible, in terms of what it looks at.\nBut I was very surprised. I’d like to ask you: What did you think? He made a statement about NATO being “brain dead.” What did you think?\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Well, I - that’s not the case because, actually, NATO is active. NATO is agile. NATO is adapting. And we have just implemented the largest reinforcement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War, with high readiness of troops.\nFor the first time in our history, we have combat-ready troops in the eastern part of the Alliance. European allies and Canada are investing more also in high-end capabilities, and we are stepping up the fight against terrorism. And we are, as an Alliance, for the first time also addressing the security implications of the rise of China.\nSo the reality is that this Alliance has proven, once again, to be able to adapt, to change, responding to a changing world. So that’s the reason why we are a success: the ability to change when the world is changing.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: It’s a tough statement, though, when you make a statement like that. That is a very - a very, very nasty statement to, essentially, 28 - including them - 28 countries.\nI think that - you know, you have a very high unemployment rate in France. France is not doing well, economically, at all. They’re starting to tax other people’s products, so therefore, we go and tax them. That’s just taking place right now, on technology, and we’re doing their wines and everything else.\nAnd it’s - it’s a very tough statement to make when you have such difficulty in France. You look at what’s happened with the yellow vests, or you look at what’s going on during certain parts of their season. They’ve had a very rough year. And you just can’t go around making statements like that about NATO. It’s very disrespectful.\nQ Mr. President, the Department of Justice Inspector General’s report is due out soon. And it’s been reported that the Attorney General disagrees with that conclusion. Do you agree with Attorney General Barr? Do you have any comments on that?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I just don’t know. Yeah, I just don’t know. I haven’t seen it. I purposefully stay out of it. We have a great Attorney General. He’s a very fair man. He’s a great gentleman.\nHe didn’t need this job. He took this job because he wanted to do something great for the country. As you know, he was a very successful man. Picked a great company to work - when he left, as you know, he picked a great company to work for. But this is a successful man. Didn’t need the job. He’s doing a great job.\nI have not seen the report. Perhaps he’s read the report. I think he was quoted incorrectly. I do believe that, because I’m hearing their - the report is very powerful. But I’m hearing that by lots of different things - not from inside information; it’s really from outside information.\nI think all we have to do is wait. Isn’t it going to be released on Monday - Monday or so? I think we have to read it and we have to see it. But I hear there’s a lot of devastating things in that report. But we’ll see what happens. Look, we have a few days to wait. We’ve been all waiting a long time.\nI do think the big report to wait for is going to be the Durham report. That’s the one that people are really waiting for. And he’s highly respected. And we’re - and he’s worked very hard. And he’s worked long hours, I can tell you, and gone all over world. So we’ll see. But the Durham report is the report people are really looking forward to.\nBut this is a very important report. The IG report is a very important report. If what I read is correct - I read it in your newspaper - if what I read is correct, that would be a little disappointing. But it was just one asset - one aspect of the report. We’ll see what happens. We’ll see it. It’s coming out in a few days. I hear it’s devastating, but we’ll soon find out.\nQ (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes?\nQ How do you plan to bring NATO together at the summit?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I think the Secretary General has done a good job in bringing NATO together. You know, it’s been unfair because the United States is paying 4 percent, and some people could say 4.3 percent, of the largest GDP there is in the world, by far, because we’ve brought it to a level that nobody thought even possible. So we’re paying 4 to 4.3 percent, when Germany is paying 1 to 1.2 percent - at max, 1.2 percent - of a much smaller GDP. That’s not fair.\nAnd it’s - look, it’s not - it’s not fair also when you have the European Union - many of these are the same countries - but you have the European Union treating the United States very, very unfairly on trade. The deficit, for many, many years - for decades - but the deficit, for many, many years, has been astronomical with the United States and Europe - in their favor. And I’m changing that, and I’m changing it fairly rapidly.\nBut it’s not - it’s not right to be taken advantage of on NATO, and also, then, to be taken advantage of on trade. And that’s what happens. And we can’t let that happen. So, we’re talking to the European Union, and we’re talking to various countries about NATO. But we’re talking to the European Union about trade. And they have to shape up; otherwise, things are going to get very tough.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: But let me just add that NATO is the only place where North America and Europe meet every day, where we discuss, decide, and take actions together, responding to a wide range of different security threats and challenges. And we do that more now than we have done for many, many years.\nAnd the reality is that - not least because it has been so clearly conveyed from President Trump that we need fair burden sharing - Allies are stepping up. And we are also modernizing this Alliance, responding to new challenges in cyber, in space. We will declare space as a new operational domain for NATO, something we never had before.\nSo it just highlights that, well, there are differences because we are 29 different countries from both sides of the Atlantic, with different political parties in power, with different history, different geography. But despite these differences, we have always been able to unite around our core task to protect and defend each other because we are stronger and safer together. And I’m absolutely certain that that will also be the case now.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I would say - I would say that nobody needs NATO more than France. If you just look back over the last long period of time, nobody needs NATO more than France.\nAnd, frankly, the one that benefits, really, the least is the United States. We benefit the least. We’re helping Europe. Europe unites and they go against a common foe. That may or may not be a foe; can’t tell you that. But there are other foes out there also.\nBut I think nobody needs it more than France. And that’s why I think that when France makes a statement like they made about NATO, that’s a very dangerous statement for them to make.\nQ You mentioned the digital tax, sir. What would it take for you not to impose those tariffs on the French products?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, look, I’m not in love with those companies - Facebook and Google and all of them, Twitter - although I guess I do pretty well with Twitter, on the other side. But I’m not necessarily in love with those companies. But they’re our companies. They’re American companies. I want to tax those companies. They’re not going to be taxed by France.\nSo France is going to put a tax on them. It was totally out of the blue. He just had the idea. Emmanuel had an idea: “Let’s tax those companies.” Well, they’re American companies. I’m not going to let people take advantage of American companies. Because if anyone is going to take advantage of the American companies, it’s going to us. It’s not going to be France.\nAnd so we’re taxing - as you know, we’re taxing their wines and everything else. And we have a very, very big tax to put on them. Plus, we have a tax going on on Airbus, and that’ll be a good thing for Boeing. But we’re only going to do that if it’s necessary.\nAs you know, we won - in the World Trade Organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars. We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations. And now they realize - the World Trade Organization realizes that my attitude on them: If they don’t treat us fairly, well, I’ll tell you someday what will happen.\nAnd we’ve been winning a lot of cases at the World Trade Organization. We virtually - very rarely did we ever win a case. They took advantage of the United States.\nSo that’s where it is. We won seven and a half billion dollars. And if France puts a tax on our companies - again, these are companies that are against - you know, they were against me, if I read the papers correctly. I don’t know why they were against me, but they were against me. They’re supposed to be very powerful. And yet, I won. So maybe they’re not so powerful.\nBut they’re American companies. I don’t want France taxing American companies. If they’re going to be taxed, it’s going to be the United States will tax them. Okay?\nQ And why are you staying out of the British election, sir? Are you making a conscious decision -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Because I don’t want to complicate it. I can - look, I’ve won a lot of elections for a lot of people. If you look, just over the last few months: two elections in North Carolina I won; I helped the governor of Kentucky. I mean, the press doesn’t write it, but they went up, supposedly, 17, 18, 19 points because of my - he lost by just a little bit. But I lifted him 19 points.\nIn Louisiana, I got them into a runoff. And after getting them into a runoff, he picked up 14 points because they thought he was going to lose to a popular governor - John Bel Edwards. Good guy. Popular governor. He almost won. He lost by less than a point.\nBut with the exception of those two races, where I had a huge impact because I raised them up almost to victory and they had no chance - with the exception of those two, I’ve won virtually every race that I’ve participated in.\nBut this is a different country. And, you know, I say often: In Germany, they like Obama. The reason they like Obama is because Obama gave the ship away. He allowed them to take everything. He gave them things that I wouldn’t do.\nAnd I love Germany. I love this country. I love a lot of countries. But I’m representing the U.S. So they may not like me because I’m representing us. And I represent us strong. President Obama did not represent us strong. He gave everything away, and he shouldn’t have done that. And that’s why we’re still paying a price for what he did.\nSo I’ll stay out of the election. You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before. I was opening up Turnberry the day before Brexit. You were there; many of you were there. I mean, I recognize that many of you were there. And they asked me whether or not Brexit would happen. I said “yes,” and everybody smiled and they laughed. And I said, “Yes, it’s going to happen, in my opinion.” It was just my opinion. The next day, they had the election, and I was right.\nBut I stay out of it. I think Boris is very capable, and I think he’ll do a good job.\nQ How is your relationship with President Macron -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Say it?\nQ How is your relationship with President Macron, going into this meeting this afternoon?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I think it’s fine. I’ve always had a good relationship with Emmanuel. And sometimes he’ll say things that he shouldn’t say. And I disagree with some of his policies with respect to France, but he’s got to do what he’s got to do. And sometimes I think he does things that are counterproductive for his own country.\nQ Mr. President, could you work with a possible Prime Minister Corbyn? Or is that beyond your -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Say it?\nQ Would you be able to work with a possible Prime Minister Corbyn? Or is that -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I can work with anybody. I’m a very easy person to work with, you know. You wouldn’t believe it. Look at this gentleman. When I came in, I was angry at NATO. And now I’ve raised $130 billion.\nAnd, by the way, you’re talking annually. You know, you’re talking about a tremendous amount of money. You’re talking about -\nQ And would you want to see -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: You’re talking about numbers that are astronomical. And yet, you still have many delinquent - you know, I call them “delinquent” when they’re not paid up in full.\nAnd then, I asked the other question: When they don’t pay up in full, what happens to the past year? So let’s say Germany is at 1 percent and they stay at 1 percent and another 1. Well, does that mean it disappears over the last five years or if they haven’t paid? You know, nobody has ever asked that question.\nIt’s not a bad question for you to be asking. Because, you know, it’s not like, “Oh, gee. Let’s start a brand-new year.” A lot of countries haven’t paid. And you could make the case that they haven’t paid. They’re, really, delinquent for 25, 30 years. And then you add all that up, and NATO is a very rich system. You know that, right?\nSo, you know, they haven’t chosen to go that way. But when Germany is at 1 to 1.2 percent, and when they don’t pay up to the 2 - and, let me tell you, the 2 is a very low number. You know, it really should be 4. It shouldn’t be 2; it should be 4. But that’s the way it is.\nYeah. Please.\nQ Mr. President, are you concerned at all that the impeachment inquiry back home - Congress is preparing to impeach you - that it weakens your position, as the President, here at NATO?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I don’t think so. You know, I know most of the leaders. I get along with them.\nIt’s a hoax. The impeachment thing is a hoax. It’s turned out to be a hoax. It’s done for purely political gain. They’re going to see whether or not they can do something in 2020, because otherwise they’re going to lose.\nIt’s turning out - and you see it better than anybody. I read something in your paper the other day that it’s having a reverse effect, which some people thought it might have; I didn’t know.\nBut I can tell you, the districts where I won, and then they had an election in between mine - but they had an election and other people got in; Democrats got in - those districts are leaning very big toward me. Now, I wasn’t in the race in 2018. So it’s not really the same thing. And a lot of my voters say they’re not going to vote unless Trump is actually in the race.\nBut it’s really having a tremendous impact on - and a lot of Democrats, I hear, are very upset. They just got back from their district, and I hear they’re very upset.\nThe impeachment witch hunt - it’s really just a continuation of the hoax that’s been taking place for the last three years. And I think you know that.\nQ And does it cast a cloud, though, as you’re trying to negotiate on behalf of the United States?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I would say this: I think it’s very unpatriotic of the Democrats to put on a performance where they do that. I do. I think it - I think it’s a bad thing for our country. Impeachment wasn’t supposed to be used that way. All you have to do is read the transcripts; you’ll see there was absolutely nothing done wrong. They had legal scholars looking at the transcripts the other day, and they say, “These are absolutely perfect. Trump is right when he uses the word.”\nThose concept - those calls that we made - two of them - were absolutely perfect calls. And I think it’s a very bad thing for our country.\nDoes it cast a cloud? Well, if it does, then the Democrats have done a very great disservice to the country, which they have. They’ve wasted a lot of time. We’re trying to get prescription drugs reduced very substantially. We could do it easily. They don’t have any time to do anything. I call them the “Do Nothing Democrats.” They are hurting our country very badly.\nQ Mr. President, will you meet with President Erdoğan here? And is there still -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I may. I may. I have a very good relationship. I may. I - you know, it could be - I don’t know - I don’t know if it’s on the schedule. But if it isn’t, I would.\nQ And is there still a place for Turkey in NATO after its invasion of Syria a couple weeks ago?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I’d have to ask the other countries. I mean, I have my own views, but I wouldn’t say it here.\nGood relationship with Turkey. We left their border. We’ve been on their border long enough. They’re doing just fine on their border. We kept the oil. I kept the oil. The only people we have over there now - we have a few that - a small group that are fighting the remnants of ISIS because they’ve popped up again and we put them down.\nWe’ve defeated the ISIS caliphate. Nobody thought we could do that so quickly. I did it very quickly. When I came in, it was virtually 100 percent. And I knocked it down to 0. I knocked it down to 0. But it pops up every once in a while.\nSo we have a very small group there. And we’re - and we’re doing it with others, in all fairness. But, importantly, we kept the oil. And the oil is what fueled ISIS. That’s what fueled them. That’s what they - that’s what gave them the economic strength to do what they did.\nAnd, of course, we killed al-Baghdadi. And we also killed his second. So that was very important, because he was trying to re-form ISIS.\nQ Should the National Health Service be on the table on trade talks with the United Kingdom?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Say it.\nQ Should the National Health Service be on the table in trade talks with the United Kingdom?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, not at all. I have nothing to do with it. Never ever thought about it, honestly. We have enough -\nLook, we are going to have a great healthcare system. We’re doing great healthcare work. We’ve got things really running well. And if we get - if we get elected - if we take the House, keep the Senate, keep the White House - we’ll have phenomenal healthcare.\nBut right now, we’ve made it very good. And we have 180 million people on plans that they absolutely love - private plans that they absolutely love.\nBut in this country - no, they have to work that out for themselves. We have absolutely - I don’t even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it, and we wouldn’t want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.\nQ There’s some talk of - among lawmakers - of censuring you, instead of impeachment. What do you think about that?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Unacceptable. I did nothing wrong. I heard about it. Now they want to go to censure because they have no case for impeachment, so they want to go to censure. I don’t want them to go to censure. I did nothing - I don’t mind be censured if you do something wrong. I did nothing wrong.\nI had a great conversation, very respectful conversation with the President - a good person, by the way - with the President of Ukraine. It was flawless. People have analyzed it from 15 different ways. It was flawless.\nYou know, there were many people on that line, including the Secretary of State. And one person - two people had a complaint. And you take a look at those two people, and you tell me. But many people - and I know there were many people on the line. I mean, there’s always a lot of people when you speak to a head of state. Not only our people, they had people also. Many people, probably.\nNo, I wouldn’t be happy with that at all. No. That’s - to me, it’s unacceptable. I did nothing wrong. You don’t censure somebody when they did nothing wrong.\nThey’re in search of a crime - that’s what they are. They’re what you call an “investigation in search of a crime.” There was no - not only wasn’t there a crime; it’s not even a word that should be used.\nI had a very, very good conversation with the head of Ukraine. And, by the way, yesterday, he came out again and reaffirmed again that we had a very, very respectful, good conversation - that President Trump did nothing wrong. He doesn’t even really understand what’s going on over here. They look at us like, “Is this country crazy?” The Democrats have gone nuts. They’re crazy. And it’s very bad for our country.\nQ Do you see a greater divide between the U.S. and Europe now, in NATO?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Say it?\nQ Do you see a greater divide in NATO between the U.S. and the rest of Europe?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, not with us, but I do see France breaking off. I’m looking at him and I’m saying, you know, he needs protection more than anybody, and I see him breaking off. So I’m a little surprised at that.\nQ Is Turkey a dependable ally or dependable member of NATO? And when will you bring sanctions against them for -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: But the first part of your question, say it again.\nQ Thank you. Is Turkey a dependable member of NATO? And when will you bring sanctions against them for buying Russian S-400 missiles?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, it’s a country that I happen to have a good relationship with. We did a deal that everybody was very critical of and now they’re saying it works. And I read a couple of stories just two days ago that, “Wow, that deal that Trump did with Turkey” - because I want to get our soldiers out of there. I don’t want to be policing a border that’s been fought over for 2,000 years. I want to get them out, but I wanted to keep the oil. And now they’re saying, “That was a great deal that Trump made.” I took a lot of heat over that deal.\nNo, I think that, as far as I’m concerned, I like Turkey and I get along very well with the President. And I - you know, I would hope that he’s a very good member of NATO, or will be. But we’ll see what it is in the future.\nCould I ask you that question?\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Yes, but Turkey is an important NATO Ally - and you can just look at the map. They’re bordering Iraq and Syria - the only Ally that borders that part of the world. And Turkey has been enormously important in our joint efforts to fight ISIS/Daesh. We have been able to liberate, in the U.S.-led coalition to defeat ISIS, all the territory that ISIS controlled just a few months ago, and more than 8 million people that were under ISIS control. And we have done that not least by using infrastructure bases in Turkey. So, in the fight against ISIS, Turkey has played a key role.\nThen, many allies have expressed a concern about Turkish military operation into northeast Syria. But following the agreement between the United States and Turkey, when Vice President Pence went to Ankara, we have seen that Turkey has stalled its military operations in northeast Syrian, and has seen a significant reduction in violence. And now we have to build on that and try to find a political solution to the crisis in Syria.\nLet me also add, on the question about Europe and North America: Yes, there are differences, as there has always been, dating back to the Suez Crisis in ’56, all the way to the Iraq War in 2003. So it’s nothing new that 29 allies have different views on many different things: trade, climate change, and other things.\nBut again, the strength of NATO is that, despite these differences, we have proven again and again able to unite around our core task to protect and defend each other. And that’s exactly what they’re doing now. We are doing more together, North America and Europe, than have done for many decades.\nSo the paradox is that, despite so much, as I say, some political differences, we are always able to agree and unite around our core task to stay together.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: And I will say this: Three weeks ago, when we got al-Baghdadi, Turkey was very helpful. We flew over areas that were totally controlled by Turkey and the Turkish military. We say, “We’re coming.” They absolutely were very supportive, actually. We didn’t tell them what we were doing and where we were going. Turkey could not have been nicer, could not have been more supportive. And that’s important.\nAnd I wanted to say that, in keeping the oil, ISIS was trying to, as you know, regain control of the oil. And we have total control of the oil. And, frankly, we had a lot of support from a lot of different people. But, right now, the only soldiers we have, essentially, in that area, are the soldiers keeping the oil. So we have the oil, and we can do with the oil what we want.\nQ But Turkey bought Russian missiles. How is that being on the side of NATO?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, they did. And they tried to buy ours, and the Obama administration said, “You can’t have them.” Okay?\nQ Would you give them to them?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: The Obama administration said, “You can’t have the Patriots. You can’t - we’re not going to sell them to you.” And they said that a number of times. And then Turkey went out and bought the Russian missile. So we’ll see what happens. We’re still talking about it. But they wanted to buy the Patriots; they tried to buy the Patriots. I think most of you know that. And they were shut off from buying the Patriots. They were not allowed to buy it. So that puts him in a bind also.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: But the Russian system will not be integrated into the Integrated NATO Air and Missile Defence Systems, because these Russian systems cannot work together with the rest of the NATO systems, of course.\nAnd I welcome the fact that there are talks going on between the United States and Turkey, looking into some alternative systems - the Patriots - and also the fact that NATO actually augments - we have deployed - we augmented the Turkish air and missile defense system today with the deployment of Patriot batteries by NATO, in Turkey.\nSo we address this issue and we try to find a way to solve it because it’s now creating some problems internally in the Alliance.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: And, as you know, Turkey bought billions and billions - it was one of the largest orders of F-35s, which is the greatest fighter jet in the world. And all they’re going to do now is go to another country, whether it’s Russia or China. They don’t want to do that; they want to buy the best planes. But, you know, they’re making it very difficult for, in a way, themselves, but they’re also making it difficult in Washington for them to buy that plane.\nBut they want to buy. They have a very big order out. They’ve already put up billions of dollars; they’ve given it to Lockheed Martin.\nQ Mr. President, have you made a decision as to whether you’ll have counsel present at future impeachment hearings?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Say it?\nQ Have you made a decision as to whether you’ll have White House counsel present at future impeachment hearings?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I’m not even thinking about it. I’m only thinking about this: The impeachment hoax is going nowhere. We have tremendous support. In the history of the Republican Party, there has not been this support. We have 196 to nothing, in terms of votes in the Congress. And as far as I’m concerned, I hear the Senate is angry about - the Republican senators are very angry about what’s going on because they hurt our country. They’re hurting our country - the other side - very badly.\nWe have tremendous support. Probably the most united that our Party has ever been. I just had a 95 percent approval rating. It’s the highest in the history of the Republican Party. Ronald Reagan was 87; he’s second. The Party has never been this united - the Republican Party.\nThe impeachment is going nowhere. It is a waste of time. They’re wasting their time. And it’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace to our country.\nQ How will you convince the Republican senators to agree that your conduct with Ukraine was perfect and flawless? Because a number of them, as you know, have been critical of your conduct, even though they say (inaudible).\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, that’s only - the only people that are critical are people that haven’t read the conversation that I had. And in some cases, they haven’t read.\nAre you okay back there? What happened? You getting into a fistfight or something?\nQ Secretary Pompeo is causing trouble. (Laughs.)\nQ I’m wondering if you think he should run for Senate.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: No - oh, oh. Oh, I thought you (inaudible) something. Who is that?\nSECRETARY POMPEO: I’m right back here, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, okay. I thought they got into a little fistfight back there. That’s happened a couple of times with you people.\nNo, I think the Republican Party is, right now, more united than they’ve ever been. When people read the - I always say, “Read the transcript.” I also say, “Take a look at what the President of Ukraine said.” And he said it numerous times, including, very powerfully, yesterday. Because that’s the only thing that really - that’s it. Then you have people heard third-hand, fourth-hand, second-hand.\nNo, we have tremendous support in the Republican Party. There never has been support like this. In fact, I would always complain that the Democrats, I think, are lousy politicians with horrible policy: open borders, sanctuary cities, high taxes - they want to raise your taxes. But they’ve always stuck together. I respect that. And the Republicans, I’ve always said, have better policy, but, historically, they haven’t stuck together the same way.\nThere has never been a time where the Republican Party has been more united. This is a witch hunt by the Democrats. It’s a continuation. It’s been going on now for three years. Actually, from before the election it’s been going on. You’ll probably see that after the report is released on Monday or Tuesday.\nBut this is just a witch hunt that’s very bad for our country. But I’ll tell you, it’s been very unifying for the Republicans and for my base.\nQ And a point of clarification. In your opening remarks, you were very critical of one country but you didn’t name the country. What country were you talking about?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I’d rather have you guess. You’re a very good reporter. I’d rather have you guess. I’ll probably agree with your assumptions.\nQ Mr. President, would you like to see Secretary Pompeo run for Senate in Kansas?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: So, he’s a tremendous guy doing a tremendous job. And I would say this: If I thought we were going to lose that seat - because we shouldn’t lose that seat; it’s a great state; it’s a state that I won overwhelmingly, as you know; we shouldn’t lose that state - then I would sit down and talk to Mike. But you could never find anybody that could do a better job as Secretary of State.\nBut if we thought we were going to lose that, I would have a talk to Mike. If - Mike is - if you look at polling, Mike would walk away with that seat. If I thought there was a risk to losing that seat, I would say that I would sit down very seriously and talk to Mike, and find out how he feels about it.\nHe loves what he’s doing. He’s doing a great job, as you know.\nQ Could I ask you about NATO? Why is China such an important subject for this NATO Summit? What threat do they pose?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, China has become very powerful and much more so than in the past. They’ve done it, largely, with United States money, because our past Presidents allowed them to steal the cookie cutter. And that’s okay - I don’t begrudge China for that. I begrudge - I’m very disappointed in our past Presidents and leadership. They allowed this to happen. There’s no way it should’ve happened.\nAnd, by the way, I’m doing very well in a deal with China, if I want to make it. If I want to make it. I don’t think it’s “if they want to make it”; it’s “if I want to make it.” And we’ll see what happens. But I’m doing very well, if I want to make a deal. I don’t know that I want to make it, but you’re going to find out pretty soon. We’ll surprise everybody.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: But, as you know, historically, NATO has been focused on the Soviet Union and Russia, so it’s not something new that we now are also addressing the implications for our security by the rise of China. But we have to do that because China is now the second-largest defense spender in the world, after the United States.\nThey recently displayed a lot of new advanced military weapons systems, including new intercontinental ballistic missiles able to reach the whole of Europe and the United States; hypersonic weapons, gliders; and they also deployed hundreds of intermediate-range missiles that would have violated the INF Treaty if China had been part of that treaty.\nIt’s not about moving NATO into the South China Sea, but it’s about taking into account the fact that China is coming to closer to us. We see them in the Arctic. We see them in Africa. We see them investing heavily in European infrastructure. And, of course, we see China in cyberspace.\nSo the rise of China - there are some opportunities, but also some challenges, and we need to face them together. And I think it’s a good thing that Europe and North America do that together. Because, together, North America and Europe, we are 50 percent of world GDP and 50 percent of the world’s military might. So as long as we are together, we are bigger and stronger than any other potential adversary.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: And I think that’s important because it’s a very different NATO. I mean, this has become - I really think since I’ve joined, since I’ve come in - we have a very good relationship.\nThis used to be a NATO on one country. They didn’t even talk about anything else. And now, really, we are looking at all over the world, because they’re - you know, the world changes. Seventy years it is; it’s a long time. And the world has changed a lot. And I don’t think, frankly, before us, that NATO was changing at all with it. And NATO is really changing right now. So it’s a different NATO. It’s covering a lot more territory. It’s covering hotspots. It’s covering a lot of things that were never even contemplated or thought of even five years ago. If you go back five years, they wouldn’t even be thinking about the things that we’re doing now.\nSo - and I’ve become a bigger fan of NATO because they’ve been so flexible. If they weren’t flexible, I think I would probably be not so happy. But they are very flexible, and this gentleman is doing a great job.\nOkay?\nQ Are you still - are you still planning to come to Germany?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I will come to Germany, sure. I love Germany. I love the people of Germany.\nQ Mr. President, why has North Korea continued its nuclear program despite your various meetings?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we’ll see. I have confidence in him. I like him. He likes me. We have a good relationship. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens. He definitely likes sending rockets up, doesn’t he? That’s why I call him “Rocket Man.”\nQ Was that helpful do you think - calling him “Rocket Man”?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: But we have a very good - we have a very good relationship and we’ll see what happens. It may work out; it may not. But, in the meantime, it’s been a long time.\nPresident Obama said it’s the number-one problem. And it would’ve been war; you’d be in a war right now if it weren’t for me. If I weren’t President, you’d be in a war right now in Asia, and who knows where there that leads. But that brings in -\nQ Mr. President, you’ve met with -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: - that brings in a lot of other countries.\nQ Mr. President, you’ve met with Kim Jong Un three times now, and yet he continues to build his nuclear program and test his missiles. So what more will it take?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, you don’t know that. Number one, you don’t know that. And number two, very importantly, I have met and, in the meantime, we still have peace. We have peace. And at least, speaking for myself, I have a very good personal relationship, and he has with me. I’m possibly the only one he has that kind of relationship with in the world. They call it the “Hermit Kingdom.”\nI know a lot about his “Hermit Kingdom,” but I have a very good relationship. If you would’ve listened to President Obama, we’d be in a World War Three right now. So we’ll see what happens.\nHey, look - we are more powerful, militarily, than we ever have been. And I will tell you, when I took over the United States military, when I became Commander-in-Chief, our military was depleted, our military was in trouble. You know that better than anybody. We had old planes; we had old everything. We didn’t have ammunition. Now we have the most powerful military we’ve ever had and we’re by far the most powerful country in the world. And, hopefully, we don’t have to use it, but if we do, we’ll use it. If we have to, we’ll do it.\nBut, you know, my relationship with Kim Jong Un is really good, but that doesn’t mean he won’t abide by the agreement we signed. You have to understand. You have to go and look at the first agreement that we signed. It said he will denuclearize. That’s what it said. I hope he lives up to the agreement, but we’re going to find out.\nNow, in the meantime, we’re working with South Korea because it’s burden sharing. And we’re spending a tremendous amount of money to protect South Korea, and we think that it’s fair that they pay substantially more.\nLast year, I asked them to pay more and they agreed. And nobody knows this - I’ll say it now, I think, for the first time - but they agreed to pay approximately $500 million a year or more for protection. That’s $500 million. Now we only had a month or two before the budget ended, so they said, “No, no, no.” And, you know, they’re very good businesspeople; you see how they do on trade. But they agreed to pay almost $500 million a year more. That got them up to a billion dollars - close to a billion dollars. That’s a lot of money. I did that with a number of phone calls and a meeting.\nNow, we’re negotiating for them to pay more, because the United States is paying a lot of money to protect South Korea and we think it’s fair that they pay up and pay more. We have a very good relationship, but we think it’s fair that they pay more. I’m not sure if anybody knows. Did you know about the $500 million that they agreed to pay more?\nQ No, sir. Can you tell us more about it? (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah. I met with them six, seven months ago - maybe a little bit longer than that. And I said, “You’re not paying enough. It’s not fair.”\nThey were paying $500 - they were paying less than $500 million a year and it costs us billions. And I said, “It’s not fair. We do a great job. We have 32,000 soldiers there. It cost us, you know, many times what you’re paying. And you have to pay up.”\nAnd they said - again, in a very good way, very fine negotiation. And they were very close to being at the end of their budget, and we agreed to $500 million more, almost - around $500 million. And that got them up to close to a billion dollars from $500 million - really less than $500 million, which has been that number for many, many years - decades. And I got $500 million more a year.\nSo, it’s $500 million a year. That’s a lot of money. But it’s still substantially less than it costs. So now we’re in a negotiation for them to pay more. And they can do that because they’re a very rich country.\nQ And is it -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Did - you didn’t know about that, did you?\nQ No. That’s interesting. Do you -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Good. I wonder if I’ll get a good story for that. I don’t think so.\nQ Do you believe it’s in America’s -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I don’t get - I don’t get good stories.\nQ Is it in America’s national security interests to continue to have all of those troops in the Korean Peninsula in the region?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: It can be debated. I can go either way. I can make arguments both ways. But I think it’s - I do think this. I think if we’re going to do it, I think it’s - you know, they should burden share more fairly. It’s not fair for the United States to defend many countries - not only that country, but many countries where we - and they’re rich countries. I could tell you there’s five other countries that I’ve had the same conversations with.\nYou know, Saudi Arabia - we moved more troops there. And they’re paying us billions of dollars. Okay? You never heard of that before. You’ve never heard of that in your whole life. We moved troops and we paid nothing. And people took advantage and the world took advantage of us. But we do - we have a good relationship with Saudi Arabia, but they needed help. They were attacked. And, as you saw, we just moved a contingent of troops, and they’re paying us billions of dollars and they’re happy to do so.\nThe problem is nobody ever asked them to do it until I came along. Nobody ever asked. Obama didn’t ask. Bush didn’t ask. Clinton didn’t ask. Nobody asked. In fact, they said to me, “But nobody has ever asked us to do this.” I said, “I know, King, but I’m asking.”\nAnd they’re paying us - they’ve already sent us billions of dollars. It’s already in the bank. So - and that’s right. And they’re happy to do it. But we never had a President who would ask. And it’s not right. So - and we have many other countries that were doing the same thing - wealthy countries.\nNow, in some cases, you have countries that need help that don’t have money. They’re poor and there’s tremendous trauma. There’s tremendous problems and things going on that shouldn’t be going on. And that’s a different situation.\nBut we have wealthy countries - I’ve asked Japan. I said to Prime Minister Abe - a friend of mine, Shinzo. I said, “You have to - you have to help us out here. We’re paying a lot of money. You’re a wealthy nation. And we’re, you know, paying for your military, essentially. You have to help us out.” And he’s doing - he’s going to do a lot. They’re all going to do a lot. But they were never asked. Now they’re being asked.\nQ Sir, do think you’ll be able to get a China trade deal by the end of the year?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I think it’s a very important point. You understand. I mean, it’s a point nobody probably really knows about. I don’t talk about it, but this is the first time I’ve talked about it publicly. But, no, South Korea is paying us almost $500 million more. And now we’re starting a negotiation for millions of dollars.\nQ In those recent talks with the King of Saudi Arabia that you just referenced -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, very recent.\nQ - did you bring up the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the American?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we’ve had that discussion and we’ve had it many times. And they, you know - I mean, you know their position; you know my position, too. Yeah. It’s always - it’s brought up. But, you know, we - I also brought up - and I’ll bring it up right now - the fact that Iran is killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people, right now, as we speak. That’s why they cut off the Internet. So, they cut off the Internet so people can’t see what’s going on.\nBut thousands of people are being killed in Iran right now. And, frankly, I don’t know how you get in there; I don’t know how you do your business - but the press ought to get in there and see what’s going on because the word is that thousands of people are being killed in Iran that are protesting. And you’re hearing that, too. Not just -\nQ Mr. President -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Not just small numbers, which are bad; big numbers, which are really bad, and really big numbers.\nQ Mr. President, is there something you want to do about that - about those killings in Iran? Is there anything more that you can do, that the United States can do?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I’d rather not say right now. But I think it’s a terrible thing that I think the world has to be watching. But many people are being killed. You’re hearing that, too. Many, many people are being killed in Iran right now for protesting - for the mere fact that they are protesting. It’s a terrible thing.\nQ Harry Dunn’s family is demanding that the U.S. diplomat’s wife return to the UK. Will you do that?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: You’re talking about the woman who had the accident with the young man on the motorcycle?\nQ Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, you know, I had his parents up, and they’re lovely people. And I’ve spoken to the woman, who works for government, who has diplomatic immunity. And we’re trying to work something out.\nQ Mr. President, on the China trade deal, sir? Do you think you’ll be able to get it by the end of the year? Is that your goal?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Let me tell you, the China trade deal is dependent on one thing: Do I want to make it? Because we’re doing very well with China right now and we can do even better with the flick of a pen. And China is paying for it. And China has their worst year, by far, that they’ve had in 57 years. So, we’ll see what happens. But we’re doing very well, right now. And I gave the farmers, as you know, $28 billion and had a lot left over.\nBecause the farmers were targeted by China. I gave them $28 billion over a two-year period, and that got them whole. That was everything that China took out. I gave them from the tariffs that China paid us, and I had billions left over - many billions left over.\nQ So you don’t really have a deadline?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I have no deadline. No.\nQ Mr. President, are you concerned about the -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: In some ways, I think it’s better to wait until after the election, you want to know the truth. I think, in some ways, it’s better to wait until after the election with China.\nQ But why? Why is that, sir?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: But I - I’m not going to say that. I just think that. I’ll just tell you: In some ways, I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal. But they want to make a deal now. And we’ll see whether or not the deal is going to be right. It’s got to be right.\nLook, China has been ripping off the United States for many, many years. Again, because of leadership, or lack of leadership, or it wasn’t their thing. It’s like I told you about the military and the kind of money we’re taking in. And, you know, every one of these countries - these are rich countries I’m talking to. They would always say, “But nobody has ever asked us to do that.” Like, “Therefore, why should we do it now?”\nI said, “Well, they haven’t because they were foolish, but I am.” And that’s where we are. And that’s why - with Saudi Arabia, with South Korea, with so many other countries - they’re paying a lot of money to the United States that they weren’t paying. And they will be paying a lot more.\nQ Mr. President, do you think that Jeremy Corbyn needs to -\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: That’s a big story. Right? That’s a big story, you.\nQ A lot of big stories.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I don’t know - I don’t how you can make that a bad one. But you’ll figure a way, right?\nQ Do you think that Jeremy Corbyn needs to do more to denounce anti-Semitism?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I know nothing about the gentleman, really - Jeremy Corbyn. Know nothing about him.\nQ Do you have a comment on Prince Andrew stepping -\nQ Mr. President, do you think that NATO should strengthen the dialogue with Russia? French President Emmanuel Macron is asking to talk more to Russia. Do you support him?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I think NATO should always be in dialogue with Russia. I think you can have a very good relationship with Russia. I don’t think that there is any problem at all with the Secretary General speaking with Russia. I think it’s a very important thing to do.\nSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: And, actually, we are talking to Russia because I strongly also, as the President, believe in the importance of having dialogue with Russia. Russia is our biggest neighbor and Russia is here to stay, and we will strive for a better relationship with Russia. But we do that based on what we call the dual-track approach by NATO. We have to be strong and we have to provide a credible deterrence and defense, combined with dialogue.\nSo, for us, it is deterrence, defense, and dialogue, and that’s exactly what we are doing, especially when it comes to arms control. We need to avoid a new arms race. We need to avoid a new Cold War. A new arms race is dangerous. It is expensive. And therefore, we also very much that Russia has violated the INF Treaty, which banned all of the intermediate-range missiles in Europe.\nThe good thing is that NATO was able to respond in a unified way. We all agreed that Russia was in violation. We all supported the U.S. decision, because a treaty will not work if it’s only respected by one side.\nAnd now we sit together again - North America, Europe, U.S., and the rest of the NATO Allies - and address how should we respond. We will respond in a coordinated way. Together, we will respond in a defensive way. But we have to make sure that we still provide credible deterrence and defense also in a world with more Russian missiles in Europe.\nArms control is something I know that the President is very focused on. I really would like to see progress on arms control with Russia. But also, in one way, we will have to find ways to include China. Because, in the future, China has to be part of the arms control efforts.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: And I have to say this: Russia wants to make a deal on arms control. And I terminated the deal because they weren’t living up to it. And it was an obsolete deal anyway. They weren’t living up to it.\nBut Russia wants to make a deal. As recently as, like, two weeks ago, Russia wants to make a deal very much on arms control and nuclear. And that’s smart. And so do we. We think it would be a good thing.\nAnd we’ll also certainly bring in, as you know, China. And we may bring them in later, or we may bring them in now. But Russia wants to do something badly and so do we. It would be a great thing to do.\nQ Mr. President, do you have a comment on Prince Andrew stepping down from his royal duties?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: On who?\nQ Prince Andrew stepping down from his royal duties.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: No. I don’t know Prince Andrew. But it’s a - that’s a tough story. That’s a very tough story. I don’t know him. No.\nOkay. Anybody else? Thank you. So we’ll see you during the next two days. Interesting, right? Huh? A lot of money. A lot of money. Okay. Bye, folks.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Trump’s 2025 joint session address, fact checked and annotated\nAmericans are reeling from the early weeks of Trump 2.0, and President Donald Trump got a prime-time chance to explain the fast and furious start to his return to power in an address to a joint session of Congress.\nHe made the case for the trade wars he’s started with Canada and Mexico, defended his effort with Elon Musk to downsize and remake American government, and faced loud opposition and heckling from Democrats, one of whom was removed from the chamber.\nRead Trump’s speech, annotated with context and fact checks, below.\nThank you very much. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the first lady of the United States, the members of the United States Congress. Thank you very much. And to my fellow citizens, America is back.\nJohnson and Vance behind Trump are a visual representation of the hold Republicans have on Washington. Their House and Senate majorities are small, but they control every branch of power at the moment.\nSix weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\nIt sure has been swift and unrelenting. Agree with it or not, but Trump, working with Elon Musk at his Department of Government Efficiency, has set the pace to completely remake the US government and redefine the place of the US in the world order.\nWe have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years, or eight years, and we are just getting started.\nTrump will always say he’s accomplished more than anyone. He’s got a way to go to catch presidents like FDR.\nI return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. Our spirit is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.\nThe American dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed and perhaps will never witness again. There's never been anything like it.\nThe presidential election of November 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes.\nHe can claim a mandate, having won the popular vote, but it’s by no means historic. Rep. Al Green rose to yell at Trump when he said this and was shouted down by Republicans yelling “USA.”\nWe won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 — on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.\nNow, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. In fact, it's an astonishing record: 27-point swing — the most ever.\nActually, a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released this week found that just 39% of Americans said the country was moving in the right direction, compared with 45% who said it was moving in the wrong direction. That’s a drop from when Trump started his first term.\nLikewise, small-business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump.\nFrom CNN’s Daniel Dale: This claim needs context. If Trump was referring to the commonly cited NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, his claim about a 41-point increase appears to be a reference to one component — the percentage of small-business owners expecting the economy to improve. That measure did soar a net 41 percentage points from pre-election October to post-election November. Trump didn’t mention that the total index then declined in January, to a level that is still high but lower than it was under Trump in September 2020 and October 2020 — less than five years ago.\nRead more[interruption, Texas Rep. Al Green removed from chamber]\nJohnson warns Rep. Green by name before the sergeant at arms walks down the aisle and escorts him out of the chamber. Green, by the way, was among the first lawmakers calling for Trump’s impeachment during his first term, and has again called for Trump to be impeached even though he just recently took office.\nOver the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 executive orders and taken more than 400 executive actions — a record — to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I'm doing it.\nIt is an epic pace of executive orders. Some are more consequential than others. Track them all, sorted by general topic, here.\nIn fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency — it's our presidency — is the most successful in the history of our nation. And what makes it even more impressive is that, do you know No. 2 is? George Washington. How about that? I don't know about that list. But we'll take it.\nIt’s not clear who stated Trump’s presidency has been second only to George Washington’s in terms of success. Trump has now said it. He’s compared himself to George Washington before.\nWithin hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the US military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our country. And what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. Ever.\nFrom CNN’s Daniel Dale and Devan Cole: Trump claimed that, since taking office again, he has already achieved the lowest number of illegal border crossings “ever recorded.” That’s false. He could have accurately said the number of Border Patrol apprehensions at the southern border in February — the first full month of his second term — is the lowest in many decades, at least if it’s true that the number was 8,326, as he claimed on social media before the speech. But official federal statistics show there were fewer Border Patrol encounters with migrants at the southwest border in some of the months of the early 1960s.\nRead moreThey heard my words and they chose not to come — much easier that way. In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?\nFrom CNN’s Daniel Dale and Haley Britzky: There is no evidence for the president’s claim, which Trump’s own presidential campaign was unable to corroborate. (The campaign was unable to provide any evidence even for his narrower claim that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US.)\nRead moreThis is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I looked at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud — nothing I can do.\nAs Trump says Democrats will never stand and applaud him, cameras show some of them holding small signs that say things like, “Musk steals” and “false.”\nI could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what. Five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\nSo Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America. For the good of our nation, let's work together, and let's truly make America great again.\nA hallmark of Trump’s politics is that whenever he is in charge, he says things are great. And whenever Democrats are in charge, he says they are horrible.\nEvery day, my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs, to bring a future that America deserves, and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action. Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations and a freeze on all foreign aid.\nI terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization. And I also withdrew from the anti-American UN Human Rights Council.\nFrom CNN’s Ella Nilsen: This claim is inaccurate. Former President Joe Biden pledged to pay $11.4 billion per year toward international climate financing upon taking office. However, the US contribution to a global finance goal ended up being far lower because Congress appropriated less money than Biden’s goal. Biden’s State Department announced it had allocated $5.8 billion to international climate finance by 2022. US climate finance contributions have never reached trillions of dollars.\nRead moreTrump did indeed remove the US from international agreements and groups. He also removed the US from the Paris Climate Agreement during his first term. But Biden put the US back in.\nWe ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And, importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction.\nFrom CNN’s Bryan Mena: There has never been a federal mandate prohibiting Americans from buying gasoline-powered cars, which he claimed existed in his inaugural address. During the Biden administration, legislation was passed to support electric vehicles. Trump signed an executive order shortly after taking office in January seeking to reverse that. However, eliminating those policies may require congressional action.\nRead moreTo unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.\nWe ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job.\nMore than half of federal workers were already working from the office full- or part-time when Trump took office, but his requirement has been cited as an effort to cull the federal workforce.\nAnd we've ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. How did that work out? Not too good. Not too good.\nFrom CNN’s Daniel Dale and Devan Cole: That’s false. Trump’s two federal indictments were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. Smith was appointed in November 2022 by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee — but that is not proof that Biden was involved in the prosecution effort, much less that Biden personally ordered the indictments.\nRead moreAnd I've stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. It's back.\nAnd two days ago, I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.\nThe English as a national language and Gulf of America efforts can be tied together with a very clear racial overtone.\nI renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And likewise, I renamed, for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska, we love Alaska.\nWe've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government, and indeed the private sector, and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.\nThe anti-diversity initiatives are visible in the chamber. Trump removed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Q. Brown, a Black man; and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the chief of the Navy and first woman to serve on the Joint Chiefs, whom Hegseth had described as a “DEI hire.”\nWe believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. Very important.\nYou should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court, in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nWe have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.\nI also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports.\nThree years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete — one of the best — preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls’ volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Peyton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls’ team or they will lose all federal funding.\nAnd if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.\nWhat I've just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now, because of us, sweeping the entire world. Common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, ever going to let that happen.\nAs CNN’s John King said, “’Common sense’ is a Trump term for what others would call culture war: English as the official language, Gulf of America, Mount McKinley, transgender issues and so on. It plays well with his base, but those issues don't lower prices at the grocery store, so when he got there ... it is all blame Biden.”\nAmong my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.\nTrump may soon face criticism over inflation. The price of eggs has risen, in part because of avian flu, and he has imposed tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China.\nTheir policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans — they've never had anything like it.\nWe suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country — they're not sure. As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.\nJoe Biden, especially, let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg price is out of control, and we're working hard to get it back down.\nFrom CNN’s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Elisabeth Buchwald and Vanessa Yurkevich: The avian flu has caused egg prices to rise because the United States Department of Agriculture requires the culling of entire flocks to stop the spread if the virus is detected. It’s a practice that occurred during the Biden administration, but also one that is continuing under Trump as the virus continues to infect flocks nationwide. When Biden took office, the average price of a carton of a dozen grade A eggs across US cities was $1.47, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. By the time Biden left office in January, a carton of eggs cost $4.95 on average, a 2.7% increase from a year prior. Due to short supply, egg prices are projected to increase by 41.1% this year, according to the USDA’s food outlook as of February 25.\nRead moreSecretary, do a good job on that. You inherited a total mess from the previous administration. Do a good job.\nA major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95 percent, slowed pipeline construction to a halt and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now.\nAnd frankly, we have never seen anything like it. That's why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency.\nAs you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, by far. And now I've fully authorized the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.\nAll oil is not the same. CNN’s Ella Nilsen and Amy O’Kruk explained in a recent story how much of what the US can get at home might not help lower gas prices.\nMy administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska — among the largest in the world — where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. There's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go, the permitting is gotten. And later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.\nTo further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.\nAnd to that end, I have created the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE. Perhaps you've heard of it. Perhaps.\nWhich is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you Elon, you're working very hard. He didn't need this. He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.\nIs DOGE headed by Elon Musk? There have been conflicting reports.\nEverybody here, even this side, appreciates it, I believe. They just don't want to admit that.\nDemocrats have been criticized by Trump and others for not embracing Musk’s cuts, which Republicans describe as eliminating waste and fraud. But Democrats have also not been included in the process.\nJust listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified. $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens. $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma. $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of. $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro Colombian empowerment in Central America — $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender. This is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East. It's a program — $20 million for a program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee headed up — and we know she's involved — just at the last moment, the money was passed over — by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her?\nFrom CNN’s Deidre McPhillips: Trump’s claim is false. Between the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years, the National Institutes of Health awarded a total of $477,121 to three projects that involved administering feminizing hormone therapy to monkeys to understand how it may affect their immune system and make them more susceptible to HIV. It’s not clear where the $8 million figure came from or why Trump referenced studies in mice instead of monkeys.\nRead moreA $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali. $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City.\nIt has been difficult to confirm the details on many of these programs. DOGE has a very simple website that is not much more than a version of the group’s feed on Musk’s X social media platform.\n$250 thousand to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia. $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda. $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia. $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. Know what we're doing, we should use it ourselves.\nMost of what Trump mentioned is spending on foreign aid, although it is a fraction — around 1% — of the annual budget.\nAnd $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education — the most ever paid, nothing even like it.\nUnder the Trump administration, all of these scams — and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them, they're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people, headed up by Elon We appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.\nFrom CNN’s Casey Tolan: This figure, which is uncorroborated, needs context. Musk and other Trump allies have claimed DOGE’s work is aimed at targeting waste, fraud and abuse. But DOGE has not released evidence that the contracts it has canceled were fraudulent. And at least some of the cuts have been reversed amid criticism.\nRead moreAnd we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, a federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 million in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to.\nHere’s that GAO report. It’s a little more complicated than Trump suggests. There are distinct concepts — “improper payments” and “fraud” — that need to be considered.\nWe're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors, and that our seniors and people that we love rely on. Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security numbers from people aged 100 to 109 years old.\nFrom CNN’s Tami Luhby and Daniel Dale: The vast majority of these people do not have dates of death listed in Social Security’s database. But that doesn’t mean they are actually receiving monthly benefits. Public data from the Social Security Administration shows that about 89,000 people age 99 or over were receiving Social Security benefits in December 2024, not even close to the millions Trump invoked.\nRead moreIt lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You're going to find it.\nTrump has promised not to cut Social Security, but clearly feels that eliminating fraud is not a cut. He will need to prove there is fraud, and he’s asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute some people.\nBut a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security. It hurts our country. 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159, and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.\nIncluding, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229; one person between the age of 240 and 249; and one person is listed at 360 years of age, more than 100 years — more than 100 years older than our country. But we're gonna find out where that money's going, and it's not going to be pretty.\nBy slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.\nAnd today, interest rates took a beautiful drop — big, beautiful drop — it's about time. And in the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years: balance the federal budget — we're going to balance it.\nWith that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the gold card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million we will allow the most successful, job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to US citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated.\nTrump made his political name promising mass deportations of undocumented immigrants from mostly poor countries. Here he’s inviting the wealthy to buy access to the US.\nAnd these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came. The money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that, but they have to pay tax, create jobs.\nThey'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out — No. 1 at the top school, as an example — being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.\nSo while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration — the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country — we will now bring in brilliant, hard working job creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.\nAmericans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years, the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits and held back America's potential in every possible way.\nThe last president who oversaw a budget surplus was Bill Clinton, who did it with major prodding from Republicans in Congress. Recent annual budget deficits have been more than $1 trillion, although those included emergency spending and Trump’s first-term tax cuts.\nThe nation founded by pioneers and risk-takers now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get, instead take 10 years, 15 years and even 20 years before you're rejected. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again.\nAnd any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately. Because we are draining the swamp — it's very simple — and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.\nAnd the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there. They're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right — I don't mean the Republican right, but my right right here — I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office, so I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut.\nIt's a very, very big part of our plan. We had tremendous success in our first term with it — a very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board, and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation, I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.\nOne reason Trump needs to cut government spending is to pay for these additional tax cuts he has promised.\nAnd I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax-deductible, but only if the car is made in America.\nBy the way, we're gonna have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen — plants are opening up all over the place, deals are being made — never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? That, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today, all three, the top people, and they're so excited. In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.\nHonda announced it will produce the hybrid Civic in Indiana in order to avoid Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, according to Reuters.\nAnd this has taken place since our great victory on November 5, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country.\nIn addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing, and just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20, 2025, and it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term.\nIf you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff, and in some cases a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries.\nDuring the campaign Trump frequently talked about his love for the word tariff. Here he seems to be explaining it to Americans.\nOn average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada — have you heard of them? — and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them, and South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher — and we give so much help militarily and so many other ways to South Korea. But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. The system is not fair to the United States. It never was.\nThis is the meatiest portion of the speech so far. Trump is trying to build support for his tariffs, which alarm many Americans and also alarmed the stock market, which dropped this week.\nAnd so on April 2 — I wanted to make it April 1, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. That's what — that's not — just one day was cost us a lot of money. But we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in, and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal, back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.\nOr, perhaps this means countries have a little less than a month to negotiate.\nIf they do nonmonetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do nonmonetary barriers to keep them out of our market. There's a lot of that, too, they don't even allow us in their market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China, and I did it with others, and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because it was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it. We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer.\nFrom CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby: Trump’s claim needs context. Tariffs are paid by US importers, not foreign exporters, and it’s easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.\nRead moreMuch has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people — destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars, and the United States will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer.\nThanks to our America-first policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies that people of SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle — Larry Ellison — announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment — Tim Cook called me, he said, “I cannot spend it fast enough.” It's going to be much higher than that, I believe. They'll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount — 97% — of the market, announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth, right here in the USA.\nAnd we're not giving them any money. Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. All that meant to them. We're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs, so they came and they're building, and many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money. We just want to protect our businesses and our people. And they will come because they won’t have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act, and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt, or any other reason you want to.\nThe CHIPS Act, which was intended to build up a domestic semiconductor industry, was passed with bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate, and signed by Biden into law. Trump’s administration has been working to cancel some contracts.\nOur new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer — I love the farmer — who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you, because those goods that come in from other countries and companies. They're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting, and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.\nFarmers — or people in rural America — are part of Trump’s base of support. But they will be among those hurt most by his trade war.\nThe tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers, starting on April 2 — it may be a little bit of an adjustment period. We had that before, when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases, and I said, just bear with me. And they did. They did. Probably have to bear with me again, and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases, and we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers, but our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you, too.\nAnd I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel, because, if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military, and frankly, we just won't have a country very long.\nHere today is a proud American steel worker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years, provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great job.\nHats off to Jeff.\nThank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance. We're okay with that. It won't be much.\nEconomists aren’t so sure the disturbance will be so “little” from these tariffs. They could impact everyday Americans to the tune of $1,200 per year, and that’s before the reciprocal tariffs Trump promised in this speech.\nAnd look, and look where Biden took us. Very low, the lowest we've ever been. Jeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care, community. She works so hard on it. You're a very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States.\nMelania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce. Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women, very impressive: Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the first lady's Fostering the Future initiative, and is poised to complete her education and become a teacher; and Elliston Berry, who became a victim of an illicit deepfake image produced by a peer. With Elliston's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and — this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much.\nDeepfakes are a major problem.\nAnd thank you to John Thune and the Senate, great job, to criminalize the publication of such images online — just a terrible, terrible thing — and once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind. Because nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\nThat's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.\nBut if we truly care about protecting Americans' children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world. Because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies, they are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast.\nIt’s surprising that Trump waited this long into the speech to talk about his deportation efforts. His administration has struggled to work as fast as Trump would like. In fact, the pace of deportation flights so far has not been much different from that under Biden in 2024, according to data analyzed by CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez and Renée Rigdon.\nAnd I want to thank Tom Homan, and Kristi, I want to thank you. And Paul of Border Patrol, I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody, Border Patrol, ICE. Well, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.\nLast year, a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student named Laken Riley — the best in her class, admired by everybody — went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning, Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized and horrifically murdered. Laken was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border, and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration — it was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat run sanctuary city — a disaster — before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, are Laken's beloved mother, Allyson, and her sister, Lauren.\nRiley’s death was a major campaign issue for Republicans, and passing the Laken Riley Act, which requires certain migrants to be detained when accused of a crime, was a major victory for Trump and Republicans.\nLast year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. It's very strong, powerful act.\nIt's called the Laken Riley Act, so Allyson and Lauren, America will never ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley.\nThank you very much.\nSince taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history, and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you.\nThe media and our friends in the Democrat party kept saying, \"We needed new legislation. We must have legislation to secure the border,\" but it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.\nJoe Biden didn't just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption, like nobody's ever seen before — beautiful towns destroyed. Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America.\nSpringfield is the place where Trump and Vance falsely insisted Haitian refugees were eating dogs and cats. It wasn’t true.\nBut there still is much work to be done. Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray, from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last year, Alexis' 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela, released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border. The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly.\nJocelyn Nungaray’s death was also a campaign issue.\nAlexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. Earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much — she loved nature. Across Galveston Bay from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent National Wildlife Refuge; a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures, on the edge of the Gulf of America. Alexis, moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. So Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much.\nTrump’s signing of an order during the joint address to Congress seems like it must be a first.\nAll three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang — the toughest gang, they say, in the world — known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations.\nThey are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that's not good for them.\nCountless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the US by the Biden administration, but now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country, or if they're too dangerous, put in jails standing trial in this country because we don't want them to come back ever.\nWith us this evening is a warrior on the front lines of that battle, Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz — great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande, near an area known as Cartel Island — doesn't sound too nice to me — when heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them. Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed, in great danger and he leapt into action, returning fire and and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety — and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event, and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and for your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed, we honor you and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much.\nThere was a major standing ovation for Ortiz, who teared up.\nAnd I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation, posing a great threat to our national security. The cartels are waging war on America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels, which we are doing.\nFive nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them — think of this — handed over to us, 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever.\nLearn more about Rafael Caro Quintero and the 28 other alleged criminals extradited to the US from Mexico.\nBut we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done. They have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the USA. They're going to stop it.\nTrump has overstated the amount of fentanyl coming into the US from Canada. It is a fraction of what authorities seize.\nI have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history — larger even than current record-holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man, but someone who believed very strongly in borders.\nTrump is referring to Eisenhower’s horribly named “Operation Wetback.”\nAmericans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you. Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let's get it to me, I'll sign it so fast, you won't even believe it.\nRepublicans will have to coalesce around a government spending bill to deliver this funding to Trump. They have an extremely small majority in the House and Democrats are unlikely to help them.\nAnd as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics. Many jurisdictions virtually seized, enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law, starting at the FBI and the DOJ. Pam, good luck. Kash, wherever you may be, good luck. Good luck.\nTrump’s first-term FBI Director, Chris Wray, had years left on his 10-year term, but Trump made clear he wanted Patel for the job. Patel, a conspiracy theorist, was among Trump’s more controversial nominees.\nThey've already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. We're also, once again, giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they so dearly deserve — they have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is, the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.\nRepublicans generally support police, but Trump’s pardon of January 6 rioters who attacked Capitol Police complicates that.\nThis also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and we'll never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers so I have no choice.\nOne year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller — unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer — was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to this funeral. The vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests, and they were rough arrests, he was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. I attended officer Diller's service, and when I met his wife and 1-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow's name is Stephanie, and she is here tonight. Stephanie, thank you very much, Stephanie.\nStephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero, New York's finest, and we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets, and we're going to do it fast. Got to stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head — back of the head — with baseball bats. We got to get them out of here. I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer, and tonight I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\nI'm also asking for a new crime bill, getting tough on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed.\nJoining us at the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is DJ Daniel, he is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer.\nDJ was dressed in a police uniform and was held up to applause.\nBut in 2018, DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true, and DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer — actually a number of times. Peace. The police love him. The police departments love them. And tonight, DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States Secret Service.\nIt was a touching moment when DJ hugged the Secret Service director. Trump has elevated the showmanship associated with guests at these presidential addresses.\nThank you, DJ. DJ's doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new Presidential Commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nWith the name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.\nOur goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago — and you can't even believe these numbers — one in 10,000 children had autism, one in 10,000, and now it's one in 36. There's something wrong — one in 36, think of that — so we're going to find out what it is. And there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you, you have the best, to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby? Good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you.\nKennedy, of course, has questioned whether vaccines are to blame, although that theory has been debunked. As HHS secretary, he has said he wants to see more evidence about vaccines. Trump’s portrayal of the rise in autism rates is also distorted.\nMy administration is also working to protect our children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband, while encouraging her daughter to use a new name and pronouns — they/them pronouns actually — all without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you.\nStories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology.\nI also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth.\nAnd now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children, and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie.\nThis type of law would likely not be able to pass through the Senate as long as the filibuster exists.\nAnd our message to every child in America is that you are perfect, exactly the way God made you.\nBecause we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it's already out, and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is troubled. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it, don't we? Don't we feel better?\nAs Trump says “wokeness” is gone from the military, the camera panned to top generals, all of whom are now White men.\nOur service members won't be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country. And Pete, congratulations. Secretary of defense, congratulations. And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.\nI am pleased to report that in January, the US Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years, and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference.\nAnd you know it was just a few months ago, where the results were exactly the opposite; we couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now having the best results just about that we've ever had, what a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see people love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.\nWe're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy, when he was just a boy, and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete — a really good athlete, they say; a brilliant student with a 4.46 — that's good — GPA. And his greatest dream is to attend the US Military Academy at West Point.\nAnd Jason, that's a very big deal getting in, that's a hard one to get into, but I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You will soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.\nThat makes Jason’s year, clearly. Getting into West Point is hard!\nJason, you're going to be on the long gray line, Jason. As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art golden dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland, all made in the USA.\nRonald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places, they have it. Israel has it, other places have it. And the United States should have it, too, right? Tim, right? They should have it too. So I want to thank you — but it's a very, very important — this is a very dangerous world, we should have it. We want to be protected and we're going to protect our citizens like never before.\nOne major difference between Israel and the US is size. CNN recently reported on the effort to make a missile defense shield over Guam, which is facing obstacles.\nTo boost our defense-industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding.\nAnd for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs. We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact. To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.\nJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.\nBlackRock is the company buying ports on either side of the canal from Hong Kong.\nThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure — 38,000 workers died building the Panama canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes — not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25 percent chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history, if you bring it up to modern-day costs.\nFrom CNN’s Daniel Dale: Trump repeated his false claim that 38,000 Americans died during the building of the Panama Canal. That figure is not even close to true, experts on the canal’s construction say.\nRead moreIt was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\nAnd we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Now, Marco has been amazing and he's going to do a great job. Think of it — he got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman — and I feel very certain — so let's assume he got 100 votes. And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it. But he's already proven — I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate your voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job.\nThank you. Thank you. He's doing a great job. Great job.\nAnd I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future. And if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America. We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it.\nIf Trump obtains Greenland and the Panama Canal, it will signal a new period of American expansion, something that has not occurred since the early 20th century.\nBut we need it really for international world security. And I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it. We will keep you safe. We will make you rich, and together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but a very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.\nWhat Greenlanders want is an open question. CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan traveled there in February to talk to residents about joining the US.\nAmerica is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism. Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing, it was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.\nFamilies of some of the service members killed at Abbey Gate have been major backers of Trump. They appeared with him at the Republican National Convention.\nTonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\nAnd I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families, who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered and the many people that were so badly — over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan. What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, \"Wow, maybe this is my chance.\"\" That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.\nI spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. Just spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. As happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter, was killed for no reason whatsoever.\nIn the Middle East we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations, the Abraham Accords. And now we're going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.\nInterestingly, Trump did not mention his controversial and seriously out-of-the-box idea to displace Palestinians and turn Gaza into a sort of Riviera.\nA lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven’t been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on, with Ukraine and Russia. But a lot of things are happening in the Middle East — it's a rough neighborhood, actually.\nI'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight. The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense, with no security, with no energy.\nDo you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say — Pocahontas says \"yes.\"\n“Pocahontas” is Trump’s insulting nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She applauded at his comment.\nTwo thousand people are being killed every single week — more than that. They're Russian young people, they're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans, but I want it to stop. Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine, by far. Think of that. They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending. And we've spent perhaps $350 billion, like taking candy from a baby, that's what happened. And they've spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don't. But we're getting along very well with them, and lots of good things are happening.\nTrump keeps using the $350 billion figure, but the US has actually spent much less than that. Also, the US has spent less than Europe, according to the Kiel Institute, which has tracked Ukraine aid.\nBiden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let's equalize. You got to be equal to us. But that didn't happen.\nEarlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. The letter reads, \"Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer.\" \"Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" he said. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\"\nTrump yelled at Zelensky in the Oval Office less than a week ago; this week, he paused US military aid to Ukraine. Trump has clearly pivoted toward Russia and away from Europe, but news of Zelensky’s letter is a major development.\nI appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful?\nIt's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\nNearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Marc Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. Rough stuff.\nThe US released a Russian money launderer in exchange for Fogel.\nThe previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin. But last summer I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that, and they are here tonight.\nTo Marc and his great mom, we are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.\nAs fate would have it, Marc Fogel was born in a small rural town — in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally. That was not pleasant.\nAnd that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage.\nAnd I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did, did I? Never forgot.\nLess than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.\nMy life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky.\nThe story of Trump’s near-assassination is incredible.\nCorey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector.\nWhen the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body.\nCorey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs. Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors — we thought they were gone, and they were saved, so those doctors had great talent — we’re joined by Corey's wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allyson and Kaylee.\nThank you.\nTo Helen, Allyson and Kaylee, Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot.\nIt was love like Corey's that built our country, and it’s love like Corey's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before. I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that.\nMany of his supporters agree that he survived through divine intervention.\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nThank you very much.\nFrom the patriots of Lexington and Concord to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy; from the warriors who crossed the Delaware to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies; and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk to the astronauts who touched the moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.\nAnd as we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people.\nTrump veers away from the insults, division and campaign speech language he dished out earlier in the speech to end on an inspiring note.\nDespite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it till death.\nWe will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.\nOur ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier.\nThey chased our destiny across a boundless continent.\nThey built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge.\nThey lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel.\nWe stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age.\nThese workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities.\nThese warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\nNow it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty. And it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country.\nThis will be our greatest era. With God's help over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher.\nAnd we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.\nWe are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world.\nWe are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond.\nWhen he said Mars, there was a yell of approval. Elon Musk? Trump’s first term was marked by an effort to return to the moon. Musk would prefer to focus on Mars.\nAnd through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in, and for the country our people deserve.\nMy fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future because the golden age of America has only just begun.\nIt will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

First, almost all participants confirmed that they were broadly comfortable with the characterization of the contingent outlook for asset purchases that was presented in the June postmeeting press conference and in the July monetary policy testimony. Under that outlook, if economic conditions improved broadly as expected, the Committee would moderate the pace of its securities purchases later this year. And if economic conditions continued to develop broadly as anticipated, the Committee would reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps and conclude the purchase program around the middle of 2014. At that point, if the economy evolved along the lines anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward the Committee's 2 percent objective. While participants viewed the future path of purchases as contingent on economic and financial developments, one participant indicated discomfort with the contingent plan on the grounds that the references to specific dates could be misinterpreted by the public as suggesting that the purchase program would be wound down on a more-or-less preset schedule rather than in a manner dependent on the state of the economy. Generally, however, participants were satisfied that investors had come to understand the data-dependent nature of the Committee's thinking about asset purchases. A few participants, while comfortable with the plan, stressed the need to avoid putting too much emphasis on the 7 percent value for the unemployment rate, which they saw only as illustrative of conditions that could obtain at the time when the asset purchases are completed. get accutane australia ezyreg A whole week, that’s a bit to much.

Prior to the ACA, high rates of uninsurance were prevalent due to unaffordability and exclusions based on preexisting conditions. Additionally, some insured people faced extremely high out-of-pocket (OOP) costs and coverage limits. The ACA aimed to address these issues, though it did not eliminate all of them.\nThe ACA affects virtually all aspects of the health system, including insurers, providers, state governments, employers, taxpayers, and consumers. The law built on the existing health insurance system, making changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and employer-sponsored coverage. A fundamental change was the introduction of regulated health insurance exchange markets, or Marketplaces, which offer financial assistance for ACA-compliant coverage to those without traditional insurance sources. This chapter has a special focus on these Marketplaces that are integral to the ACA’s framework.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Private health coverage is subject to significant requirements at the state and federal levels. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 ushered in many new requirements for the federal regulation of private health coverage, another federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), has for over 50 years regulated the most predominant form of health coverage for people under age 65, employer-sponsored coverage.\nStates have traditionally been the primary regulators of health insurance, and state health insurance protections continue to play a major role alongside a growing list of federal protections aimed at addressing a variety of consumer concerns, including access to coverage, affordability, and adequacy. This chapter describes the landscape of laws and regulations that address health care coverage and the complicated interactions between state and federal requirements that can make these protections challenging for consumers to navigate. In this chapter, it is not possible to cover every single state and federal requirement for private plans, so the focus is on the primary laws and regulations that apply to private insurance coverage.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Details\nTranscript\nAlitia Faccone:\nWelcome to We get work™ and The Year Ahead 2024 podcast series. Covering workplace issues from both subject matter and industry perspectives, the 19 episodes in our series provide both big picture trends and detailed tactics that can help employers achieve their workplace ideal, while remaining real about regulations, compliance challenges, and more in 2024. Jackson Lewis invites you and others at your organization to experience the report's legislative, regulatory, and litigation insights in full at our website, JacksonLewis.com, or listen to the podcast series on whichever platform you turn to for compelling content.\nMelissa Ostrower:\nHello everyone, and thank you for joining us for this special episode of We get work™ for The Year Ahead 2024 report. Today we're talking about family forming benefits including fertility, surrogacy and adoption benefits, and I'm here with my partner Kellie Thomas, who is going to be providing very helpful information about this topic. Kellie, would you like to introduce yourself?\nKellie Thomas:\nSure, thanks Melissa. I've been at Jackson Lewis since about 2015, and when I came here I started to really delve into the health and welfare plan world. But over the last few years, as we've seen a pretty active job market, we've gotten a lot of calls from clients looking for new ways to incentivize and retain employees. And one of the biggest ways that they've been doing that is with these family forming benefits. So I'm happy to be here today to talk about them.\nMelissa Ostrower:\nThank you. So Kellie, as the firm leader in fertility adoption and surrogacy benefits, what would you say was the top trend in this area in 2023 and what are you anticipating will be the top trend in 2024? Don't worry, I know you don't have a crystal ball, but just based on your experience last year.\nKellie Thomas:\nAbsolutely. So I would say the first thing that we've really started to see an increase of is a change in health plan benefits from what we would call strictly infertility benefits to fertility benefits. And what I mean by that is infertility benefits traditionally have been the sort of benefits, IVF, IUI, things like that, that employers will cover when an employee has a medical diagnosis of infertility, which generally requires a male and a female and 12 months of trying and not successfully having a child.\nKellie Thomas:\nAs part of just an overall move that we see toward new DEI efforts, that type of thing, a more inclusive workplace, now we're seeing fertility benefits which basically don't require that diagnosis. And so they can be utilized by say a single woman who wants to have a baby on her own, same sex couples, that type of thing. So it covers the same types of procedures and medications, that type of thing, but without that diagnosis.\nKellie Thomas:\nSo that's probably the number one thing that I've really seen evolving over the last few years. And those are benefits specifically that are sometimes offered just directly through an employer's health plan, but there are also ways to structure it so that it can be offered as a benefit that's integrated with, but still separate from the employer group health plan.\nKellie Thomas:\nAlong with that, there's also an increase in other tax favored benefits. So for example, qualified adoption assistance plans that allow employers to reimburse set amount of adoption expenses on a tax favored basis, surrogacy benefits. And as a side note to our discussion here, even tax favored tuition benefits, which we've been seeing a lot of requests for. So I think it's just a general theme of employers looking for a way to reach out and benefit people in their whole lives through their benefit packages.\nMelissa Ostrower:\nThank you. Very interesting. So I'm sure a lot of employers are listening to this and really getting excited, but they might be thinking, \"What types of laws are implicated when offering these benefits? Are there things I need to think about that I may not have thought about before?\"\nKellie Thomas:\nYeah, absolutely. And that's really the question of the hour because fertility in particular is a tricky one because if it's not offered in your regular group health plan, you're actually creating a new group health plan. And that's where employers get nervous because we start throwing all the acronyms at them. So there's ERISA, there's the Affordable Care Act, ACA, there's COBRA, there's HIPAA, basically everything you have to worry about generally for what you think of as your standard health plan can come into play for these fertility benefits.\nKellie Thomas:\nThere's also tax code implications for all three types of these family forming benefits. And so there are certain benefits under a fertility called an HRA, health reimbursement arrangement can be offered on a pre-tax basis, but not everything. And then qualified adoption expenses, same thing. We have the code to worry about, the internal revenue code. Surrogacy benefits are taxable, including some technical issues that we'll talk about in a minute that need to be considered. So the big statutes that everyone's worried about when it comes to employee benefit plans factor in one way or another to each of these benefits.\nMelissa Ostrower:\nThank you. Very interesting. So what are the traps that you like to highlight that employers should definitely consider before putting in this benefit or if they have this type of benefit in place making sure they're compliant?\nKellie Thomas:\nAbsolutely. So as I mentioned before, the biggest one is you don't want to create the inadvertent group health plan, which is a term I started using because it came up a lot when employers were putting travel benefits in place post the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs. And so we'd get these calls and usually a panicked HR person who would say, \"They just did a big announcement to the whole company that we're going to have this new travel benefit, but I didn't know about it. And how do we do this and how is it compliant?\"\nKellie Thomas:\nSo it's really the same considerations here. When an employer is paying medical expenses for an employee, their spouse or their dependents, that can create a group health plan. And so while there are certain fertility benefits that may fall outside of that medical care umbrella, just by way of example, long-term egg storage, when there's not a medical infertility diagnosis and certain other more discreet examples, most of what we think of as a fertility benefit is going to be medical care. So therefore you have the group health plan issue.\nKellie Thomas:\nThere are pretty strong penalties for non-compliance when you have a group health plan. The biggest one, the biggest sort of sludge hammer penalty, it can become under the ACA. If you have a fertility benefit HRA that's not integrated with your group health plan coverage, that actually violates ACA market reforms and that can be thousands of dollars a day for that type of violation. So these are absolutely benefits that can be fine and structured properly, but there are certain rules that we need to make sure are followed.\nKellie Thomas:\nOther things to think about, although certainly not quite as scary as the ACA market reform violations, but with qualified adoption expenses because you have a tax favored benefit, those non-discrimination rules under the code that we hear and talk about with certain other benefits also come into play. So that's generally referring to discrimination in favor of your more highly compensated employees. So often we have to structure those so that they're wider basis an employer may initially think of when they're structuring the benefit.\nKellie Thomas:\nAnd then under the surrogacy, it's a funny one, surrogacy benefits are taxable, but under code section 409A, which is one that makes everyone's toes curl when they talk about it, there are rules about taxable reimbursements. And so if you're structuring your surrogacy benefit to have a lifetime limit, you may inadvertently trip over that rule. That's one, just raise a flag on that one. There are ways we can work around that issue, but again, we just need to be careful on how the benefit is structured.\nMelissa Ostrower:\nThank you. Well, this is really helpful information. On the one hand, these benefits can be very helpful to employees and really fill a void and help attract and retain talent, but there also are quite a few compliance burdens, so to speak.\nKellie Thomas:\nAbsolutely.\nMelissa Ostrower:\nSo which types of employers do you think would want to consider implementing these types of benefits, given the compliance issues involved and there is some cost to setting up and making sure our plan is compliant?\nKellie Thomas:\nYeah, absolutely. The nice thing about these benefits is they can really work for an employer of any size. And the reason for that is it's relatively low cost to set these up, and I'll put them in the two different categories. It's a little more involved when you're putting a fertility benefit in place. There's more avenues you have to think about. Adoption and surrogacy in particular. You need a plan document, you need a structure and you need a way to administer it. And from a budget perspective, you can set your own reimbursement limits on these, really all three of them. And so it makes it easier to budget than certain other types of benefits because you can look at who is your population? What's your expected utilization rate? Where do you want to be in terms of overall costs, say on an annual basis? And you can back out from there to come up with a limit that you want to impose.\nKellie Thomas:\nThere's no minimum, you could have an adoption or surrogacy benefits that's $1,000 or something. So it doesn't have to be huge and you can try it out, you can adjust it on a go forward basis. And so I think that ease of setup and flexibility makes this really appealing. And as I mentioned before, it often not only these are requested by employees on a somewhat regular basis, and it does fit into a general message to employees that you are thinking about your workforce in an inclusive way.\nMelissa Ostrower:\nThank you, Kellie. And as a final question, for those employers listening right now who want to explore adding these benefits in 2024, what would you say is the first step that they should undertake in doing so?\nKellie Thomas:\nI would say definitely call us. So I do think really getting ahead of these issues is always much easier than chasing them. So we can help with design, overall design and documentation. And then usually you're going to want to pull in a third party administrator to help you administer the benefits. There are three main players in the market right now. We're familiar with their agreements, we're familiar with their documents, and we can work within that structure to help put this benefit into place.\nKellie Thomas:\nAnd we do recommend, so particularly fertility benefits, it's good to have an outside claims administrator. If you think through it, you don't necessarily want, say your HR folks getting people's medical information and making claims decisions. And so these companies can handle that. They can offload that burden for you, so they would be able to handle those.\nMelissa Ostrower:\nPerfect. Well, thank you so much, Kellie. This information was very helpful and informative. So to all of you listeners, please feel free to reach out to Kellie Thomas, me, Melissa Ostrower, or any other member of our group here at Jackson Lewis, and we would be happy to talk about these issues or any other benefits issues you have. Happy 2024 everyone.\nKellie Thomas:\nThank you.\nMelissa Ostrower:\nThank you.\nAlitia Faccone:\nThank you for joining us for The Year Ahead 2024 special edition podcast series.

They represent 19% of the labor force and work in all industries and sectors. This economic relevance comes at a time when the Trump administration has announced policies to end some immigration programs and, consequently, work authorizations for various immigrants. In addition, other groups like Dreamers remain in limbo while the courts rule on the legality of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows them to reside and work legally in the country.\nFrom an economic perspective, it is important to know how many immigrants could lose their work authorization before the end of the year and how that would affect the U.S. economy. We estimate that the number could surpass 2 million. This fact sheet will provide a quick overview of the different groups facing either an imminent or potential revocation of their respective work authorizations.\nCuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) Parole Program\nOn March 25, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the revocation of humanitarian parole protections for individuals covered under the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) parole program, a policy that had provided temporary legal status and work authorization to people fleeing instability in these countries. This decision sparked widespread concern, as it threatened to leave over 530,000 CHNV parolees in the United States without lawful means of employment and vulnerable to deportation. The move was part of broader policy changes targeting immigration programs deemed by the administration as overly permissive.\nHowever, advocacy groups and legal experts quickly mounted challenges, arguing that the termination of the program violated statutory protections and procedural requirements. On April 15, in response to a lawsuit filed by immigrant rights organizations, a Federal Court issued an injunction, effectively blocking the Trump administration from ending the CHNV parole program. The court emphasized the need for proper justification and adherence to legal standards before dismantling such a critical program, underscoring the potential humanitarian and economic consequences of its abrupt termination.\nThe Trump administration appealed the decision before the Supreme Court, seeking to lift the injunction and proceed with the termination of the CHNV parole programs. On May 30, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing it to pause the CHNV program temporarily.\nTemporary Protected Status (TPS)\nTPS is a government protection that allows eligible foreign-born individuals to temporarily work and live in the United States due to unsafe conditions in their countries of origin. Currently, the U.S. provides TPS protections to about 1,095,115 individuals from 16 countries. However, the Trump administration has ordered the termination of TPS protections for over 344,000 Venezuelans, 200,000 Haitians, 72,000 Hondurans, 8,000 Afghans, 4,000 Nicaraguans, 3,200 Cameroonians, and over 7,800 Nepalese. In addition, President Trump announced he is weighing whether to terminate TPS for over 50,000 Ukrainians.\nNotably, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on May 19 that the Trump administration can proceed with canceling Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans while legal challenges to the decision continue in lower courts. The ruling directly affects Venezuelans granted TPS in 2023, while a separate group of roughly 250,000 Venezuelans who received protections in 2021 will retain their status until it expires in September.\nFinally, it is essential to highlight that President Trump unsuccessfully worked to end TPS during his first administration. If he tries again to end TPS in his second term, around 1,095,115 work authorizations would be in jeopardy. Below is a list of the expiration dates of TPS designations.[1]\n| Designated Country | Required Arrival Date | Secretary’s Decision Due | Expiration Date | TPS Holders | TPS Eligible |\n| Venezuela (2023) | 07/31/2023 | 02/01/2025 | Termination effective on May 19, 2025* (pursuant to U.S. Supreme Court decision) | 248,775 | 472,000 |\n| Afghanistan | 09/20/2023 | 03/21/2025 | May 20, 2025 (termination effective on July 14, 2025) | 11,700 (~ May 2025) | 17,700 |\n| Cameroon | 10/05/2023 | 04/08/2025 | June 7, 2025 (termination effective on August 4, 2025) | 5,200 (~ June 2025) | 10,000 |\n| Nepal | 06/24/2015 | 04/25/2025 | June 24, 2025 (termination effective on August 5, 2025) | 12,700 (~ June 2025) | ~ 14,500 |\n| Haiti | 06/03/2025 | 06/04/2025 | August 3, 2025 (termination effective on September 2, 2025) | 348,187 (~ June 2025) | 474,000 |\n| Honduras | 12/30/1998 | 05/06/2025 | July 5, 2025 (termination effective on September 8, 2025) | 72,000 (~ July 2025) | ~ 76,000 |\n| Nicaragua | 12/30/1998 | 05/06/2025 | July 5, 2025 (termination effective on September 8, 2025) | 4,000 (~ July 2025) | ~ 4,000 |\n| Venezuela (2021) | 03/08/2021 | 07/12/2025 | Sept. 10, 2025 | 256,625 | 323,000 |\n| Syria | 01/25/2024 | 08/01/2025 | Sept. 30, 2025 | 3,750 | 8,200 |\n| South Sudan | 09/02/2023 | 09/03/2025 | Nov. 3, 2025 | 175 (~ 200) | ~ 280 |\n| Burma | 03/21/2024 | 09/26/2025 | Nov. 25, 2025 | 3,275 | 7,300 |\n| Ethiopia | 04/11/2024 | 10/13/2025 | Dec. 12, 2025 | 3,745 | 12,800 |\n| Yemen | 07/02/2024 | 01/02/2026 | March 3, 2026 | 1,975 | 4,000 |\n| Somalia | 07/12/2024 | 01/16/2026 | March 17, 2026 | 605 | 4,900 |\n| El Salvador | 03/09/2001 | 07/11/2026 | Sept. 9, 2026 | 174,190 | 232,000 |\n| Sudan | 03/01/2022 | 08/20/2026 | Oct. 19, 2026 | 1,635 | 3,950 |\n| Ukraine | 04/11/2022 | 08/20/2026 | Oct. 19, 2026 | 63,425 | 103,700 |\n.\nCBP One\nMigrants who were temporarily allowed to work and live in the United States by using an online app called CBP One have been ordered to leave the country immediately. The app, initially introduced as part of an effort to streamline the asylum-seeking process and reduce border congestion, provided a legal pathway for migrants to live and work temporarily in the U.S. This decision is expected to affect more than 900,000 people who have been allowed into the country using the CBP One app since January 2023.\nUniting for Ukraine\nUniting for Ukraine (U4U) is a streamlined process that provides Ukrainian nationals who have fled Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression opportunities to come to the U.S. Currently, there are over 240,000 Ukrainians who have benefited from the program. However, President Trump has announced that he is considering ending the program.\nStatus of Afghan Allies\nFollowing the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August 2021, approximately 200,000 Afghan nationals relocated to the United States under various immigration pathways. These individuals arrived through a combination of humanitarian parole, Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs), refugee admissions, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and asylum applications. The majority of Afghan evacuees—over 76,000—entered the U.S. under humanitarian parole through Operation Allies Welcome between July 2021 and March 2022. This status provided temporary legal entry and work authorization but did not offer a direct path to permanent residency. Many parolees have since applied for asylum or SIVs to secure more stable immigration status.\nIn addition, in March 2022, the Biden administration designated Afghanistan for TPS, allowing eligible Afghans to live and work in the U.S. temporarily. As of September 2024, over 9,000 Afghans were enrolled in TPS. However, in May 2025, the Trump administration announced the termination of TPS for Afghanistan, citing improved conditions in the country, with the designation set to expire on July 12, 2025.\nDespite these immigration avenues, a significant number of Afghan evacuees remain in legal limbo, lacking a clear path to permanent residency. Advocacy groups continue to urge Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would provide a streamlined process for these individuals to obtain lawful permanent status.\nSouth Sudanese Nationals\nThe immigration status and work authorizations of over 2,000 South Sudanese nationals residing in the United States remain uncertain following the Trump administration’s decision to revoke all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders. This action was taken in response to South Sudan’s failure to accept the repatriation of its citizens deported from the U.S. The U.S. government cited a specific incident where South Sudan initially accepted a deportee but later refused entry upon his arrival, claiming he was not a South Sudanese national, despite prior certification by their own embassy. South Sudanese officials have criticized the blanket visa revocation as unfair, arguing it was based on a single case of mistaken identity and does not reflect the country’s overall cooperation.\nDACA\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a policy that protects qualifying young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, temporarily shielding them from deportation and providing them work authorization with possible renewal every two years. Approximately 530,000 Dreamers are currently protected under DACA. However, in 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled against DACA, holding that the program was unlawful.\nAfter none of the parties in the case sought an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court by the May 20 extended deadline, the case is now back before the U.S. District Court Judge, who must modify his original order to comply with the Fifth Circuit’s decision. The Fifth Circuit determined that the work authorization component of DACA is unlikely to be lawful, but narrowed the injunction to apply just to the state of Texas. The Fifth Circuit’s decision would result in DACA’s protection from deportation and work authorization being available to those renewing and those applying for the first time in 49 states, with those in Texas only having access to protection from deportation.\nInternational Students\nIn recent months, the U.S. government has revoked over 1,600 student visas and terminated the SEVIS records[2] of over 4,700 international students,[3] often without prior notice or clear justification. These actions, initiated by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), respectively, have been based on vague or minor infractions, such as dismissed misdemeanor charges or non-criminal protest activities, leading to widespread uncertainty among students and universities. The abrupt terminations have resulted in immediate consequences for affected students, including loss of employment authorization, ineligibility for reentry into the U.S., and potential deportation. Legal challenges have prompted some courts to issue temporary restraining orders, restoring the SEVIS records of certain students.\nHowever, on April 25, the Trump administration announced a new policy to terminate student visas for multiple reasons. While international students are only allowed to work on campus before they graduate, most of them are eligible to work in the United States for up to 36 months after graduation through a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT). The revocation of student visas could potentially lead to a scarcity of highly educated talent in the country.\nConclusion\nThe Trump administration’s actions and announcements to end various immigration programs and work authorizations for different groups of immigrants are likely to create significant challenges for the U.S. economy, with implications for labor markets, industries, and communities. By limiting pathways for immigrants to live and work in the United States, these policies might exacerbate workforce shortages, disrupt economic stability, and hinder growth in sectors heavily reliant on immigrant labor.\n[1] The DHS Secretary can extend TPS after a review of country conditions. A decision concerning an extension must be made at least 60 days before the TPS designation is set to expire. The Secretary can extend the TPS designation for a six, 12 or 18-month period or decide to cancel the designation. TPS extensions only apply to those who already have TPS status. Foreign nationals who arrive after the designated start date (i.e. “required arrival date”) are only made eligible for status if TPS is newly re-designated for their country.\n[2] The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is the system that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses to maintain information on international students who come to the U.S. with F-1, M-1, or J-1 visas.\n[3] As of May 7, 2025.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

NPR fact-checks former President Trump\nThere were a host of false things that Donald Trump said during his hour-long news conference Thursday that have gotten attention.\nA glaring example is his helicopter emergency landing story, which has not stood up to scrutiny.\nBut there was so much more. A team of NPR reporters and editors reviewed the transcript of his news conference and found at least 162 misstatements, exaggerations and outright lies in 64 minutes. That’s more than two a minute. It’s a stunning number for anyone – and even more problematic for a person running to lead the free world.\nPoliticians spin. They fib. They misspeak. They make honest mistakes like the rest of us. And, yes, they even sometimes exaggerate their biographies.\nThe expectation, though, is that they will treat the truth as something important and correct any errors.\nBut what former President Trump did this past Thursday went well beyond the bounds of what most politicians would do.\nHere’s what we found, going chronologically from the beginning of Trump’s remarks to the end:\n1. “I think our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint…”\nThe U.S. economy has rebounded from the pandemic downturn more rapidly than most other countries around the world. Growth has slowed in recent months, but gross domestic product still grew at a relatively healthy annual clip of 2.8% in April, May and June – which is faster than the pace in three of the four years when Trump was president. — Scott Horsley, NPR chief economics correspondent\n2. “…from a safety standpoint, both gangs on the street…”\nWe don’t have great, up-to-date data on gang activity in the U.S., but violent crime trends offer a good glimpse into safety in the country. Nationally, violent crime – that includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault – has been trending way down after a surge in 2020, according to the most recent data from the FBI. That data is preliminary and incomplete, covering around three-quarters of the country, but other crime analysts have found similar trends. Crime levels, of course, vary locally: murders are down in Philadelphia, for instance, but up in Charlotte, N.C. — Meg Anderson, NPR National Desk reporter covering criminal justice\n3. “...and frankly, gangs outside of our country in the form of other countries that are, frankly, very powerful. They’re very powerful countries.”\nThe U.S. is not in the “most dangerous position” from a foreign-policy standpoint than ever before. Biden pulled troops out of Afghanistan in his first year in office — though the withdrawal itself was chaotic and a target of much criticism — and since then, U.S. troops have not been actively engaged in a war for the first time in 20 years. The U.S. is supporting Ukraine and Israel, of course, and has troops in Iraq and Syria, but they’re not fighting on any regular basis.\nWhat’s more, however, FBI Director Christopher Wray has said the greatest threat to the country is domestic extremism. And beyond organized groups the very definition of extremism is changing, as fringe ideologies move into the mainstream, and radicalization takes hold amongst parts of the populace. Consider: the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and the assassination attempt on Trump’s life, even with a motive that remains murky at best. Regardless, the call is coming from inside the house, domestic extremism experts warn. Many polls show a sobering degree of support for political violence to drive change. — Andrew Sussman, NPR supervising editor for national security\n4-5. “We have a lot of bad things coming up. You could end up in a Depression of the 1929 variety, which would be a devastating thing, took many years– took many decades to recover from it, and we’re very close to that.”\nThere is nothing to suggest that a 1930s style Depression is on the horizon for the United States. And the Depression did not take “many decades to recover from.” It ended during World War Two, in 1941. — Scott Horsley\n6. “And we’re very close to a world war. In my opinion, we’re very close to a world war.”\nNo serious person thinks that the U.S., Russia and China are about to start a world war. Right now, Russia appears to be having a hard time defending Russia, given Ukraine’s recent incursions. While there are concerns about things like the potential for regional conflagrations in the Middle East, only Trump is talking about world war. — Andrew Sussman\n7. “Kamala's record is horrible. She's a radical left person at a level that nobody's seen.”\nIt’s debatable how liberal Harris is. Some in California didn’t like her record on criminal justice and thought she was not progressive enough. She’s clearly liked by progressives and her voting scores as a senator are on the liberal end of the spectrum, but is she “radical left” and “at a level that nobody’s seen”? There are plenty of people alive and in history who would be considered far more liberal and more radical.\n8. “She picked a radical left man.”\nFew, if any, reasonable people would say Walz is a “radical left man.” He had a progressive record as governor with a Democratic legislature, but the things passed are hardly radical – free school lunch, protecting abortion rights, legalizing marijuana, restricting access to certain types of guns. All of these things have majority support from voters. What’s more, that “progressive” record ignores Walz’s first term as governor when he worked with Republicans because Democrats didn’t control the legislature. And it ignores Walz’s time as a congressman when he was considered a more moderate member given that he was from a district that had been previously held by a Republican.\n9. “He's going for things that nobody's ever even heard of. Heavy into the transgender world.”\nLast year, Walz championed and signed a bill that prevented state courts of officials from complying with child-removal requests, extraditions, arrests or subpoenas related to gender-affirming health care that a person receives or provides in Minnesota. “Heavy into the transgender world” is vague and misleading.\n10. “He doesn't want to have borders. He doesn't want to have walls.”\nWalz has never called for having no borders. He has voiced opposition to a wall because he doesn't think it will stop illegal immigration. He told Anderson Cooper on CNN, for example, that a wall \"is not how you stop\" illegal immigration He called for more border-control agents, electronics and more legal ways to immigrate.\n11. “He doesn't want to have any form of safety for our country.”\nTrump himself praised Walz’s handling of the aftermath of the George Floyd murder at the hands of a police officer. And it’s certainly hyperbole to say he “doesn’t want any form of safety for our country.” Walz served in the U.S. National Guard for 24 years, so clearly, he’s interested in the country having national security. And domestically, he’s never been a “defund the police” advocate. Walz opposed a ballot measure that would have gotten rid of minimum police staffing levels, for example. That angered advocates. He signed police reforms into law, but that does not prove wanting no safety.\n12. “He doesn't mind people coming in from prisons.”\nWalz has not said he wants people coming in from prisons. Trump is trying to tie his claim that other countries are sending prisoners to the United States to Democrats’ immigration policies.\n13. “And neither does she, I guess. Because she's not, she couldn't care less.”\nHarris has said a lot to the contrary of not caring about the levels of migrants coming across the border, let alone people coming in from prisons. In fact, when in Guatemala, she said her message for people thinking of immigrating to the United States was: \"Do not come. Do not come.\"\n14. “She's the border czar. By the way, she was the border czar, 100%. And all of a sudden, for the last few weeks, she's not the border czar anymore, like nobody ever said it.”\nHarris was never appointed “border czar.” That’s a phrase that was used incorrectly by some media outlets. Biden tasked Harris with leading the “diplomatic effort” with leaders in Central American countries, where many migrants are coming from.\nBiden said he wants Harris “to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help — are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.” He added that Harris “agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept — the returnees, and enhance migration enforcement at their borders — at their borders.”\nHarris herself that day spoke of “the need to address root causes for the migration that we’ve been seeing.”\n15. “We have a very, very sick country right now. You saw the other day with the stock market crashing. That was just the beginning. That was just the beginning.”\nThe stock market did not “crash.” The stock market fell sharply at the end of last week as investors fretted about a softening job market. This was amplified on Monday when Japan’s stock market tumbled 12%, sparking a selloff around the world. Stocks in Japan and elsewhere have since regained much of this ground, however. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 683 points on the day of Trump’s news conference. — Scott Horsley\n16. “Fortunately, we've had some very good polls over the last fairly short period of time.”\nMost good polls have shown Harris gaining not just nationally, but also in the swing states, though these same polls show a very close race.\n17. “Rasmussen came out today. We're substantially leading.”\nTrump is not substantially leading, and Rasmussen is viewed as one of the least credible pollsters in the country.\n18. “And others came out today that we're leading, and in some cases, substantially, I guess, MSNBC came out, or CNBC came out also, with a poll that was, you know, has us leading.”\nPolls have not shown substantial leads. CNBC had Trump leading by 2, unchanged from his 2-point lead in July.\n19. “And leading fairly big in swing states. In some polls, I'm leading very big in swing states… .”\nAgain, polls in swing states have shown a tightened race.\n20. “But as a border czar, she's been the worst border czar in history, in the world history.”\nVice President Harris was never asked to lead immigration policy. That’s the job of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Again, the term “border czar” was used inaccurately by some media outlets, and it’s a term conservatives have been using to attack her, in part, because she has only visited the Southern U.S. border a few times since 2021. But in reality, Harris was tapped by President Biden to address the root causes of migration. Her approach has focused on deterrence. She’s told migrants to not come to the U.S., and she has been able to secure more than $5 billion in commitments from private companies to help boost the economy in Central American countries. — Sergio Martínez-Beltrán, NPR immigration correspondent based in Texas\n21. “I think the number is 20 million, but whether it's 15 or 20, it's numbers that nobody's ever heard before. 20 million people came over the border in the last– during the Biden-Harris administration. Twenty-million people. And it could be very much higher than that. Nobody really knows what the number is.”\nIt’s unclear where Trump is getting this number from. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, since 2021 agents have had more than 7.3 million encounters nationwide with migrants trying to cross into the country illegally. Under Biden, unlawful crossings hit an all-time high last year, but that number has decreased significantly, in part, due to Biden’s asylum restrictions at the Southern U.S. border. An April report from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics found there’s nearly 11 million unauthorized migrants in the country. — Sergio Martínez-Beltrán\n22. “Just like far more people were killed in the Ukraine-Russia war than you have reported.”\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine is revealing its own casualty figures, so there are only very broad estimates. — Andrew Sussman\n23. “A lot of great things would have happened, but now you have millions and millions of dead people. And you have people dying financially, because they can't buy bacon; they can't buy food; they can't buy groceries; they can't do anything. And they're living horribly in our country right now.”\nGrocery prices actually jumped sharply during Trump’s last year in office, as pandemic lockdowns disrupted the food supply chain and Americans were suddenly forced to eat more of their meals at home. Grocery inflation in June 2020 hit 5.6%. This was masked, however, by a plunge in other prices, as the global economy fell into pandemic recession.\nAs the economy rebounded, prices did, too. Inflation began to rise in 2021, and spiked in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent food and energy prices soaring. Inflation has since moderated, falling from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3% in June 2024. (July’s inflation figures will be released next week.) Grocery prices have largely leveled off in the last year, although they remain higher than they were before the pandemic – a potent reminder of the rising cost of living.\nEconomists have warned that Trump’s proposed import tariffs and immigration restrictions could result in higher inflation in the years to come. Researchers from the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the tariffs alone would cost the typical family about $1,700 a year. — Scott Horsley\n24. “We've agreed with NBC, fairly full agreement, subject to them, on Sept. 10th.”\nThis is ABC, not NBC.\n25. “She can't do an interview. She's barely competent and she can't do an interview.”\nHarris hasn’t done interviews since getting into the campaign, but she has done them in the past, so saying “she can’t do” one or that she is “barely competent” are just insults. Trump tends to revert to questioning the intelligence of Black women who challenge him. In fact, Trump did it nine times in this news conference, saying either Harris is not that “smart” (five times) \"incompetent” (three times) or “barely competent,” as he did here.\n26-27. “Why is it that millions of people were allowed to come into our country from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions, insane asylums, even insane asylums, that's a– it's a mental institution on steroids. That's what it is.”\nImmigration experts have said they have not been able to find any evidence of this. Adam Isacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, told FactCheck.org: “It’s hard to prove a negative — nobody’s writing a report saying, ‘Ecuador is not opening its mental institutions’ — but what I can say is that I work full-time on migration, am on many coalition mailing lists, correspond constantly with partners in the region, and scan 300+ RSS feeds and Twitter lists of press outlets and activists region wide, and I have not seen a single report indicating that this is happening. … As far as I can tell, it’s a total fabrication.”\nNotably, a version of this did happen in 1980 during the Mariel boatlift from Cuba. The Washington Post noted three years later: “Back in 1980, it seemed to be a humanitarian and patriotic gesture to accept provisionally, without papers or visas, all those fleeing from the port of Mariel. More than 125,000 came. Most were true refugees, many had families here, and the great majority has settled into American communities without mishap. But the Cuban dictator played a cruel joke. He opened his jails and mental hospitals and put their inmates on the boats too.”\nWithout a question, some migrants who have come into the U.S. have committed crimes, but the data show the vast majority do not. According to Northwestern University, immigrants are less likely to commit a crime than U.S.-born people and certainly at no higher rates that the population writ large. (Trump goes on to repeat this claim minutes later in the news conference as well, so it is included in our count here.)\n28. “We have a president that's the worst president in the history of our country.”\nTrump may have this opinion, but he says it as if it’s fact, and a 2022 survey of historians ranked Biden in the top half of presidents. Trump, on the other hand, was No. 43. The two below Trump were James Buchanan, who did little to stop the impending U.S. Civil War, and the impeached and nearly convicted Andrew Johnson.\n29. “We have a vice president who is the least admired, least respected, and the worst vice president in the history of our country.”\nA recent rating of vice presidents did not show this. Harris was in the bottom half of vice presidents, but Spiro Agnew, Dan Quayle, Henry A. Wallace and were toward the bottom of the list.\n30. “The most unpopular vice president.”\nThis might have been true about a year ago or so, but not anymore. An NBC poll then showed Harris had the lowest favorability rating of any modern VP they’d tested. But her numbers have turned around. The NPR poll had Harris with a 46%/48% favorable to unfavorable rating, which was higher than Trump’s and his running mate, JD Vance, who is among the least popular running mates in recent history.\n31. “Don't forget, she was the first one defeated. As I remember it, because I watched it very closely, but she was the first one.”\nHarris was not “defeated,” because she dropped out of the Democratic presidential race before Iowa. But even if one considers her dropping out on Dec. 3, 2019, a defeat, she was not the first of the Democratic candidates in that primary campaign to do so. At least 10 others dropped out sooner.\n32-34. “And I'm no Biden fan, but I'll tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you're looking at, they took the presidency away. … And they took it away.”\nThere’s nothing in the U.S. Constitution about picking presidential candidates. This is a party process, and everything has been done within party rules. And, again, the presidency wasn’t taken away: Biden is still president.\n35. “They said they're going to use the 25th Amendment.”\nThis was never floated as a possibility to get Biden to withdraw from the race. Biden’s Cabinet members are all people he appointed and who are loyal to him. In addition, the 25th Amendment outlines a procedure for removing a sitting president from office, not from running for a second term.\n36-39. \"They're going to hit you hard. ‘Either we can do it the nice way. I heard, I know exactly, because I know a lot of people on the other side, believe it or not. And, they said, ‘We'll do it the nice way, or we'll do it the hard way.’ And he said, ‘All right.”\nThis was not said; he did not hear; no Democrats in the know are talking to Trump; and this dialogue is made up.\n40. “We're leading, we're leading.”\nThe race is statistically tied in national polls and in the states. In some national polls, Harris leads. In some, Trump does.\n41-42. “I'm saying it's a–, for a country with a Constitution that we cherish, we cherish this Constitution to have done it this way is pretty severe, pretty horrible. … But to just take it away from him, like he was a child.”\nAgain, this is Trump talking about how Biden stepped aside, and there’s nothing in the Constitution about how the political parties should pick candidates. And nothing was taken away.\n43-46. “And he's a very angry man right now, I can tell you that. He's not happy with Obama, and he's not happy with Nancy Pelosi. Crazy Nancy, she is crazy, too. She's not happy with any of the people that told him that you've gotta leave. He's very unhappy, very angry, and I think he, He also blames her. He's trying to put up a good face, but it's a very bad thing in terms of a country when you do that. I'm not a fan of his, as you probably have noticed, and he had a rough debate, but that doesn't mean that you just take it away like that.”\nTrump can’t speak to Biden’s state of mind; all evidence is that Nancy Pelosi is perfectly sane – see her recent multiple rounds of interviews about her book, including with NPR; again, Trump doesn’t know Biden’s state of mind; and again, nobody took it away.\n47-51. “She's trying to say she had nothing to do with the border. She had everything. She was appointed to head the border. And then they said border czar. Oh, she loved that name. She loved that name. But she never went there. She went to a location once along the border, but that was a location that you would love to go and have dinner with your husband or whoever. That was a location that was not part of the problem. That was not really going to the border. So I– essentially she never went to the border.”\n(1) As previously noted, she was not put in charge of the border and certainly did not have “everything” to do with it; (2) she was not appointed to head the border; (3) if “they” is the White House, then “they” did not call her “border czar”; (4) Trump doesn’t know what Harris might have thought about the term; (5) Harris did not go to a place at the border “you would love to go and have dinner with your husband or whoever.”\nIn 2021, Harris toured border patrol facilities in El Paso, Texas, visited an area where asylum seekers were screened, and met with migrants. Republicans criticized her at the time for not going to the Rio Grande Valley.\n52. “Now we have the worst border in the history of the world.”\nWorld history is filled with cases where one country has crossed a border and invaded a neighboring country.\n53. “She destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed California as the A.G. But as the D.A. She destroyed it. She– San Francisco. … She destroyed– no cash bail, weak on crime, uh, she's terrible.”\nAs San Francisco’s district attorney from 2004 to 2011, and then California’s attorney general until 2017, it’s true that Kamala Harris was deeply connected to how crime was prosecuted during that particular period. However, no single person is responsible for destroying any city or state, not to mention that both are not destroyed.\nThere are just too many factors that contribute to why crime rises and falls. What’s more, according to the FBI, both violent and property crime rates in California more or less mirrored national trends during her tenures. As a prosecutor, Harris was largely seen as aligning more with law-and-order tendencies, though she has supported some progressive reforms, like offering certain criminal defendants drug treatment instead of going to trial. She also tweeted support for a Minnesota bail fund after the 2020 protests of George Floyd’s murder. — Meg Anderson\nDuring her campaign for the 2020 nomination, she rolled out a plan that would have phased out cash bail, and she pledged to eliminate it as president because “no one should have to sit in jail for days or even years because they don’t have the money to pay bail.” But in the same campaign, during a debate, former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard criticized Harris for keeping cash bail in place as district attorney.\n54. “And yet they weaponized the system against me.”\nThe justice system was not weaponized against Trump. Biden went through pains to not show any interference with the Justice Department. And Trump was found guilty by a jury of his peers in New York in a state case.\n55-58. “I won the big case in Florida. I won the big case. … Nobody even wrote about it. The big case.”\n(1) Trump did not “win” the classified documents case against him in Florida; (2) this was not “the big case” against him; (3) there was plenty of coverage of it; and (4) he goes on to repeat that he won the case later.\nFor context: the judge in the case controversially dismissed it, claiming the special counsel was unconstitutionally appointed despite Supreme Court decisions upholding independent counsels. The Justice Department has signaled it will appeal by the end of August but by the time the decision comes back, the election will be over.\nTrump had four criminal cases against him including the classified documents case – the fraudulent business practices case in New York, for which he was convicted on 34 felony counts; an election interference case in Georgia; and the other federal case dealing with Jan. 6. If there was a biggest case, it was the last one.\n59. “The judge was a brilliant judge, and all they do is they play the ref with the judges. But this judge was a fair but brilliant judge.”\nThere has been lots of criticism of the judge in the case, Aileen Cannon, who Trump appointed. She had very little experience as a trial judge, made several decisions that were questioned by legal experts and early in this case, had a ruling, in which she called for a special master to review classified documents first, overturned by the 11th Circuit.\n60. “Now Biden lost it because he didn't have presidential immunity. He didn't have the Presidential Records Act. He lost it.”\nThis was not “Biden’s case.” It was to be tried by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland. The Biden White House has made efforts to keep an arms-length distance from the investigation. Biden often declined to comment on the Justice Department’s and state investigations into Trump when it would likely have been politically advantageous for him to talk about it on the campaign trail.\n61. “But the– I call it prosecutors, special counsel, special prosecutor to me. He–, appointed by him and appointed by Garland. He said the man's incompetent. He can't stand trial, but he can run for president.”\nThis appears to be a misrepresentation of what special counsel Robert Hur said of Biden in a report he released investigating the president’s handling of classified documents. Hur said he wouldn’t be charging Biden, called the president “an elderly man with a poor memory\" and said a jury might find sympathy with him because of it. He did not say Biden was incompetent and could not stand trial.\n62. “She couldn't pass her bar exam.”\nThis is false. Harris passed her bar exam on the second try. She failed on first attempt, which is not unusual for California’s bar exam given its difficulty.\n63. “I was doing very well with Black voters, and I still am. I seem to be doing very well with Black males. This is according to polls, as you know.\nTrump was not doing “very well” with Black voters. Biden was not doing as well with Black voters as he did in 2020, according to most surveys, but that didn’t mean Black voters were moving heavily toward Trump. Many seemed more likely not to vote. There were signs that Trump was doing better with Black men, but there wasn’t much good evidence to support this in polling, considering most national polls have such high margins of error with voter groups. A typical national survey might have 1,000 voters and 100 or so Black voters, give or take. That’s typically a margin of error upward of +/- 10 percentage points, meaning results could be a whopping 10 points higher or lower.\n64. “Extremely well with Hispanic.”\nLike with Black voters, it’s difficult to tell in most national surveys exactly how well a candidate is doing with Latino voters because of high margins of error. “Extremely well” depends on how it’s defined, but this is an exaggeration.\n65. “Jewish voters, way up.”\nJewish voters traditionally vote roughly 2-to-1 for Democrats in presidential elections, so this seems more like a hope than reality.\n66. “White males, way up. White males have gone through the roof. White males, way up.”\nIt’s just not the case that Trump is “way up.” NPR polling finds that while Trump is doing as well as ever with white men without college degrees, Harris – and Biden before her – is actually leading with white men with college degrees, a group Trump won in 2020, according to exit polls.\n67. “It could be that I'll be affected somewhat with Black females. Well, we're doing pretty well. And I think ultimately they'll like me better, because I'm gonna give them security, safety and jobs.”\nTrump is not doing well with Black females. Black women are a key pillar Democratic voting group, and Black voters have moved more in Harris’ favor since she’s gotten in.\n69. “We have a very bad economy right now. We could, we could literally be on the throes of a depression. Not recession, a Depression. And they can't have that. They can't have that.”\nThis is not the case. See earlier fact check. (He repeats this again later in the press conference, so it is included here in the count.)\n70. “I know Josh Shapiro. He's a terrible guy. And he's not very popular with anybody.”\nA Fox News poll last month showed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a finalist to be Harris’ running mate, had a 61% approval rating in the state. Other polls also found him with a net-positive rating, though, not quite as high.\n71. “Listen, I had 107,000 people in New Jersey. You didn't report it.”\nIt was reported that the numbers come from faulty information about the size of a crowd at Trump’s rally. More accurate estimates appear to be anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000. Still, a very large crowd, but Trump is exaggerating here.\n72-77. “What did she have yesterday? 2,000 people? If I ever had 2,000 people, you'd say my campaign is finished. It's so dishonest, the press. … When she gets 1,500 people, and I saw it yesterday on ABC, which they said, ‘Oh, the crowd was so big.’ … I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size. And no, they never say the crowd was big. … I think it's so terrible when you say, ‘Well she has 1,500 people, 1,000 people,’ and they talk about, oh, the enthusiasm.”\n(1-3) Trump gave at least three incorrect estimates here, downplaying Harris’ crowd sizes (2,000, 1,500 and 1,000); (4) He also far overestimated how big his crowd sizes are compared to Harris’; (5-6) He twice said the press is dishonest about her crowd size and about his.\nFor context, the Harris campaign’s estimate was 10,000 or more at each rally. What the exact number is might be unclear — as is often the case with crowd-size estimates — but they were bigger than 2,000 and 1,500. Reporters have often commented on the size of Trump’s crowds. Frequently, they are very large, certainly larger than ones that Hillary Clinton drew in 2016 or Joe Biden this year, but Trump also regularly exaggerates their sizes.\n78. “If I were president, you wouldn't have Russia and Ukraine, where it never happened. Zero chance. You wouldn't have had Oct. 7th of Israel.”\nThis is speculation, and that there is simply no way to know what would have happened in either case if he'd been reelected.\n79. “You wouldn't have had inflation. You wouldn't have had any inflation because inflation was caused by their bad energy problems.”\nAgain, this is speculative. Energy and food prices jumped sharply around the world following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russian energy. Gasoline prices in the U.S. hit a record high topping $5 a gallon. But domestic energy production has not suffered during the Biden administration. In fact, U.S. oil and natural gas production hit record highs last year. AAA reports the average price of gasoline today is $3.45/gallon. — Scott Horsley\n80. \"I don't know if you know, they're drilling now because they had to go back because gasoline was going up to $7, $8, $9 a barrel.\"\nOil and gas production has largely been determined by energy companies. They were disciplined about not expanding production when prices were low but have become more aggressive as prices climbed. While Kamala Harris opposed “fracking” for oil and gas during her 2019 presidential campaign, she now says she would not try to outlaw the practice – which is important in battleground states such as Pennsylvania. — Scott Horsley\n81. “Everybody's going to be forced to buy an electric car, which they're not going to do because they don't want that. It's got a great market. It's got a market. It's really a sub market.”\nThe Biden administration has set a goal of having 50% of new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. It has primarily tried to achieve this through carrots rather than sticks, offering incentives to make electric cars more affordable, encouraging the development of electric charging stations and using the federal government’s own purchasing power to create demand. — Scott Horsley\n82. “We don't have enough electricity. We couldn't make enough electricity for that.”\nA shift to electric vehicles will require a rapid updating and expansion of the U.S. power grid, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. However, as EVs become more efficient, the increased demand could be reduced by as much as 50% per mile traveled over the next three decades. — Scott Horsley\n83. “The weight of a car, the weight of a truck, they want all trucks to be electric. Little things that a lot of people don't talk about. The weight of a truck is two-and-a-half times, two-and-a- half times heavier.”\nElectric vehicles are typically heavier than gasoline-powered vehicles, because of the batteries. But the weight difference is about 30%, not 250% as Trump said. What’s more, American vehicles have been getting heavier for decades, long before the move to EVs, thanks to the popularity of pickup trucks and SUVs.\n84. “You would have to rebuild every bridge in this country, if you were going to do this ridiculous policy.”\nWhile many bridges and other transportation infrastructure need improvement, the additional weight of EVs is just one of many factors that will need to be considered. Another challenge is that bridges and highways are typically funded through gasoline taxes. The shift to EVs, which don’t use gasoline, will require an alternate source of highway funding.\n85-90. “So, but on crowd size in history, for any country, nobody's had crowds like I have, and you know that. And when she gets 1,000 people and everybody starts jumping, you know that if I had a thousand people would say, people would say, that's the end of his campaign. I have hundreds of thousands of people in, uh, South Carolina. I had 88,000 people in Alabama. I had 68,000 people. Nobody says about crowd size with me, but she has 1,000 people or 1,500 people, and they say, oh, the enthusiasm's back.”\nThere were at least six different misstatements here – (1) Trump has had large crowds, but “in history,” there certainly there have been people with larger crowds, from Barack Obama and others; (2, 3) her crowds have been larger than 1,000, which he repeats twice; (4) no serious analysts have said this is the end of Trump’s campaign. This race is very close; (5) there’s no evidence for crowds of the size Trump notes in South Carolina and Alabama; (6) people do talk about Trump’s crowd sizes.\n91. “They wanna stop people from pouring into our country, from places unknown and from countries unknown from countries that nobody ever heard of.”\nSomeone has likely heard of whatever the unnamed country is.\n92-93. “We're leading in Georgia by a lot. We're leading in Pennsylvania by a lot.”\nThe races in Georgia and Pennsylvania are within the margin of error, according to an average of the polls.\n94. “So I won Alabama by a record. Nobody's ever gotten that many votes. I won South Carolina by a record. You don't win Alabama and South Carolina by records and lose Georgia. It doesn't happen.”\nIt does, and here’s why. Demographically, Georgia has become very different from South Carolina and Alabama. Georgia’s population is now majority-minority, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Alabama and South Carolina are 64% and 63% white, respectively.\nGeorgia’s Black population is also significant politically — 33% of the state’s population is Black. By comparison, Alabama is 27% Black, South Carolina 26%. Latinos also make up 11% of Georgia’s population and Asian Americans are 5%, both of which are higher than Alabama and South Carolina. And Georgia’s population is marginally younger — 15% of Georgia’s population is older than 65% compared to 18% in Alabama and 19% in South Carolina.\n95. “If we have honest elections in Georgia, if we have honest elections in Pennsylvania, We're gonna win them by a lot.”\nWinning them by a lot is highly unlikely, considering how close the states have been in recent elections, but perhaps more pressing is Trump’s insinuation that there were voting problems in the two states, which there were not. That’s why Trump is upset with Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, because he upheld the valid 2020 election results even in the face of pressure from Trump.\n96. “Of course there'll be a peaceful transfer. And there was last time.”\nThis wholly ignores the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol, which took place because of Trump’s election lies.\n97. “Because I'm leading by a lot.”\nAgain, this is a very close race.\n98. “We have commercials that are at a level I don't think that anybody's ever done before.”\nThis is false. Since Super Tuesday, Democrats have outspent Trump’s campaign and outside groups supporting him by more than double, according to data provided by AdImpact and analyzed by NPR — $373.5 million to $150.6 million.\n99. “She's not smart enough to do a news conference.”\nThere is plenty of evidence that Harris is “smart enough to do a news conference,” as she has done in the past.\n100. \"We're in great danger of being in World War III. That could happen.\"\nAgain, no serious analyst believes this.\n101. “I think those people were treated very harshly, when you compare them to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed.”\nThe Justice Department investigation into the events of Jan. 6, 2021, is the largest and most complex federal criminal probe in U.S. history, the attorney general has said. More than 140 law enforcement officers were injured that day, in what U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves has described as the biggest mass casualty event involving police. It’s hard to find any comparable event in recent American history.\nAs of Aug. 6, 2024, according to Graves’s office, prosecutors have charged more than 160 people with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Prosecutors have also secured convictions on the rarely-deployed charge of seditious conspiracy, or attempting to overthrow the government by use of force, against top leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.\nEven so, only a small number of Jan. 6 defendants have been held in federal custody while they await trial. Mostly, these are the rioters who allegedly used the most violence on that day more than three years ago. Republican members of Congress have toured the jail facilities and decried conditions there, expressions of support that defendants facing ordinary charges in D.C. have not received. — Carrie Johnson, NPR national justice correspondent\n102. “Nobody was killed on Jan. 6th.”\nConservatives were upset at the time that one of the rioters, Ashli Babbitt, was killed when she was shot by police, as she was trying to force her way into the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol, which leads to the House chamber, with a crowd of others. Many officers were injured that day; one died of a stroke as a result of Jan. 6; and others later died by suicide that their families say was also a result of Jan. 6.\n103-105. “And, you know, it's very interesting, the biggest crowd I've ever spoken to. … The biggest crowd I've ever spoken before was that day. … The biggest crowd I've ever spoken. … I've spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me.”\nIt was not the biggest crowd he’s ever spoken to. His inauguration would have topped that. And others have had bigger crowds, as noted earlier.\n106. “I said peacefully and patriotically.”\nWhile Trump did utter those words, it is misleading. Trump also said the word “fight” multiple times, and he told the already angry crowd because of the election lies he fed them: “We fight like Hell and if you don’t fight like Hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” Trump aides testified that he “refused” to tweet the word “peaceful” in the days leading up to the rally because he thought it might discourage people from being there, and he was concerned about his crowd size.\n107-108. “If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same, everything, same number of people. If not, we had more. …You look at the picture of his crowd, my crowd, uh, we actually had more people.”\nFirst, the speeches did not take place at the “same real estate.” Trump spoke from a position just south of the Ellipse. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial\nSecond, the crowds were not the same size and Trump’s was certainly not larger. It is an extraordinary claim and shows just how much Trump cares about crowd size.\n109. “We have a Constitution. It's a very important document, and we live by it. She has no votes.”\nAgain, there’s nothing in the Constitution about how parties should pick their presidents.\n110-111. “They said, ‘You're not going to win, you can't win, you're out.’ And at first they said it nicely, and he wasn't leaving, and then you, you know, the, you know it better than anybody. … At first, they were going to go out to another vote, they were going to go through a primary system, a quick primary system, which it would have to be. And then it all disappeared, and they just picked a person.”\nAs explained earlier, this is not how Biden wound up stepping aside. The story is yet another Trump invention. He also lies here in saying that “they were going to go through a primary system” and “it would have to be” a quick primary system.” There’s no requirement that a primary is held. In fact, for many years, candidates’ selection as party nominees had nothing to do with primaries, and they were not as prevalent as today.\n112-113. “That was the first out. She was the first loser, OK? So, we call her the first loser. She was the first loser when– during the primary system, during the Democrat primary system, she was the first one to quit. And she quit.”\nAs explained earlier, Harris was not the first one out in the 2020 Democratic primary race. And “first loser” appears to be a name Trump made up at this news conference, as Harris has not been referred to that way as a result of her run for the 2020 nomination.\n114. “She did, obviously, a bad job. She never made it to Iowa. Then for some reason, and I'm, I know he regrets it, you do too, uh, he picked her, and she turned on him too. She was working with the people that wanted him out.\"\nOnce again, this is a false conspiracy invented by Trump.\n115. “She was the first one out.”\nTrump repeats this false line again.\n116. “I think the abortion issue is written very much tempered down, and I've answered I think very well in the debate, and it seems to be much less of an issue, especially for those where they have the exceptions.”\nAbortion rights as a political and social issue has certainly not “tempered down.” There are millions of women, especially across the South, who do not have access to abortion and women who have experienced pregnancy losses with the inability to access medications for those necessary procedures.\n117. “As you know, and I think it's when I look for 52 years, they wanted to bring abortion back to the states. They wanted to get rid of Roe v. Wade and that's Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, and everybody. Liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back in the states. And I did that.”\nEverybody absolutely did not want that. It was actually quite unpopular for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe. And he again repeats that it has become less of an issue.\n118-119. “I think that abortion has become much less of an issue. It's a very small.”\n“I think it's actually going to be a very small issue. What I've done is I've done what every Democrat and every Every Republican wanted to have done.”\n“I think the abortion issue has been taken down many notches. I don't think it's of– I don't think it's a big factor anymore, really.”\nMinutes apart from each other, he repeats these three false claims. Abortion rights is not a “very small” issue for millions of voters. Democrats are organizing around it, and it has been seminal to Biden and Harris’ campaigns.\n120. “Previous to [Virginia Gov.] Glenn [Youngkin], the governor, he said the baby will be born, we will put the baby aside, and we will decide with the mother what we're going to do. In other words, whether or not we're going to kill the baby.”\nThis is a distortion Republicans continue to push about what former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said. This has been fact-checked by others multiple times.\n121-122. “I think the abortion issue has been, uh, taken down many notches. I don't think it's of, uh, I don't think it's a big factor anymore, really.”\n“Everybody wanted it in the states.”\n“But that issue has is very much subdued.”\nHe once again returns to the issue of abortions, which remains a “factor,” not everybody wanted it in the states, the issue is not “very much subdued.”\n123-124. “She wants to take away everyone's gun.”\nHarris has not proposed taking away all guns. She has proposed banning assault-style weapons, something that was in place for a decade. Some surveys had shown majority support for this. Others show a split. (Trump makes this case later, as well, so that is also included in the count.)\n125. “Some countries have actually gone the opposite way. They had very strong gun laws and now they have gone the opposite way, where they allowed people to have guns, where in one case they encouraged people to go out and get guns, and crime is down 29%.”\nIt’s difficult to compare gun violence and gun laws in the United States to other countries, simply because of the staggering amount of guns we have here. Although the U.S. has less than 5% of the world’s population, it holds almost 40% or more of the world’s civilian-owned guns. And it has “the highest homicide-by-firearm rate of the world’s most developed nations,” per the Council on Foreign Relations. Norway, Canada and Australia all tightened their gun restrictions after shootings. — Meg Anderson\n126. “On July 4th, 117 people were shot and 17 died. The toughest gun laws in the United States are in the city of Chicago. You know that. They had 117 people shot. Afghanistan does not have that.”\nThough Trump didn’t get the numbers exactly right, Chicago did have an incredibly violent July 4th holiday weekend this year. According to Mayor Brandon Johnson, more than 100 people were shot and 19 of those people died. Chicago does have strict gun laws, in part because its state does: Everytown For Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for gun control, ranks Illinois third in the nation for the strength of its gun-control laws. However, no state or city exists within a bubble, and Illinois is surrounded by states with much weaker laws, including Indiana, which is just a short drive from Chicago. — Meg Anderson\n127. “For 18 months, not one American soldier was shot at or killed, but not even shot at.”\nThis is, to put it charitably, misleading. It appears that he’s actually referencing the period when the Trump administration signed the deal with the Taliban, in advance of U.S. troops leaving. The deal said the U.S. would be out in 14 months, and in exchange the Taliban wouldn’t harbor terrorists and would stop attacking U.S. service members. Needless to say, the deal didn’t hold. But as the AP notes, “There was an 18-month stretch that saw no combat, or ‘hostile,’ deaths in Afghanistan: from early February 2020 to August 2021.” – Andrew Sussman\n128. “Kamala is in favor of not giving Israel weapons. That's what I hear.”\nHarris does not support an Israel weapons embargo. A Biden administration official posted on social media that Harris \"has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups.” A leader of the uncommitted movement said Harris “expressed an openness” to a meeting about an embargo, but the Biden administration official said Harris \"will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law,” not that she would support an embargo.\n129. “She's been very, very bad to Israel, and she's been very bad and disrespectful to Jewish people.”\nHarris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish. The couple has hosted Passover Seders.\n130. “Well, I know Willie Brown very well. In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought maybe this is the end. We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together and there was an emergency landing.”\nThis claim has not held up to scrutiny. Politico reported that Trump did have to make an emergency landing in a helicopter with a Black California politician decades ago, but it wasn’t Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor and state assembly speaker. It was Nate Holden, a former Los Angeles city councilman and state senator.\n131-132. “This was not a pleasant landing, and Willie was— he was a little concerned. So I know him. I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about her.”\n“He was not a fan of hers very much at that point.”\nThis is something Trump repeated twice, minutes apart from each other. Brown strongly denies having been on a helicopter with Trump or telling Trump negative things about Harris, whom he dated in the mid-1990s and supports now for president. The relationship ended in 1995.\n133. “Our tax cuts, which are the biggest in history… .”\nThe 2017 tax cuts were not the biggest in history. As a share of the economy, they barely make the top 10. They were big enough, however, to blow a big hole in the federal budget, which is why Trump was overseeing a nearly $1 trillion dollar annual deficit before the pandemic. — Scott Horsley\n134. “It'll destroy the economy.”\nThis is what Trump said will happen if his tax cuts are not renewed. But The 2017 tax cut did not deliver the economic boom that its supporters promised, and there’s no reason to think reversing a portion of the cut would cause economic destruction. — Scott Horsley\n135. “I've never seen people get elected by saying, 'We're going to give you a tax increase.'”\nVice President Harris has echoed President Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000. However, Biden has called for raising taxes on wealthy individuals and raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% – halfway back to where it was before the 2017 cut. — Scott Horsley\n136. “These guys get up, think of it. ‘We're going to give you no security.’ …”\nNo Democratic presidential candidate has advocated “no security.”\n137. “We're going to give you a weak military… .’ ”\nAn analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, showed a “review of historical defense budget trends shows there is more at play in determining overall investments in defense than just which party is in the White House.” Indeed, since the year 2000, U.S.-led wars overseas have resulted in a surge of spending by both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n138-139. “…We're going to give you no walls, no borders, no anything.”\nHarris, Walz and the Democratic Party have never said they want “no borders.” They certainly oppose Trump’s wall/fence along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, citing the exorbitant cost and its relative ineffectiveness, they say, compared to using other methods. (Trump later says that Harris wants “open borders,” so that’s included in the count here.)\n140. “...We're going to give you a tax increase.”\nAgain, this is misleading and suggests Harris wants to increase taxes across the board when they have consistently talked about increasing taxes only on the wealthy. In Harris’ view, those making more than $400,000 a year.\n141. “They're gonna destroy Social Security.”\nDemocrats have consistently advocated for keeping Social Security and making it solvent.\n142. “They've weaponized government against me. Look at the Florida case. It was a totally weaponized case. All of these cases, by the way, the New York cases are totally controlled out of the Department of Justice. They sent their top person to the various places. They went to the A.G.'s office, got that one going, then he went to the D.A.'s office, got that one going, ran through it. No, no, this is all politics, and it's a disgrace.”\nIn congressional testimony this year, Attorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers that President Biden had never called him to discuss any of the cases against Trump. Garland also had aides review Justice Department leaders’ email for any correspondence with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. In a letter to Congress in June 2024, the Justice Department said it had found no such contacts.\nIn that same letter, Justice Department legislative affairs chief Carlos Uriarte said the department did not “dispatch” former acting Associate Attorney General Matthew Colangelo to New York to join Bragg’s team prosecuting Trump. “Department leadership was unaware of his work on the investigation and prosecution involving the former president until it was reported in the news,” Uriarte wrote. — Carrie Johnson\n143. “Any time you have mail-in ballots, you're gonna have problems. ... We should have one-day voting; we should have paper ballots; we should have voter ID; and we should have proof of citizenship.”\nTrump continues to spread baseless claims about mail ballots. There’s no proof of widespread fraud with the voting method. When it comes to paper ballots, they're standard. One estimate found that in the 2024 general election, \"nearly 99% of all registered voters will live in jurisdictions where they can cast a ballot with a paper record of the vote.\"\nThe proof of citizenship comment echoes a Republican push on the issue, though studies have shown voting by non-U.S. citizens in federal elections to be exceedingly rare. The GOP-led House has passed a bill to require such documentary proof, but it’s likely to go no further in a Senate led by Democrats who are opposed to adding new voting restrictions. — Ben Swasey, voting editor\n144. “The polls have suggested, there are some polls that say we're going to win in a landslide.”\nThere are no polls that suggest Trump will win in a landslide. By all accounts, this is a very close race.\n145. “...they're paying 50, 60, 70 percent more for food than they did just a couple of years ago.”\nThe rise in grocery prices is a common complaint, but Trump exaggerates the scale of the increase. According to the Consumer Price Index, grocery prices have risen 25% since before the pandemic and 21% since President Biden took office. (At the same time, average wages have risen 23% since before the pandemic and 17% since President Biden took office.)\n146-149. The Strategic National Reserve is “virtually empty now. We've never had it this low.”\n“He's sucked all of the oil out.”\n“Essentially the gasoline to keep the, to keep the price down a little bit. … But you know what? We have no strategic national reserves now. He's emptied it. It's almost empty. It's never been this low.”\n“They've just, for the sake of getting some votes, for the sake of having gasoline–. You know, that's meant for wars. It's meant for, like, tragedy. It's not meant to keep a gasoline price down, so that somebody can vote for Biden or, in this case, Kamala.”\nThe strategic oil reserve is actually up in the past year. Biden has since repurchased about 32 million barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As of this month, the reserve held about 376 million barrels of oil. The reserve was lower when Trump left office than when he got in.\n150. “I see it right now, I see her going way down on the polls now.”\nThe opposite is true. Harris has continued her momentum since getting into the race.\n151-152. “...now that people are finding out that she destroyed San Francisco, she destroyed the state of California.”\nAs addressed earlier, Harris is not entirely responsible for San Francisco or the state of California. Crime trends there were similar to national crime trends during her time as district attorney in San Francisco and as the state’s attorney general. What’s more, preliminary data for this year indicates that many cities in California, including San Francisco, are seeing murder rates falling. (Trump repeats the claim one more time later in the news conference, so it is included in the count here.) — Meg Anderson\n153. “She was early, I mean, she was the first of the prosecutors, really, you know, now you see Philadelphia, you see Los Angeles, you see New York, you see various people that are very bad, but she was the first of the bad prosecutors, she was early.”\nAlthough Harris did refer to herself in her 2019 memoir as a “progressive prosecutor,” her legacy has largely been seen as tougher on crime. She has supported some progressive reforms, such as pretrial diversion, which offers certain criminal defendants things like drug treatment instead of going to trial. — Meg Anderson\n154. “You know, with Hillary Clinton, I could have done things to her that would have made your head spin. I thought it was a very bad thing – take the wife of a president of the United States, and put her in jail. And then I see the way they treat me. That's the way it goes. But I was very protective of her. Nobody would understand that. But I was. I think my people understand it. They used to say, lock her up, lock her up. And I'd say, just relax, please.”\nTrump called for Clinton’s imprisonment multiple times, including going along with crowd chants of “lock her up.”\n155. “Don't forget, she got a subpoena from the United States Congress, and then after getting the subpoena, she destroyed everything that she was supposed to get.\nClinton aides requested emails be deleted months before the subpoena, and the FBI said there’s no evidence the messages were deleted with a subpoena in mind. — Carrie Johnson\n156. “I thought it was so bad to take her, and put her in jail, the wife of a president of the United States. And then, when it's my turn, nobody thinks that way.”\nThe Justice Department closed an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server to conduct some State Department business in 2016. Then-FBI Director Jim Comey gave a press conference to explain his reasoning in July of that election year. Comey said, “We did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information,” but he criticized Clinton and her aides for being “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information” that flowed through the server.\nBy contrast, prosecutors in the Florida case against former President Donald Trump said Trump had flouted requests from the FBI and a subpoena for highly classified materials he stored in unsecure spaces like a ballroom and a bathroom at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The indictment in that case accuses Trump of unlawfully retaining government secrets and of intentionally obstructing justice with the help of an aide who moved boxes of materials and otherwise allegedly thwarted the FBI probe. Trump and his co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The Justice Department says it is appealing the district court’s decision to toss the case on constitutional grounds. — Carrie Johnson\n157. “A lot of the MAGA, as they call them, but the base. And I think the base is, I think the base is 75% of the country, far beyond the Republican Party.”\nRounding up, Trump won 46% of the vote in 2016 and 47% of the vote in 2020. He has a high floor, but a low ceiling politically. Majorities continue to say they have an unfavorable rating of Trump, which has been consistent for years. No American presidential candidate has ever gotten 75% of the vote in this country, dating back to 1824 since data was kept for popular votes. Lyndon B. Johnson got 61% in 1964, Richard Nixon slightly less than 61% in 1972, Ronald Reagan 59% in 1984. Since then, Barack Obama got nearly 53% in 2008 and 51% in 2012, the first candidate since Eisenhower to win at least 51% of the vote twice.\n158. “My sons are members, and I guess indirectly I'm a member, too.”\nTrump here is talking about membership in the National Rifle Association. Another family member being an NRA member does not make someone else an NRA member “indirectly.”\n159. “She served 24 years for being on a phone call having to do with drugs. You know who I'm talking about. She was great. And she had another 24 years to go. And it was largely about marijuana, which in many cases is now legalized, OK?”\nPresumably, Trump is talking about Alice Marie Johnson, who had been convicted on cocaine conspiracy and money laundering charges. Kim Kardashian advocated for Johnson and won a pardon for her from Trump.\n160. “They're either really stupid, and I don't believe they're stupid, because anybody that can cheat in elections like they cheat is not stupid.”\nMore than 60 court cases proved there was not widespread fraud or cheating that would have made any difference in any state.\n161. “Lately I've seen where they're trying to sign these people up to vote. And they have to stop. They cannot let illegal immigrants vote in this upcoming election.”\nThis is a conspiracy not based in fact. Immigrants in the country illegally cannot vote in presidential elections, and there’s no evidence there is an intentional effort to sign them up in mass numbers to sway elections.\n162. “If you go to California, and you ask the people of California, do they like the idea of sanctuary cities? They don't like it.”\nThe subject of sanctuary cities actually mostly splits Californians. Slim majorities have actually said that they favor the sanctuary-state law and are against their cities opting out of the law. Of course, this breaks down along party lines, and since California is heavily Democratic, those results might not be surprising. But it’s more divided than Trump suggests.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        [an error occurred while processing this directive]\n[an error occurred while processing this directive]\nI'm delighted to be here for at least three reasons. First reason, it is the Landon Lecture Series. Now, I'm a political reporter and I have been for 40 years. I did not ever meet Alf Landon, but of course I know a great deal about him. But I have met his daughter, Nancy Kassebaum, and I think she's terrific as a person and as a public servant. I admire Senator Kassebaum tremendously.\nBob Strauss, the Democratic power broker in Washington a few months ago threw a dinner upon the occasion of the nuptials with Howard Baker, another member of the Senate in years past, and someone else I admire, and he was kind enough to send me an invitation, and it said Wednesday night. Well, I work on Wednesday night, but I fired off a letter and l said, \"Bob, I'm going to have the lovely Diane Sawyer anchor alone tonight -- or next Wednesday. I'm going to be there, nothing will keep me and Jan away.\"\nWe went, it was a lovely evening. The next morning I got up and discovered that we had one of the highest ratings in the history of Prime Time Live. I'll never miss a Wednesday night for Nancy or anyone else again.\nSecond reason I'm delighted to be here is because of Jon Wefald. We met 25 years ago. Now, he was just a pup in those days. I was covering Hubert Humphrey the great, and I mean that, and John, as you probably know, was the Secretary of Agriculture for the great state of Minnesota and he was, of course, a Humphrey fan and someone helping out in the campaign.\nI can see Hubert as if he were still standing here today, popping his cuff-links saying how pleased -- \"I'm pleased as punch to be here.\" And we were trading war stories earlier about this, and I'm not going to take up your time or John's with them, but if you want to hear them, just ask President Wefald. And I'll just give you a clue, say, \"Mr. President, tell us about the day you had to borrow a pair of Hubert Humphrey's pants.\" Hope I got you in a lot of trouble there, Jon.\nThe third reason I'm delighted to be here is I get to talk about anything I want to talk about, the story of my life. No, no, no, not that. And, you know, I could talk about Bill Clinton, I could talk about Paula Jones -- that's the same thing. I could talk about -- you know, I could talk about Marv Albert.\nBut instead, as my little silly remarks suggest, I'm going to talk about the state of television news today. Now everybody else is doing it. I mean, Dan is doing it, and Ted Koppel, my great buddy, is doing it, and everybody is doing it, and most of them are denouncing us.\nWell, I think that's a little shortsighted, I mean, for me to get up and tell you what a bunch of bums we are doesn't suggest to me the way to get you to watch television news. So I'm going to do something a little different, and I know something about it, I've been in it for 40 years.\nAlthough I am just marginally smart enough to know that I may not always be right. I'm reminded of a couple of quick stories, the ancient king who said to one of his aides, \"I want you to bring me something which is true now, always. Tell me what is always going to be true or it's your head.\" And the poor guy thought he finally saved his head by saying, \"This phrase, Your Majesty. And this too shall pass.\"\nBut the one I really like is Conrad Hilton, who after 50 years, the late hotel magnate, being in the hotel business, once said, \"You know, the only thing I think I really know that's true about this business is that it's better to put the shower curtain on the inside of the tub than the outside of the tub.\"\nSo with that as a buildup, here I go. Now, when I talk to journalism students I often sit down with them and I say, \"All right, now do you want to talk about the news and the news business the way we want it to be, the way we'd like it to be, the way in theory it ought to be, or do you want to talk about the real world?\"\nOh, they're all smart, a lot smarter than I was when I went to college I crammed for an exam the night before, I drank a lot of beer, I know you don't do that today. You're much smarter. But they're all smart and they say, \"We want to talk about the real world .\" So I usually start out, as I will today, by saying in the real world television news is a business.\nWe are in business. We are in business to make money. Now, that comes as a shock to them, because I'm supposed to say in the best traditions of the great people of our business, Edward R. Murrow and others, that we are only there to bring people information that they need to use in their daily lives and in the lives of the republic and to do it as accurately as we can and without any personal motive or agenda. Now, that is, of course, what we think we're trying to do, but we're doing it within a business.\nI like the profit motive. Excuse me, I don't want the government to subsidize radio and television.\nTo an extent it does two organizations, PBS, you watch it, it's a very good network. and National Public Radio, where my other lovely sidekick, the Cokester, Cokie Roberts, holds forth many mornings. And that's terrific. Ah, the Cokester. I am very lucky to work with her. I like her, I think she's smart, I think she's witty and all of that and I call her the Cokester.\nAnd the other day we were on the Conan O'Brien show, and you'll immediately say \"What is a serious journalist doing on the Conan O'Brien -\" we're trying to build the house, ladies and gentlemen, I'll come to that in a moment. And they said, \"Why do you call her the Cokester?\" And I said. \"Well, you know, it has nothing to do with shooting a line.\"\nAnd I was shocked at my own knowledge of that subject. I've never shot a line in my life, may I say, and I'm not even running for public office, didn't inhale or any of that good stuff. I think she's terrific.\nWe do this on Sunday morning. George Will, of course, is the other regular there. I used to say of George Will, who I know has addressed this distinguished assemblage, that he was the smartest man I know in this business, until one day someone said they got up to the audience, \"We'll take questions in a few moments,\" and said, \"Well, if he's so smart, how come you always disagree with him?\" So I just say he's tough and a good guy, and we do all of that on a Sunday morning.\nBut in the real world, those of us who do that or the evening news, or news specials, or special events when some horrible catastrophe has occurred, or when there's a Gulf War, we are in business. It wasn't always that way.\nIn the early days of television -- and, in fact, I'm so long in the -- when I got into this business, there were, of course, only three networks, ABC, CBS or NBC, and the founders were still alive, the Sarnoffs, Bill Paley for CBS, Leonard Goldenson, who is still alive today, retired ABC. And they were rolling in money. We had 98 percent of the television audience in this country, a few local stations had the other 2 percent, and you all had to watch us, and they made money. It was a machine. You just printed it in the entertainment portion of the network. So the news departments didn't have to make money and they didn't. They were loss leaders.\nMr. Paley would go down to Washington and would be complimented by the members of the United States Senate and the President himself on \"Fine public service, Mr. Paley. We saw that news broadcast, Harvest of Shame you did,\" and he would glow. And the news department was a lot -- did not have big audiences.\nI mentioned Harvest of Shame. It's a great documentary in the early '60s that Edward R. Murrow did for the first time in a national sense, exposing the plight of migrant workers. Very few people watched, but we gave it every award in the book. It deserved it, and it didn't matter that very few people watched. Influential people watched and laws were changed.\nMy personal hero, Howard K. Smith, a name you probably don't know, because he's been retired since 1978, did an hour-long documentary. \"Who Speaks for Birmingham.\" For the first time this country saw Bull Conner the police commissioner, with dogs and the water hoses against other Americans, their skin was black, of course. And it was a shock and it helped propel the momentum that changed the jury laws of the south. Very few people watched, didn't matter, didn't have to make money.\nThe news departments were free to say to all of you and to the vast audience, 98 percent of which we had, \"We'd like you to watch our programming. We think it's important in the news sense, and you're certainly welcome, but if you don't want to, it's okay with us, hey, fine, go, go, read the Inquirer, do whatever you want to do, I don't care.\"\nThat persisted through this great halcyon decade of the '60s, halcyon in the sense of the news business. You know, I got to thinking the news business was, you know, this terrible civil rights struggle, terrible assassinations, Vietnam, putting a man on the moon, I thought every day there would be a new headline of that type.\nWe went into the '70s and it was still the same way. In 1973 there were hearings on Capitol Hill in the Senate, the so-called Watergate Committee that began the investigation of Richard M. Nixon, which eventually, as you know, led to Mr. Nixon leaving town one step ahead of the sheriff. And people were interested in those hearings that Sam Ervin, the senator from North Carolina held that summer.\nAnd lots of people watched, because the networks covered it gavel to gavel, but after the first week realized they were losing money, so every third day a different network would cover it. So every third day if you wanted to watch the Watergate hearings, you had to watch me. You didn't have a choice. Was no choice. You had to watch me, whether you liked me or not if you wanted to watch it on television. Because in those days, what, there was no C-Span, there was CNN, there was no cable, and if you said, \"Well, I'm at home and I think I'll watch a movie,\" no, you won't. There was no VCR. Turn on the television set, me or the guy on NBC or the guy on CBS, that was it.\nAnd then something happened. His name was Ted Turner, and he put his Super Station on satellite and then a bunch of people, some guy named John Malone -- sounds like a breakfast food, right started these cable companies. And instead of 98 percent of the audience, the television networks had 89 percent. Still massive.\nAnd then a couple years later, 82 percent, still very good. Then we had 75 percent and about that time the bosses, all of them still alive, except the senior Sarnoff, came to the news departments and said, \"Boys --\" because we were still making the horrible transition to discover that women should be let into the business. You know, because at first we didn't do that. We finally got a little sense. \"Boys, guess what, you have to make the money now. Sorry, got to make the money, bottom line, everybody's gotta do it, give at the office. We're not making all this money that we used to anymore. Look at these various channels that have sprung up. So let's see the cash.\"\nWell, it was quite a start to us. How are we going to make the money? Well, you make the money by, you know, increasing the size of the audience, because we were selling commercials all along, it just wasn't paying all the expenses. Well, we have to get a bigger audience.\nWell, we already had the news audience, people like everyone here in this auditorium, you watch the news. Maybe not every day, but you care about what goes on the world. Now, your presence here for me may not demonstrate that, but for most lecturers it would. So we had you, but you were not enough, because there are three great audiences for watching the tube, and in the twinkling of an eye it's going to be that computer screen, and who knows after that.\nThere's you, the news audience. You're very important to this country, you're very influential, you really drive the country at a local level and a national level, but you are smaller compared to the second audience.\nThese are people who are very good people, they're smart people, my mythical bus driver, maybe here in Manhattan or some place. The guy goes to work every day, he does a good job, very essential to the community, he makes a living for his family, he goes to PTA on Thursday night, maybe he plays a little golf on the public course on Saturday if he can. He comes home though after work and he sits down on the sofa and he wants to be entertained. Does he want to sit there and watch the hole in the ozone layer? No. He has his beer and he doesn't normally watch news programs. But that's a big audience.\nSo if I look around, say I got to make some money, I have to increase the audience, I'm suddenly saying, \"Hey, I can't take the attitude if you want to watch, fine, if you don't want to watch, it's all right with me. I got to see what this bus driver would like to watch, or at least I've got to see how I can interest him in what I think he ought to watch.\"\nAnd then there's a third audience. Fortunately, I don't think it's that big, but it's sizeable, and these are people who believe that there are three-headed cows, and that Elvis was seen in a Sheboygan supermarket last Wednesday. They really do.\nAnd they're there. We never paid any attention to them, and we knew they would never watch us and we didn't care. And we kind of looked down our nose at them anyway, being the elite, you know, particularly those of us who -- well, I'm from New Mexico and -- but anyway, I'm now part of the inside the Beltway elites back in Washington, but all of a sudden we even began to sort of say, \"Hi, how are you?\" to the three-headed cows, because we have to increase the audience.\nStill it wasn't awful, it wasn't awful, there was just a few channels, and still people wanted to hear the news, because there was a man named Brezhnev, and he had nuclear missiles pointed at Kansas, the Soviet leader, and lots of news was happening. Into the '80s news was happening.\nBut finally by the time the '90s got here the jig was up. On a good night in the summer now the three commercial television networks have less than 50 percent of the audience. Still the biggest audience, but less than 50 percent.\nLet me show you something. You can't see it. Take my word for it, right? I'm an honest guy. These are the listings of the channels available today in New York City. There are 87 of them, not 3 networks, 87. 17 of them are really news channels in one direct form or another.\nAnd so you're still out there but now you don't have to watch me, you can watch Jim Lehrer, a terrific guy, with the News Hour on PBS. You can watch the History Channel with Roger Mudd and some great stuff. You can watch A & E, as you are, six of you are here going to watch the History Channel, and 40 of you are going to watch the News Hour with Jim Lehrer, and 6 are going to watch A & E, and a few will still watch me, too few now.\nToo few for any of us to do business. Too few for these inflated salaries that some -- can you imagine the salary some of those people make in television? \"I'm not gonna give it back, let me tell you, I've got mortgages up to here.\" Too few. Too few for the stockholders.\nSo now I've got to go to the second audience. I appreciate my colleagues who at this point stop and say, \"No, do the responsible job that Edward R. Murrow did. Do the job that does not pulverize our business, do the job that brings Americans important stories. Yes, there's no Brezhnev, yes, there's no Soviet Union, yes, Mr. Mandella is not being let out of jail again today. Yes, California has not sunk into the ocean with the San Andreas Fault hot behind today, but you do the news.\nLet's reform the social security system, and I want that on every night. And let's put the hole in the Ozone layer, because it will kill us all, you understand, if we don't get hold of this.\" And I agree that that's important, but, my friends, you can talk that way if you want, and I'm for you, in my heart I think you're exactly right, but we're going out of business, and I don't think that's necessary.\nSo what's my solution, that we just go right down the stream, we get right down there with the National Inquirer, I mean we're going to grovel in there with all those wonderful people I mentioned, save one, who is the President of the United States, an honorable man.\nNo. What we've got to try to do is figure out a way to interest that second audience again. Let the three-headed cow people go. If they want to come, fine, I believe in democracy and the 1st Amendment, but I don't think we can go that far. But we've got to get that bus driver watching us on a regular basis\nAnd the way I think we do it is -- you can't do it by saying, '\"You, you there in the red dress, this is important to you, very important, so therefore you must watch.\" Or \"You, sir, in order to exercise your franchise as a citizen in this country and vote intelligently, you need to know these things.\"\nAre you kidding? In a pig's eye. You're going to watch ESPN, that's where I would be. Martha Stewart's got a new program on, that's where I would be. Because again, no Soviet missiles are there, I mean, you understand, it's not life and death, and for me to tell you that this is important is not the way to get anyone to watch.\nNow, I have to come to you and somehow say \"Hole in the ozone layer, fascinating, interesting, dynamic, dramatic, maybe even slightly titillating. I mean, you know. Here, we did this.\nI use that example. I'm proud of Prime Time Live. Three or four years ago one of our great correspondents, John Quinones, went down to a city in Chile, in southern Chile, that is right beneath one of these contracting expanding holes in the ozone layer, and he didn't start by saying \"Tonight are three distinguished scientists who will explain to us the degradation of ozone and its consequences,\" he started with a mother crying, holding her infant who had an unexplained disease. There was a drama there. I want the bus driver to say, \"Maude, come on here, look at this, look at this poor woman.\"\nNow, while he's looking we'll just slip him a little information about what causes the hole in the ozone.\nThen we're going to show him the sheep with the unexplained blindness, and then we do some other fancy footwork.\nThere is no requirement, in my view, to be boring in order to be responsible. You can be irresponsible and be boring or you can be irresponsible and be non-boring, but you cannot automatically equate the two. I think what we have to do in television news, because it will never go back to 98 percent or 88 percent or 76 percent, you all will stay run off, because in the twinkling of an eye in New York, instead of 87 channels it will be 187, it's just going to get worse, and from the standpoint of news I can't predict.\nMaybe tomorrow there will be horrible catastrophe or something terrible important to your lives, you'll say, \"I'm going have to watch this again. It didn't matter, but now I have to.\" But we can't count on that.\nI would love to have good times. Hey, let's not have a recession, let's not have a war, it's okay with me. Oh, sure, my ratings will benefit if it does, but I'm just, again, marginally smart enough to know that that's not way to conduct one's self in life.\nSo what we have to do is say, \"These are things that will interest you. These are things that you're going to want to watch, because we're going to present the story, the news story, if you will, in such an interesting fashion that you're going to feel -- \" I'm going to use a terrible word in our business \"that you're being entertained.\"\nWhat's wrong with being entertained, as long as I am accurate, as long as I am not incomplete, as long as I am objective, in other words, and as long as I'm talking about something that does matter, as opposed to something that doesn't matter, why shouldn't I entertain you? I'm not much of a stand-up comic, but hey, I can learn.\nI was interviewing Warren Buffet the other day, not for television, but in Phoenix before the managers of the Disney company, and I asked him a simple question. I said, \"How does it feel to be rich?\" \"Well,\" he said -- you know, he's an old soft shoe that's worth $37 billion, but he said, \"I actually live on $100,000 a year.\"\nAnd I'm thinking to myself, \"Hey, to most Americans that qualifies.\" He said, I live in the same house, frame house, I lived in Omaha, you know, all my life and take public transportation frequently, and all of that.\" And he said, \"You know, I make money because I buy into businesses that I think are well run and that are in the growth field.\" \"And,\" he said, \"I have a lot of managers who are in their high seventies, I have one guy who's 82, because, he says, \"You cannot teach a new dog old tricks.\" Hey, here's an old dog that you can teach some new tricks.\nSo when it comes to television news, I guess what I'm saying to you in a very long-winded way, is that there are conditions beyond which we have not had a lot of control, which have reduced us in our size, in our scope, in our ability to bring information to people, and us, meaning a single news organization. And in the absence of major, horrible or important stories, we're not going to come on the air and say \"Good evening, there's no news today, I'm taking the rest of the day off.\" So we're going to say good evening, and we're going to try to bring something to you. But our challenge is to bring it to you in such an interesting way, that while we might not wean you from ER or Seinfeld, we'll certainly do Home Improvement in, I mean, we'll present the news so that you'll want to watch it. And that's our only salvation, I think, as news organizations at the network level.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

For the most up-to-date guide on marijuana law, please visit Marijuana Justice's Know Your Rights page.\nToday is 4/20, an unofficial marijuana holiday that many people celebrate by lighting one up. Any day now, the governor will sign an historic bill making marijuana legal in Virginia. It marks the beginning of the end of the failed War on Drugs that disproportionately polices and incarcerates Black and Brown people.\nBefore you bust out the weed thinking that marijuana is fully legal, you should know your rights. We’ve got a rundown of what you can – and can’t – do under Virginia’s new laws.\nWhat exactly is legal?\nStarting July 1 of this year, it will be legal for adults 21 and older to carry less than one ounce of marijuana in public.\nYou cannot legally be penalized for carrying marijuana as you go about your daily business, as long as it’s under an ounce. How much is that? Check out Leafly's visual guide to weed quantities.\nThere will be consequences if you get caught holding more than one ounce in public. If you get caught with more than one ounce but less than one pound, you’ll have to pay up to a $25 civil penalty. Do not ever carry more than one pound. If you get caught, you could get one to 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine.\nIt is also illegal for anyone at any age to bring marijuana onto school grounds. The punishment is a Class 2 misdemeanor, which could result in up to six months of jailtime and up to a $1,000 fine, not to mention the burdensome consequences of a criminal record.\nOkay, so you’re saying it’s legal for adults over 21 to smoke marijuana in public?\nNo. The law distinguishes between possession and use, even though they’re just one step away from each other. It is illegal to smoke or consume weed in public. It is also illegal to offer marijuana to someone else, whether they accept it or not. Giving marijuana to a minor in any situation has criminal consequences. The only thing that is legal is having less than one ounce with you, but it has to stay in your pocket or bag.\nIf caught using or giving marijuana to another person in public, you will face a range of penalties. For your first offense, you will pay up to a $25 fine. For your second offense, you’ll be required to pay another fine and enter a substance abuse treatment and education program. For your third offense, you will be charged a Class 4 misdemeanor, which will result in a $250 fine.\nWhen can I legally buy recreational marijuana?\nLegal sales of recreational marijuana will not begin until January 1, 2024. Starting then, only adults over the age of 21 will be able to legally purchase and use recreational marijuana.\nWhat’s taking so long? The state still has to establish the new industry’s rules and regulations and set up the Cannabis Control Authority, which will enforce those rules and regulations. Lawmakers delayed deciding on important questions about how to administer business licenses and whether local governments will have the power to prohibit retail marijuana stores from setting up shop in their jurisdiction. These decisions will be made over the next couple years before the legal market begins on January 1, 2024.\nI’m under 21. Is it legal for me to use marijuana?\nNo. If you’re under the age of 21, it’s illegal to have or use any amount of marijuana. If you get caught with it, you will be required to pay up to a $25 fine and enter a substance abuse treatment and education program.\nIf you’re under 18 and caught with marijuana, the consequences could be even worse. At the very least, you’ll be fined and required to enter a substance abuse program. Juvenile court will also treat you as “delinquent,” which, depending on the circumstances, could subject you to a range of additional punishments.\nUnder Virginia law, courts can legally put you on probation, suspend your driver’s license, fine you up to $500, make your parents participate in a substance abuse program, and even take custody away from your parent or guardian. Judges have a huge amount of discretion and can turn your simple marijuana case into something much worse.\nWhat does the law say about marijuana in cars and vehicles?\nIt’s complicated. Basically, there are still several offenses in the new law that allow police to stop and arrest you. Bottom line: Never use marijuana in a car or vehicle. It’s illegal whether you’re the driver or a passenger.\nDo your best to not even bring marijuana with you on the road. If you must, keep it in the trunk. Having an “open container” of marijuana like a plastic bag, jar, or Tupperware anywhere in the vehicle will give law enforcement reason to presume you consumed it while driving, which is punishable by a misdemeanor and up to $250 fine.\nIf you drive a commercial motor vehicle like a truck, bus, trailer or taxi, keeping marijuana anywhere inside is punishable by a $25 fine.\nIf you’re a school bus driver or driver for a ride-sharing company like Uber or Lyft, it is illegal to have or use marijuana under any circumstance. Violating this law will potentially get you jailtime and hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in fines.\nCan I grow marijuana in my home?\nYes, with certain limits. Starting July 1 of this year, each household can legally cultivate up to four plants. Notice the limit is per household, not person. So if you live with roommates, the total number of plants you can grow collectively is still four. Exceeding this limit comes with escalating penalties, from a $250 fine for growing five to ten plants, to misdemeanor and felony charges for above that.\nIf you home grow, you must make sure your plants are not visible to the public or accessible to minors. The law does not specify what preventative measures you should take or how penalties will be enforced.\nHome growers must also tag each of their plants with their name, driver’s license or state ID number, and notation that it is for personal use.\nKeep in mind that there is currently no legal way to purchase seeds or cuttings for home growth before January 1, 2024.\nI have a marijuana-related offense on my criminal record. Can I get it sealed?\nThe new legislation allows certain records to be sealed. However, due to technological barriers, record sealing likely won’t begin until July 1, 2025. The law allows records to be sealed as soon as the involved state agencies are ready, but it is hard to predict how quickly they can set up the system.\nNo later than October 1, 2025, courts will begin automatically sealing the records of people who were previously arrested, charged, or convicted for simple possession of marijuana or for selling, giving, or distributing less than one ounce of marijuana.\nAdditionally, people with more serious marijuana charges on their records (such as selling more than one ounce of marijuana or any marijuana-related drug paraphernalia) will be able to petition a judge to have their records sealed starting July 1, 2025.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg.

Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR.\nToday’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy.\nWe are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards.\nSo, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it.\nI thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production?\nKISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you.\nSo, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world.\nAnd it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize.\nSo, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds.\nFASKIANOS: Fantastic.\nI thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic.\nKISSANE: Sure.\nSo, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil.\nYou know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day.\nSo, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand.\nAnd you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation.\nSo, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers.\nAnd again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision.\nNow, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+.\nAnd these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves.\nAnd then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand.\nBut again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies.\nAnd so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas.\nAnd then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand.\nAnd I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil.\nAnd again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day.\nAnd then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies.\nBut again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil.\nAnd again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less.\nSo, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great.\nSo now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments.\n(Gives queuing instructions.)\nAll right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself.\n(Pause.)\nYou are still muted.\n(Pause.)\nOK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK.\nLet’s go to Morton Holbrook.\nQ: Yes, good afternoon.\nDr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market?\nThank you.\nKISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question.\nYeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency.\nSo, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil.\nI think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system.\nOne of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten.\nSo, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand.\nNow, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil.\nAnd I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil.\nSo, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles.\nBut there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia?\nKISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one.\nSo, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done.\nAnd again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil.\nSo, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted.\nSo, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting.\nBut I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship.\nThat’s a great question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.\nQ: Hello?\nFASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open.\nQ: Can you hear me now?\nFASKIANOS: Yes.\nQ: That’s better. OK.\nFASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much.\nQ: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is.\nQ: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn.\nMy question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund?\nAnd thank you to Mrs. Irina.\nKISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar.\nSo, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question.\nQ: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund?\nKISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question.\nYou know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well.\nYou know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world.\nSo, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil.\nBut I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean.\nBut again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil.\nAnd you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR.\nBut thank you for the question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil?\nKISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question.\nSo, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located?\nSo you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity.\nYou know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States.\nSo, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy?\nKISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much.\nYeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron.\nBut I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential.\nSo, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue.\nAnd another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself.\nQ: Can you hear me, please?\nFASKIANOS: Yes, we can.\nQ: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University.\nAnd my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent?\nKISSANE: Thank you.\nQ: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that.\nKISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question.\nYeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure.\nI think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based.\nAnd that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal.\nAnd I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important.\nAnd again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa.\nSo again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach.\nSo, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that.\nKISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question.\nYeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent.\nSo, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies.\nAnd so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition.\nSo, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition.\nSo, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change.\nSo you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami.\nQ: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program.\nJust to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries?\nFASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct?\nQ: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nKISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second?\nCan I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but—\nQ: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)?\nKISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries.\nYou know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there.\nSomeone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it.\nI think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward.\nFASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this?\nKISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made.\nYou know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil.\nAnd one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia.\nAnd we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to.\nAnd again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions.\nAnd you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it.\nA really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel.\nSo, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy?\nKISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference.\nYeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open.\nSo, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system.\nSweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero.\nWe also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy.\nSo, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear.\nSo, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system.\nFASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all.\nSo, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina.\nSo, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy?\nKISSANE: Great question.\nI think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play.\nI think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe.\nThat said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition.\nFASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for?\nKISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like.\nI think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical.\nSo, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex.\nSo, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.\nFASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments.

Rank\nGun Law Strength\nComposite score\nGun Violence Rate\nGun deaths per 100,000 residents\nIf every state in the country had the gun death rates of our National Leaders, we could save 299,000 lives in the next decade.1Everytown Research analysis of CDC WONDER state gun death rates and Everytown Gun Law Rankings 2025. Each state’s baseline projection reflects the average annual crude gun death rate change it experienced from 2012 to 2023 (i.e., the decade prior, excluding 2020 and 2021 to avoid skewing projections with COVID-driven trends that are already reversing). This percent change was then applied to provisional 2023 data to project gun deaths over the next decade. To determine the lives that could be saved, researchers then subtracted from these projections the number of deaths that would have occurred had each state experienced the same (lower) average annual gun death rate and rate change as the National Leaders.\nGun laws work\nWhen we compare the states head-to-head on the top 50 gun safety policies, a clear pattern emerges. States with strong laws see less gun violence. Indeed, the states that have failed to put basic protections into place—”national failures” on our scale—have a rate of gun deaths two and a half times higher than the states that are national gun safety leaders.\nStrong Gun Laws, Fewer Deaths\n-\nNational Leaders\n-\nMaking Progress\n-\nMissing Key Laws\n-\nWeak Systems\n-\nNational Failures\nThe top 50 laws we focus on represent a wide range of interventions. Some block gun access by people who pose a threat with a firearm while others focus on limiting gun violence in public. Some seek to increase police accountability and protect civil rights, while another set targets bad actors in the gun industry.\nAll states should start with a core group of five foundational laws—passing background checks and/or purchase permitting, along with Extreme Risk laws and secure gun storage requirements; and rejecting Shoot First (also known as Stand Your Ground) and permitless carry laws. While each of the top 16 states in the gun law rankings has all five of these policies in place, only one of the bottom 18 states has even one of these critical protections.\nThe national gun safety landscape has seen states move in opposite directions in recent years. While all 11 states in our “making progress” tier have made significant additions to their firearm laws in recent years—with more than half adding several points to its gun law score—a whopping 28 states at the other end of the scale have made the dangerous decision to repeal their concealed carry permit requirements.\nOur gun law rankings are a roadmap for how to build the ideal state system. They will walk you through the most important policies and help you compare these protections across the country.\nEven the strongest system can’t protect a state from its neighbors’ weak laws\nThe rankings clearly show that gun laws save lives. But no state is an island (except Hawaii), and any state may be vulnerable if its neighbors fail to protect public safety. That’s how northeastern states with strong laws ended up victims of the infamous “iron pipeline,” the route traffickers use to bring guns up from southeastern states with weak laws. The evidence tells a simple story about porous borders: Out of all guns showing up at crime scenes after crossing state lines, nearly three out of four come from states that lack good background check laws.\nNotable strong law states like Illinois and Maryland remain plagued with high gun violence in their biggest cities—in large part because they’re targeted by traffickers. Indeed an outsized share of likely trafficked crime guns recovered in Illinois begin their journey in states with weak laws. And Virginia, which had weak gun purchase laws until 2020, has long been the top supplier of crime guns into Maryland. At the other end of the scale, states like New Hampshire and Rhode Island have unusually low gun death rates compared with their somewhat weaker policies, in part because they are buffered by robust laws among other states in the region.\nHigh gun ownership rates also play a role in strong states where deaths are higher\nAccess to a firearm drastically increases the likelihood of suicide and a gun in the home is associated with more gun homicide. Again, a state like Rhode Island has low gun violence relative to the strength of its laws—likely due in part to its very low gun ownership rate (it’s among the lowest in the nation). On the other hand, states like Nevada and New Mexico have higher rates of gun violence than their laws might suggest—perhaps in part as a result of above-average gun ownership.\nIt takes time for new laws to have an impact\nSeveral states have had recent success passing strong policy—for example, Nevada added half of its gun law score and New Mexico added close to 50% of its score in the past several years. Both states enacted Extreme Risk, background check, secure storage, and domestic violence laws, with New Mexico also limiting qualified immunity, addressing the Charleston Loophole, and adding a waiting period, and Nevada tackling ghost guns and prohibiting bump stocks. Those states can hope to see newfound protection in the coming years—and more lives saved.\nAt the other end of the scale, Iowa repealed both its background check and carry permit laws in 2021, losing over 40% of its gun law score in one year, and in 2024 passed a dangerous law allowing teachers to carry guns into K-12 schools. This new, radical change in its score provides a partial and likely temporary explanation for its relatively low gun death rate. Iowans should be concerned about a future spike in violence.\nFederal laws help prevent gun violence nationwide\nAll 50 states can rely on a backbone of federal laws to help keep guns out of the wrong hands. Yet the federal system is far too weak overall—for example, failing to require background checks on all gun sales and giving special legal immunity to the gun industry. State policymakers should protect their residents by filling the many gaps in federal law, and must also take action where state power is at its strongest, such as requiring a process for domestic abusers to turn in guns when they become prohibited from having them.\nThere’s work to do beyond strong state laws\nBy comparing state gun laws with gun violence outcomes, we see how critical it is to enact strong policy. But a caveat is required: There is necessary non-legislative gun safety work this site doesn’t show—including community-based violence intervention programs; regulatory efforts, funding campaigns, and on-the-ground implementation; local executive action and city and town ordinances; and responsible cultural norms around gun safety.\nWhere do we go from here?\nA safer future is possible.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: I have a brief statement, and then I’ll be happy to take your questions.\nFirst, I just finished, I thought, a productive meeting with the congressional leadership about the path forward to make sure America does not default — I emphasize does not default on its debt for the first time in history.\nAnd I’m pleased but not surprised to hear Republican Minority Leader of the United States Senate saying that — at our meeting that the United States is not going to default. It never has, and it never will. And he’s absolutely correct.\nWe continue — we agree to continue our discussions, and we’re going to meet again on Friday.\nIn the meantime, our staffs — we’re going to meet today and daily between now and then. And everyone in the meeting understood the risk of default. Our economy would fall into a significant recession. It would devastate retirement accounts, increase borrowing cost. According to Moody’s, nearly 8 million Americans would lose their jobs. And our international reputation would be damaged in the extreme. The last part is me — international. He didn’t — Moody’s did not say the last part about damage in the extreme.\nI made clear during our meeting that default is not an option. I repeated that time and again. America is not a deadbeat nation. We pay our bills. And avoiding default is a basic duty of the United States Congress. In fact, they did it three times under my predecessor without once — not one time — creating a crisis, rattling the markets, or undermining the unshakable trust the world has in America’s commitment to paying its bills.\nAnd I’ll remind you the national debt went up 40 percent\nover the 200-year — went up 40 percent under my predecessor. And that’s the problem we’re dealing with today.\nI might note parenthetically: In my first two years, I reduced the debt by $1.7 trillion. No President has ever done that.\nI told congressional leaders that I’m prepared to begin a separate discussion about my budget and spending priorities, but not under the threat of default.\nAs I said, I’ve already cut the deficit by $1.7 trillion in my first two years in office. And the budget just submitted to Congress cuts another $3 trillion in debt over the next 10 years — my budget that I submitted.\nI made it clear that we can cut spending and cut the deficit. For example, my budget cuts $200 billion in spending by strengthening Medicare’s power to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. In addition, that’s on top of the $160 billion in budget savings we passed last year by being able to reduce the price of insulin and other drugs for those on Medicare.\nAnd my budget cuts $30 billion — $30 billion in spending on tax subsidies for Big Oil companies. They made $200 billion. They don’t need a $30 billion subsidy to drill. It makes no sense. Why are we handing them a $30 billion tax subsidy?\nAnd, you know, it’s time to stop doing that. And that’s what my budget does, among — among other things.\nMy budget also funds the inerternal [sic] — the Internal Revenue Code so that there’s enough agents to thoroughly look at the taxes of billionaires in America. This Congressional Budget Office says it would raise $200 billion. Larry Summers, a former secretary, says — says it would raise twice that amount. It’ll raise a lot of money. Why do they want to get rid of the people who, in fact, would be able to do those audits?\nAnd my budget has some of the strongest anti-fraud proposals ever proposed. It strengthens the number of inspector generals. Remember, I know some of you covered me with my arguments in the past, with the last administration, for cutting inspector generals, as to how the money was being spent. And the inspector generals are watchdogs for taxpayers’ dollars. And it’s been estimated that we’d save $10 for every dollar spent on funding inspector generals.\nMy budget cuts wasteful spending, closes loopholes, and does one more thing: It makes the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations begin to start to pay some of their fair share — just some of their fair share.\nSpeaker McCarthy offered a very different way forward. He’s proposed deep cuts that I believe are going to hurt American families. And millions of Americans relying on Medicaid for their healthcare would be at risk of losing that.\nAnd there would be 30 million fewer outpatient visits for veterans to the VA hospitals. And we just increased the VA budget so they could accommodate seeing these folks.\nAnd we have to cut — we’d have to cut three- — 30,000 law enforcement agents — FBI, DEA, Border Patrol. A hundred thousand teachers and support personnel would lose their jobs.\nAnd all that would hurt Americans and leave folks behind.\nLook, now, I know the Speaker says, well, I’m not — he uses the “L word,” the “lying” word, but says I’m not telling the truth. All I asked him inside was: If you’re not going to cut any of those programs and you’re saying the cut is 22 percent across the board, then you’re going to have to cut a hell of a lot more with the programs that are left. “No, we’re not going to do that either.” I’m not sure. I don’t think they’re sure exactly what they’re proposing.\nAnd if House Republicans take cuts in defense off the table, the cuts they have to make to other programs will be even deeper than that.\nAnd one last thing that’s very important: The Speaker is saying he’s been trying to get me to sit down with him for 97 days. Ninety-seven days ago, we did meet in my office. I said to him at the time, “I’m happy to talk. You submit your budget; I’ll set mine — submit mine. And we’ll talk about it.”\nAnd I don’t want to get any press person — point anybody out, but I think you all remember my saying that.\nI submitted my budget on March the 9th in detail. He passed his plan I think in the last or second-to-last week in April. Five days later, after he finally put forward something, I called on him to invite — invite him to a meeting with the other leading members of the Congress.\nLook, over these last few days and weeks, there’s going to be — there’s a lot of politics posturing and gamesmanship, and it’s going to continue for a while. But I am squarely focused on what matters. And we’re getting to work.\nAnd I’ve said all along: Let’s discuss what we need to cut, what we need to protect, what new revenue we can raise, and how to lower the deficit to put our fiscal house in order. But in the meantime — in the meantime, we need to take the threat of default off the table.\nAs this meeting ended — as the meeting ended — (clears throat) — excuse me — I suggested we continue to meet, and the leaders — our staffs continue to meet, and the leaders meet again on Friday to continue our discussions to see what progress we’ve made.\nSo let me end where I began: This nation has never defaulted on its debt. It never will.\nAnd thank you. And now I’ll take your questions.\nYes, ma’am.\nQ Will you roll out a short-term debt limit increase? And are you concerned that Speaker McCarthy, at least publicly, will not take the threat of default off the table?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don’t know what he thinks — what McCarthy thi- — Speaker McCarthy thinks. I think he knows better. I think he knows that default would be disastrous. And I think he knows what he’s passed could not possibly pass anywhere in the Congress; it’s dead on arrival.\nAnd so — so, I — but I don’t know his — the depth of his thinking.\nYes.\nQ And what about a short-term debt limit increase? Are you ruling that out? Is that not okay for you?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’m not ruling anything out. I said I’d come back and talk. I’m just ruling — there’s one thing I’m ruling out is default. And I’m not going to vote — I’m not going to pass a budget that, in fact, caused massive cuts.\nI’ll give you one example. They want to cut the I- — the — the — the legislation we passed, the IRA. Well, guess what — what they want to cut? They say that we’re spending too much, giving tax breaks to people who are moving to renewable energy, and that by getting rid of those tax breaks we can — we can — we can save li- — save money.\nWell, you all saw — one of you probably wrote the article in today’s New York Times about Texas. They’re making significant progress on solar and wind and renewable energy and hydrogen. And guess what? They want to cut it. You know why? I don’t think it’s anything to do with anything other than the oil companies don’t like it.\nQ How certain are you at this point that a default can be avoided with so little time left?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m — I’m absolutely certain because I — you have the 95 percent of the member — well, I shouldn’t say — I won’t be — put in a number. An overwhelming number of the members of Congress know it would be a disaster.\nQ Mr. President, if you do — you said you’re certain you’re not going to — they’re not going to — there won’t be a default. Are you willing to take unilateral action, like invoking the 14th Amendment, to make sure that doesn’t happen?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, the question — I have been considering the 14th Amendment. And a man I have enormous respect for, Larry Tribe, who advised me for a long time, thinks that it would be legitimate. But the problem is it would have to be litigated. And in the meantime, without an extension, it would still end up in the same place.\nI’ll be very blunt with you: When we get by this, I’m thinking about taking a look at — months down the road — to see whether — what the court would say about whether or not the — it does work.\nYes, sir.\nQ Do you have time to get a deal and get it through before the deadline of as early as January [sic] 1st, and Secretary Yellen has warned about?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, I know we have the time. I mean, we could do it easily if they — if — but we do we have the will?\nQ And you mentioned the 14th, sir. There’s other proposals like prioritization of payments and minting the coin. Can you speak to whether either of those have been studied by your staff?\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I can’t because I don’t think anybody has studied the minting of the coin issue. But there have been discussions about whether or not the 14th Amendment is — can be invoked.\nQ Is that the most likely unilateral executive path —\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, yeah, but I —\nQ — worst-case scenario?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I — I don’t — I don’t think that solves our problem now. I think that only solves your problem if — once the court has ruled that it does apply for future ene- — endeavors.\nYes, sir.\nQ Mr. President, do you trust Kevin McCarthy?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I — I — I — I trust Kevin will try to do what he says.\nI don’t know that — I don’t know how much leeway Kevin McCarthy thinks he has in light of the fact — and I’m not being a wise guy when I say it took 15 votes for him to acquire the speakership. And, apparently, he had to make some serious concessions to get it from the most extreme elements of his party. So, I — but I don’t — I just don’t know.\nQ How long an increase are you seeking? How long would you like to extend it either by dollar value, or do you want it suspended indefinitely?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well —\nQ The limit, I mean.\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no, no, I — I think we should — it should be more than — for more than a year so we can move things along. And I think the discussions are somewhere — somewhere in two- — the two-year. But there’s no certainty of when — how long.\nQ Past the election though?\nQ Mr. President, was Speaker McCarthy’s message to you behind closed doors the same one that we heard from him at the sticks: that he will absolutely not decouple raising the debt ceiling with cuts? Did he send that message to you?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I — I don’t want to violate a — basically a trust that we had that we can — you can talk openly and make — and raise possibilities in the White House with the — on a — on a closed meeting.\nQ On another topic, sir. Today, former President Donald Trump was charged with battery and defamation. Your reaction to that, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’m unaware of it. I heard that as I’ve been walking from room to room, but I can’t comment on it. I don’t know.\nQ Let us ask it this way: What was the tenor of the meeting? Was it civil?\nTHE PRESIDENT: The tenor of the meeting was —\nQ Was it frank? Or what?\nTHE PRESIDENT: — with three of the four participants — very measured and — and low key. Occasionally there would be a little bit of a — an assertion that maybe was a little over the top from the Speaker. But nothing, you know — anyway.\nQ Do you expect any — do you expect any substantial progress by the time you get back to meeting on Friday?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s going to depend a lot on — I’ve been doing this a long time. I don’t mean budget negotiations for the debt ceiling. But sometimes — how can I say this?\nOne of the ways in which senators or congresspersons are able to back off some of the things they’ve done is if they’re — give their staff some leeway, and the staff has then said, “Well, we’re going to do this.” And it moves — it kicks the can down the road a little bit.\nQ Is there any chance you would postpone your trip for the G7 as a result of this? Or are you — are you still committed to going on that trip?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’m still committed, but obviously this is the single most important thing that’s on the agenda.\nQ Mr. President — Mr. President, under the —\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me get someone who hasn’t asked a question yet. Anybody? I’ll call — I’ll ask yours as well.\nYes, ma’am.\nQ So there is doubt that you might not go on your trip? And you say this is the single most important issue.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry?\nQ Is it possible that you stay here and you don’t find a solution?\nTHE PRESIDENT: It is possible, but not likely. In other words, if somehow we got down to the wire and we still hadn’t resolved this, and the — the due date was in a matter of — when I was supposed to be away, I would not go. I would stay until this gets finished.\nQ Are you more — are you more or less optimistic than you were this morning after this meeting?\nTHE PRESIDENT: More.\nQ Why?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because I’m a born optimist.\nQ Mr. President, was it a mistake under the Obama administration, when you were Vice President, to negotiate on the debt limit in the summer of 2011, since that set a precedent under a divided government to at least negotiate and have discussions over raising the debt limit?\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, in the sense that — I got a call that morning at six o’clock saying that the Republican leader would only talk to me, and there was no time left. And so I sat down, and I got instructions from the White House to settle it. And that was my job. But I had no notice.\nQ Sir, just to put a finer point on today —\nQ Mr. President, Speaker McCarthy said he asked you numerous times —\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay, I’m going to — let me go with you and you and then to the person with a camera. No, I’m joking. (Laughter.)\nQ Speaker McCarthy said that he asked you numerous times if there was anywhere in the federal budget for cuts, but he did not get an answer. So is there anywhere —\nTHE PRESIDENT: He got a specific answer. He got a specific answer again today. The first —\nQ Which is what?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I — well, you didn’t listen either. So why should I even answer the question?\nI — we cut the deficit by $160 billion — billion — B-I-L-O-I-O-N — dollars on the Medicare deal. We cut the deficit by raising the tax on people making — 55 corporations that made $40 billion to 15 percent. And the list goes on. So —\nQ But in terms of what he is proposing, is there any room for negotiation?\nTHE PRESIDENT: What’s he proposing? Did he tell you?\nQ Well, he —\nTHE PRESIDENT: Did you hear him?\nQ — he talked about —\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no, I’m not being facetious. Did he tell you what he’s proposing?\nQ He — he was talking about the bill.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah. But what — what does it propose? Do you know?\nI’m not being a wise guy. You all are very, very informed people. Do you know what that bill cuts?\nQ He — there is a long list of things that it — it cuts that he —\nTHE PRESIDENT: No. No, it doesn’t say. It says — does it say what it’s going to cut or just say generically it’s going to cut?\nYou get the problem. You’ve answered.\nQ Mr. President, Speaker McCarthy told us outside that he wants at least you to consider cutting and clawing back some of the unspent COVID relief funds. Would that be something that you would consider, even if it’s independent of these debt limit discussions?\nTHE PRESIDENT: The answer is I’d take a hard look at it, because there’s still — we don’t need it all, but the question is what obligations were there made — commitments made, the money not dispersed, et cetera. I have to look — take a hard look at it. It’s o- — on — it’s on the table.\nQ And just briefly, sir, to put a finer point on it, the — the lawmakers came out today, and their message was, essentially, there wasn’t much substantial progress in the meeting. Do you agree with that?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I listened to everything they said. I didn’t hear them say that.\nQ Well, they — they said there was no movement.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah, but what else did they say?\nQ The Speaker said there was no movement.\nQ The Speaker. So do you think that there was any substantial progress, aside from agreeing to meet again?\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Yes, among three of the fi- — of the four, yes, there was substantial movement in the sense that everyone agreed that deficit — defaulting on the debt is off the table.\nLast one, okay?\nQ Title 42. Is the United States ready for the surge of people that’s going to come across the border starting later this week?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I spent close to an hour with — with the Mexican President today. We’re doing all we can. The answer is: It remains to be seen.\nWe’ve gotten overwhelming cooperation from Mexico. We also are in the process of setting up resi- — offices in Colombia and other places where you could — where someone seeking asylum can go first.\nSo — but it remains to be seen. It’s going to be chaotic for a while. And, as an example, as I raised in the meeting — when they said, “Well, we’re going to cut, and no spending more money.” So what the hell happens? If you cut — you’re going to cut people at the border? You’re going to cut agents at the border? We n- — we need more at the border, not less at the border.\nFolks, thank you very, very much. I appreciate your time. And I’m sure we’re going to be talking more about this.\nThank you.\nQ Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Whatever the cameraman wants to know, I’ll answer. (Laughter.)\nThank you very much. I really mean it.\nQ He wants to know if — if the U.S. defaults, will you be able to say that you did everything in your power to avoid it?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I promise you —\nQ I think he said —\nTHE PRESIDENT: — I will do everything in my power to avoid it.\nThank you.\nQ Thank you, Mr. President.\n6:57 P.M.

It’s good to see everyone here today.\nSo last month, President Trump said he supports repealing the debt limit. So do I. So there we are: Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren are singing from the same hymnal.\nMr. Bessent, let’s make it a trio. Do you agree with President-elect Trump that the debt limit should be repealed?\nMr. Scott Bessent, nominee for Secretary of the Treasury: Senator Warren, first of all, I enjoyed our visit in your office and appreciate the fact that when I walked in, you said “let's talk about what we have in common”: our love of Cape Cod, the Red Sox, and addressing the affordability crisis and the housing shortage.\nSo, the debt limit is a very nuanced convention. What I would like to do is get back to you and President Trump. I would like to do a survey of market participants with this amount of debt. It is a very fragile equilibrium that we sell bonds in.\nSenator Warren: Mr. Bessent, forgive me for just a minute here. I'm not asking whether or not we ought to increase our debt. I’m asking a very different question, and that is whether or not we should have a statute in place that says there’s a debt limit that if we don't increase the debt limit, would cause us to default. That’s not an economic analysis.\nIn fact, let me ask you. I understand earlier, you were citing the Congressional Budget Office. Have you seen the Congressional Budget Office projections of what would happen if the United States government defaulted its debt? That is, if we hit the debt limit and just kept on going without raising it or eliminating it.\nMr. Bessent: Look, Senator Warren, the United States is not going to default on its debt, if I'm confirmed, but, you know, I will tell you that for people who don't understand the debt limit, it might be like taking out your hand brake in your car. That you can still hit the brakes, but it is one less feature –\nSenator Warren: But I thought you just said you’d never use it? So you’re talking about a hand brake that appears to be there, but in fact is not connected to a braking system. It is literally never used, right?\nMr. Bessent: I've never pulled the handbrake going 60 miles an hour in my car. I hope never to.\nSenator Warren: And the reason for that, I assume, is the enormous cost of a debt default. In fact, Moody’s estimated that a debt limit breach would cost the U.S. economy $12 trillion and cost 6 million people their jobs. I think this is the reason that President-elect Trump said eliminating the debt limit is “The smartest thing Congress can do.” And I would like for Congress to do the smartest thing, and that is eliminate the debt limit, so we don't have this problem.\nMr. Bessent: Senator Warren, I will tell you that once President Trump takes office, and if I’m confirmed, if he wants to eliminate the debt limit, I will work with him and you on that.\nSenator Warren: Great. Great, because I agree with President-elect Trump that the debt limit should be repealed. I know, however, right now that's not what congressional Republicans plan to do. Last month, they committed to raising the debt limit by another 1.5 trillion dollars.\nSo why do Republicans want to raise the debt ceiling? Because their plan is to shovel new tax cuts to billionaires, and that would increase the debt by more than one trillion dollars, just in the next four-year period. During his first term, President Trump's only major legislative achievement was his 2017 tax cuts, that mostly got sucked up by millionaires, billionaires, and giant corporations. Now, most of these cuts were good for only eight years, so that Republicans, who were designing them, could claim that the cost was “only” $2 trillion. Eight years of cuts that added $2 trillion to the debt. Now we’re talking about Republicans and President-elect Trump who want to give the same rich people and giant corporations more years of tax cuts.\nAnd I just want to be clear that we understand each other here, that I think it was Senator Warnock who asked you about, is there any billionaire rich enough and who you wouldn’t support a tax cut for going forward?\nMr. Bessent: I think it’s unwise to single out –\nSenator Warren: Rich people?\nMr. Bessent: Any individual.\nSenator Warren: Ok. Is there any group of billionaires? You can just pick a dollar figure and there can be more than one of that.\nMr. Bessent: I could give you a glib answer, but I won’t. But again, that is not where the money is. At one point, when President Obama was debating Mitt Romney, the moderator said, “but sir, that would make collections go down,” and he said, “Yeah, but it’s about fairness.” And I have to tell you, Senator Warren, I’m about collections.\nSenator Warren: I understand, but I like to think that fairness is about billionaires actually paying their fair share, too.\n###\nNext Article Previous Article\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Why Does Trump Want the Debt Ceiling Raised Now?\nOn Tuesday, Professor Buchanan wrote on this blog that he and I had \"found one silver lining in the current political cataclysm, and that is that we will almost surely never again have reason to write about the debt ceiling . . . .\" Although I agreed (as I usually do) with nearly everything else he wrote there, I'm going to prove him wrong on this one, because the debt ceiling is back in the news. Yesterday, the following \"statement from President Donald J. Trump and Vice President-Elect JD Vance\" was posted on Vance's X account:\nThe most foolish and inept thing ever done by Congressional Republicans was allowing our country to hit the debt ceiling in 2025. It was a mistake and is now something that must be addressed. . . . Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we’d rather do it on Biden’s watch. If Democrats won’t cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let’s have this debate now. And we should pass a streamlined spending bill that doesn’t give Chuck Schumer and the Democrats everything they want.\nThe ellipsis indicates my omission of some nonsense about Liz Cheney, and the statement continued after what I've quoted above with some further nonsense, but I want to focus only on the foregoing language, concerning the debt ceiling.\nTo begin, notice that, according to Trump and Vance, the \"foolish and inept thing\" was not the fact that Congress suspended the debt ceiling only until January 2025. (The June date presumably reflects a projection that the so-called \"extraordinary measures\" which we can expect the Treasury Department to employ will have been exhausted by then.) That was indeed foolish. Congress should have suspended it indefinitely, raised it so high that it cannot be reached as a practical matter for centuries, or, best of all, repealed it, because--as Professor Buchanan and I have explained ad infinitum--the debt ceiling is a wholly unnecessary statute that does not constrain debt but can only cause mischief. But no, that, according to Trump and Vance, is not what was foolish. The foolish (and inept) thing \"was allowing our country to hit the debt ceiling in 2025.\"\nYet, in 2023 (when the issue last came to a head), the only way that Congress could have avoided hitting the debt ceiling was by raising, suspending, or repealing it. The implicit suggestion of Trump and Vance, however, is that Congress could have avoided hitting the ceiling by passing laws that led the government to take in as much money as it was spending, including spending on debt service. During Trump's first term, however, the government never came close to running a surplus. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic led to (justified) increased spending, the national debt grew each year of the first Trump administration, thanks in no small part to the tax cuts (mostly for the wealthy) that he signed into law.\nTo be clear, we at DoL don't think that increasing the national debt is necessarily bad. More often than not, the government has erred by spending too little (as in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis) or focusing too soon on deficit reduction (as manifested by the disastrous 1937 double-dip due to FDR's premature pivot). But if one is going to be a deficit and debt hawk, one should start with realistic numbers. Even if Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy get nearly all of the cruel cuts to non-military discretionary spending they want, they will not generate enough savings on the expenditure side to balance the budget and thus obviate the need to raise the debt ceiling.\nAnd Trump and Vance know it. That's why they acknowledge that a failure to raise (or suspend or repeal) the debt ceiling now will necessitate raising (or suspending or repealing) it at some point in 2025, though not necessarily in June. The debt ceiling comes back into effect in mid-January. Extraordinary measures typically generate only about three months of extra time, which would take us to mid-April, not June.\nBut let's suppose they are right about June. If so, the incoming Trump administration would have four-and-a-half to five months to cut spending enough to balance the budget and therefore necessitate no new borrowing authority. Presumably, with a compliant House and Senate, they could get any package of spending cuts they wanted. (They might be able to get deficit-narrowing tax increases too, but that's certainly not on the agenda for a Republican administration.) The fact that Trump and Vance recognize the need to raise (or suspend or repeal) the debt ceiling before extraordinary measures run out shows that they also recognize that their antecedent claim--the claim that Congress was foolish and inept to continue to run up debt--was self-serving baloney. They too will run up debt.\nThat context seemingly explains the current moment. During his first term, Trump had no qualms about raising the debt ceiling. In 2018 and again in 2019, he signed bills that suspended it (which is the equivalent of raising it, because when it awakens, it resets to the new level of debt). However, during last year's nearly disastrous negotiations, Trump opposed the deal that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck with President Biden to suspend the debt ceiling--ostensibly because he wanted fiscal reforms but in reality for the same reason he killed the border security bill that Republicans had negotiated: to prevent President Biden from winning a political victory.\nWhat we have here appears to be pure politics. Republicans have spent so much time over the last 13 years (since the first debt ceiling crisis occasioned by Republican intransigence in 2011) trying to confuse the public (and in the process, sometimes confusing themselves) into believing that raising the debt ceiling is itself a form of profligacy, that it would be awkward for them to raise or suspend it next year. Thus, Trump and Vance want the ceiling raised or suspended on Biden's watch.\nOr so it might seem. The difficulty with the foregoing analysis is its assumption that Trump would pay any political price for further flip-flopping on the debt ceiling. If Trump signs a bill suspending the debt ceiling in 2025 without obtaining spending cuts or other measures that make a substantial difference in the path of government debt, the fact that this will show his prior opposition to have been hypocritical will matter not a whit to him, nor to the compliant press, nor to his supporters. If Trump tells his supporters we have always been at war with Eastasia, they will believe him. And much of the media will report what he said, while dutifully noting that Democrats say otherwise, but not actually reporting on reality.\nBecause Trump is beyond being shamed by exposure as a hypocrite, we need some other explanation for his willingness to risk a government shutdown for which he could be blamed as the price of getting a debt ceiling bill now rather than once he's president. One possibility is that he doesn't believe he can count on the most rabid House Republicans--the ones who actually appear to believe that defaulting wouldn't be disastrous--to vote for a debt ceiling increase or suspension ever. If so, he needs support from Democrats, and he probably assumes that Democrats will be more willing to vote for a debt ceiling suspension with Biden in the White House than when Trump returns.\nBut that doesn't quite fly either. If the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended before extraordinary measures run out in 2025, Trump will be president during the ensuing disaster. Biden will be out of office before the disaster, so Democrats have no special reason to think that they need to protect him by voting for a debt ceiling suspension or increase now. Meanwhile, because Democrats are unlikely to emulate Republicans by taking the global economy hostage, Trump probably can count on enough congressional Democratic support to increase or suspend the debt ceiling next year, even if the hardest-core economic ignoramuses in his own party refuse to vote to do so.\nIn the end, then, we have a mystery. It is difficult to identify a reason why Trump and Vance are insisting that the debt ceiling be increased or suspended now. Maybe he wants to saddle Biden with a government shutdown because he thinks the public will blame Biden for it, or if not Biden, then congressional Republicans, but not him while he awaits inauguration. Or maybe there is no coherent rationale. Maybe now, as so often in the past, Trump isn't playing three-dimensional chess; he's just eating the pieces.\n------------\nPostscript: This is probably my last blog post for 2024.

She said she doesn't want to see Washington return to the failed policies of Republican administrations, and said Donald Trump does not have a plan that will work.\nShe acknowledged that while the economy is coming back, not everyone has reaped the benefits.\n\"We need a president who knows what we're up against, has no illusions about it, and can get it done,\" she said.\nShe said her plan includes making college debt-free for all, getting companies to share profits with their employees and ship less jobs overseas, and making sure corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes.\n\"Markets work best when all the stakeholders share in the benefits,\" she said.\nAny by all stakeholders, Clinton spoke about North Carolina's controversial HB2 law and said LGBT people can't be shut out of opportunities.\nClinton said in her first 100 days in office she'd reach out to Congress to break the gridlock.\n\"It takes experience working with both parties to get results,\" she said.\nClinton also focused on education, saying Republicans in North Carolina have done lasting harm to the public school system.\n\"North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education. Now, thanks to your governor and legislature the average teacher salary can barely support a family,\" she said.\nGovernor Pat McCrory's campaign manager fired back at Clinton after her Raleigh stop.\n\"North Carolina has experienced one of the fastest growing economies in the country, $4.4 billion in tax relief, more than $1 billion in budget surpluses and the largest teacher pay raises in the country under Governor McCrory's leadership,\" said Russell Peck.\nThe former secretary of state and first lady last visited North Carolina the day before the state's March 15 presidential primary.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Hillary Clinton has talked frequently about how she would address education during her campaign. CNN’s Reality Check Team put her statements and assertions to the test.\nThe team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speech and selected key statements, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it’s complicated.\nReality Check: Clinton on Affordable College\nAugust 11, 2016\nBy Amy Gallagher, CNN\nIn her speech on the economy, Clinton spoke to a deep concern for many working parents - how they’ll afford college for their kids.\n“It’s crucial that every American has access to the education and skills they need to get the jobs of the future. So we will fight to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for everyone.”\nSome context here: Clinton’s final plan is the direct result of the push and pull between her and Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. Sanders touted his plan for “tuition-free college for all” - defining this as free tuition at public universities in a student’s home state. Clinton at first countered that she would make community college tuition-free. When it was clear that Clinton was losing younger voters to Sanders, she shifted her position and offered a new proposal for free tuition at public colleges, but she was clear “I don’t want to make college free for Donald Trump’s kids.”\nRelated: Would you get free tuition under Hillary Clinton?\nAccording to her campaign website, her proposed plan does not cover families with household incomes over $125,000 a year. That means her plan does cover about 80% of American families. What constitutes “middle class” is debatable, but if you accept her definition of the middle class, the math checks out, so we rate the tuition portion of her claim: TRUE.\nBut what about “debt-free for everyone”? Her tuition plan would not cover room and board, fees, books or supplies and these are often a significant portion of the cost of college. Even families that can afford tuition may still have to take out loans to cover all the other costs of college, so we rate this portion of her claim FALSE.\nReality Check: Clinton on North Carolina teachers and blame\nJune 22, 2016\nBy Eve Bower, CNN\nSpeaking in Raleigh Wednesday about both economic conditions and the quality of public education in the state of North Carolina, Clinton blamed the state’s Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and Republican-majority legislature for low teacher salaries.\n“For many years,” Clinton said, “North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education. Now, unfortunately, thanks to your governor and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family.”\nClinton’s claim about current teacher salaries, on average, appears true. Using numbers from the last Census, the average North Carolina household has 2.48 people. For the purpose of this analysis, we will use the Living Wage Calculator developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning, and explore how two different possible family structures would fare on a public school teacher’s salary.\nFirst, assuming a family consists of one adult and two children, using the Living Wage Calculator, this household in North Carolina requires $54,197 in annual pre-tax income in order to cover basic expenses including things like food, housing, and medical care.\nIf we instead assume that a family consists of two adults – only one of whom earns an income, and one who is responsible for child care – this household in North Carolina requires $43,033 in annual pre-tax income to cover basic expenses.\nThe major difference between the two consists of the average $9,611 per year a single parent spends on child care for two children. But neither amount affords teacher-headed families a luxurious life: according to the National Education Association’s latest data, in the 2015-16 school year, the average salary for classroom teachers in North Carolina was just $47,985 – more than $6,200 less than what is required for a “living wage” for the first family, and just a few thousand dollars more than what is required by the second.\nBut Clinton’s claim is misleading where it places the blame for this solely on the Republicans currently in North Carolina state government. A recent report from the National Education Association found North Carolina third among states with the largest real decline in average teacher salaries over the decade from 2004-2015, with an inflation-adjusted decrease in salary of 10.2%. McCrory may be partially responsible for this, as he was elected in 2012, but he has only had influence over teacher salaries since 2013. McCrory was preceded by almost 20 years of Democratic governors, during which time the Senate was controlled by Democrats the entire time, and Democrats controlled the state House from 1999-2010.\nClinton was correct that public school teachers, on average, have a difficult time making ends meet today in North Carolina. We rate that portion of her claim true. But by placing the blame for this exclusively on the state’s current Republican leadership, when the trends have existed through several Democratic administrations, we must rate the second portion of her claim as FALSE.\nReality Check: Clinton on states disinvesting from higher education\nDecember 19, 2015\nBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoney\nState finances were crushed in the wake of the Great Recession, which began in late 2007. States were forced to enact steep funding cuts, since they are required to balance their budgets annually.\nOn Saturday, Clinton said “states have been disinvesting in higher education.” She’s right: The ax fell heavily on higher education budgets, forcing public colleges in many states to hike tuition and fees.\nSome 47 states spent less per student in the 2014-15 school year than they did in 2008, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Only Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming spent more.\nStates are spending 20% less per student than they did in the 2007-08 school year, on average, according to the center. In Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and South Carolina, spending per student is down by more than 35%.\nAs a result, tuition at public colleges has soared. Tuition at four-year state colleges has risen by $2,000, or 29% percent, since the 2007-08 school year. In Arizona, tuition spiked more than 80%, while in California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii and Louisiana, tuition is up more than 60%.\nMost states have started spending more on higher education. The trend reversed in 2013, according to a report from the State Higher Education Executive Officers.\nSome 35 states have increased higher ed budgets for fiscal year 2016, which started in July in most states, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. Some 12 states have cut funding for colleges.\nSo while most states have a ways to go before they get back to pre-recession funding levels, the trend is for more spending on colleges.\nVerdict: TRUE, BUT MISLEADING\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Child Care Stabilization Grants\nExtended!

The first dashboard gives insight into the impact of this historic investment, showing the total child care capacity and jobs that are supported by the grants both as a statewide to-date total and by county in an interactive map. The second dashboard illustrates the strength of NCDHHS’s commitment to the state’s early care and learning network by showing the total stabilization grant dollars paid to-date to child care programs statewide, and a pie chart of grantees by program type. This dashboard also features an interactive map of stabilization grant payment totals by county with several display options: All Payments, Fixed Cost Payments, Compensation Support Payments, [Child Care] Center Payments, [Family Child Care] Home Payments.\nABOUT CHILD CARE STABILIZATION GRANTS\nOn October 7, 2021, Governor Roy Cooper announced a historic, one-time federal $805 million investment in North Carolina’s early care and learning programs. The North Carolina Child Care Stabilization Grants, made possible by funding from the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, support working families with access to high-quality, affordable child care. The grants also help early care and learning programs with recruitment and retention, enabling them to provide better wages and benefits to teachers, and promoting equity for all—children, parents, and teachers.\nThere are two components of North Carolina’s Child Care Stabilization Grants. The two components are intended to grant early care and learning programs funds to facilitate high quality early childhood education at its true cost and increase compensation to staff. Each approved program receives a Fixed Costs and Families Grant, based on capacity, subsidized child care enrollment, program quality (star rating), infant/toddler enrollment, and community context (using Social Vulnerability Index).\nApproved programs that elect to receive additional funding will also be awarded Compensation Supports Grants. There are two options for Compensation Supports. Programs selecting Option 1 agree to use the additional funding to provide bonuses to all staff. By selecting Option 2, approved early childhood programs agree to increase base pay and/or benefits, implementing a compensation scale that ideally factors in education and length of service as well as job responsibilities.\nEligibility\nLicensed Child Care Programs that are eligible for Stabilization Grant funding must:\n- Hold a license or be regulated under a notice of compliance by DCDEE on or before March 11, 2021, or\n- Hold a current license or a notice of compliance and be eligible to participate in the Subsidized Child Care Assistance Program.\nAllowable Uses for Grant Funds\nFunds received for Compensation Supports must be spent on personnel costs as described when awarded.\nFixed Cost and Families Grant funds can be used for:\n- Tuition Assistance to Families\n- Personnel costs, including payroll, salaries, similar employee compensation, employee benefits, retirement costs, educational costs, child care costs; and supporting staff expenses in accessing COVID-19 vaccines;\n- Rent (including under a lease agreement) or payment on any mortgage obligation, utilities, or insurance; also, may include late fees or charges related to late payments;\n- Facility maintenance or improvements, defined as minor renovations, including outdoor learning spaces/playgrounds, and minor improvements to address COVID-19 concerns;\n- Personal protective equipment, cleaning and sanitization supplies and services, or training and professional development related to health and safety practices;\n- Purchases of or updates to equipment and supplies to respond to COVID–19;\n- Goods and services necessary to maintain or resume child care services;\n- Mental health supports for children and employees;\n- Health and safety trainings for staff, including but not limited to CPR, First Aid, and medication administration.\nMonitoring\nDCDEE monitors the stabilization grants program to ensure child care program grantees use funds for allowed uses only and in compliance with the Terms and Conditions. If an audit finds no problems, the child care program will receive a letter notifying them of the audit result. If an audit reveals any issues, the auditor will contact the child care program with any questions or to request documentation. Grantees must cooperate and respond to any instructions from DCDEE auditors.\nRESOURCES\nTRAINING\nNote: certificates are not offered for viewing these recordings.\nWATCH: Stabilization Grants Training 1 - NC Stabilization Grant Application\nGet the slide deck from NC Stabilization Grant Application 2021-2022 (PDF)\nWATCH: Stabilization Grants Training 2 - Using Your NC Stabilization Grant\nGet the slide deck from Using Your NC Stabilization Grant (PDF)\nWATCH: Stabilization Grants Training 3 – Introduction to Quarterly Reporting\nGet the slide deck from Introduction to Quarterly Reporting (PDF)\nWATCH: Stabilization Grants Training 4 – Recertification Information Session\nGet the slide deck from Recertification Information Session\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}
